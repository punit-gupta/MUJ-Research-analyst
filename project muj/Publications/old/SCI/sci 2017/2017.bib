	abstract = {A series of multifunctional carbohydrazide based chromofluorescent sensor molecules derived from carbohydrazide, 4-formyl-1-substituted phenyl-pyrazole-3-carboxylate and 2-hydroxy-naphthaldehyde were successfully designed and synthesized. The synthesized sensor molecules exhibit significant red shift in their absorption spectra with visual color changes on interaction with Cu({II}) and Zn({II}) ions. In addition, the optimized sensor showed excellent selectivity towards Cu({II}) and Zn({II}) ions with fluorescence turn off and turn on modes respectively. Along with this, anion recognition studies were carried out using {UV}-visible and fluorescence spectrophotometric titrations which revealed that synthesized sensors also exhibit selective sensing of F-, {CH}3COO- and H2PO4- ions via H-bond interaction and subsequent deprotonation to elicit distinct visual color change from light yellow to orange with significant quenching in its emission intensity. Furthermore, the in-situ prepared sensor-anion adduct solution exhibited colorimetric “On-Off”sensing of Cu({II}) and Zn({II}) ions, which was confirmed through {UV}-visible titration experiments.},

The inner territory of the channel consists of two regions; one of them is filled with porous material and second is clear fluid. At the porous medium fluid interface, interfacial coupling conditions for the fluid velocity, temperature and concentration were used to derive the analytical solution. Some standard values of Schmidt number like Hydrogen(0.22), Helium(0.30), Amonia(0.78); Eckert number (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2) and Prandtl number for water(0.71) and Air(7.0) was considered in this paper. The effects of pertinent physical fluid parameter like porosity, viscosity ratio, density ratio etc. on velocity, temperature and concentration distribution are considered and demonstrated through graphs. Heavier diffusive species and high molecular diffusivity ratio decreases the fluid concentration throughout the region. Increasing values of Prandtl number upsurge the fluid temperature throughout the region.},

Ball-end milling experiments have been planned using central composite design based on response surface methodology. The mathematical models have been established and tested for adequacy. A full quadratic model has been adopted for modelling. It has been found that axial depth of cut is the most dominant cutting parameter for the tangential and axial cutting forces, accounting for 49.38 and 47.12\% contributions, respectively. Radial depth of cut is the most dominant parameter for radial force and contributes 69.94\% for it. Results also revealed that force components decrease with increase in cutting speed. There is very small variation in cutting force components in the cutting speed range of 75-150 m/min at lower values of axial and radial depth of cut. Surface roughness is effected by cutting speed largely followed by feed. Multi-objective optimization has been performed using composite desirability to optimize the cutting parameters for minimum surface roughness and cutting forces simultaneously. Confirmation tests have been conducted using optimal set of cutting parameters. The results of confirmation tests are very close to the predicted results.},

	abstract = {Automobile emissions are the main source of greenhouse gases ({GHG}) accumulation in environment. As old engines (Euro {III} or earlier) produce more emissions and it will be difficult to entirely stop their usage especially in developing and underdeveloped nations, it is desired that appropriate emission reduction technologies are tested on such engines to analyze their feasibility and economical acceptability. While most such studies have been conducted on constant speed stationary engines and modern engines, this study tried to analyze the effectiveness of exhaust gas recirculation ({EGR}) system on a Euro-1, water-cooled, direct injection, variable speed, compression ignition (C.I.) engine in a laboratory setup in India. This was done by testing an electronic control unit ({ECU})-controlled {EGR} valve running the engine on different speeds; with different torques, as also with varying {EGR} percentages. Then optimum value of {EGR} valve opening for each set of engine speed and torque was determined, that is, corresponding to minimum oxides of nitrogen ({NOx}). Optimum {EGR} valve position was programmatically fed, for each set of torque and engine speed (in {RPM}), into {EGR} {ECU} and then the engine was run at varying speeds and torques and the emissions were verified in the automated mode. It was found that using {EGR}, {NOx} emissions were substantially reduced (average 45\% reduction), without significantly impacting the engine performance. However, smoke emission increased with {EGR}. In order to counter the adverse effects, additional emission reduction technologies should be used in tandem with {EGR}.

This paper reports the optical gain in strained {InGaAsP}/{GaAsSb} type-{II} {QW} heterostructure (well width = 20 angstrom) under external uniaxial strain at room temperature (300 K). The entire heterostructure is supposed to be grown on {InP} substrate pseudomorphically.

(p) over right arrow Hamiltonian matrix of the system is evaluated and Luttinger-Kohn model has been applied for the band structure and wavefunction calculations. {TE} mode optical gain spectrum in the {QW}-heterostructure under uniaxial strain along [110] is calculated. Optical gain of the heterostructure as a function of 2D carrier density and temperature variation is investigated. The variation of the peak optical gain as a function of As and Sb fractions in {InGaAsP} as a barrier and {GaAsSb} as a well respectively is exhibited. For a charge carrier injection of 5 x 10(12)/cm(2), the {TE} optical gain is 3952 cm(-1) at room temperature under no external uniaxial strain. Significant increase in {TE} mode optical gain is observed under high external uniaxial strain (1, 5 and 10 {GPa}) along [110] within {IR} (Infrared region) region. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The geometric features of planar surfaces are decomposed into four components; namely straightness, flatness, perpendicularity, and parallelism. A non-linear minimum zone objective function is formulated mathematically for each planar surface geometric characteristic. Finally, the result of the proposed method is compared with previous work on the same problem and with other nature inspired algorithms. The results demonstrate that the proposed {MPSO} algorithm is more efficient and accurate in comparison to other algorithms and is well suited for effective and accurate evaluation of planar surface characteristics.},

Targeting neuroinflammation could be of prime importance as recent research highlights the beneficial aspects associated with modulating the inflammatory mediators associated with the {CNS}. One of the main obstructions in neuroinflammatory treatments is the hindrance posed by the blood-brain barrier for the delivery of drugs. Hence, research has focused on novel modes of transport for drugs to cross the barrier through drug delivery and nanotechnology approaches.

The microchannel walls are deformable and transmit periodic waves. The Chakraborty-Roy nanofluid electrokinetic formulation is adopted in which Joule heating effects are incorporated. Soret and Dufour cross-diffusion effects are also considered. Under low Reynolds number (negligible inertial effects), long wavelength and Debye linearization approximations, the governing partial differential equations for mass, momentum, energy and solute concentration conservation are derived with appropriate boundary conditions at the micro-channel walls. The merging model features a number of important thermo-physical, electrical and nanoscale parameter, namely thermal and solutal Grashof numbers, the Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity (maximum electro-osmotic velocity) and Joule heating to surface heat flux ratio. Closed-form solutions are derived for the solute concentration, temperature, axial velocity, averaged volumetric flow rate, pressure difference across one wavelength, and stream function distribution in the wave frame. Additionally expressions are presented for the surface shear stress function at the wall (skin friction coefficient), wall heat transfer rate (Nusselt number) and wall solute mass transfer rate (Sherwood number). The influence of selected parameters on these flow variables is studied with the aid of graphs. Bolus formation is also visualized and analyzed in detail. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Subsequently, structure-homology based {PolyPhen}-2 (Polymorphism Phenotyping) analysis predicted 9 of 23 {nsSNPs} (K4T, E31A, E31K, S41Y, I55N, P59L, P59S, L70P and V88D) to be damaging. According to the conditional hypothesis for the study, only {nsSNPs} that score damaging/deleterious prediction in both sequence and structural homology-based approach will be considered as `high-confidence  {nsSNPs}. In step 2, based on conservation of amino acid residues, stability analysis, structural superimposition, {RSMD} and docking analysis, the possible structural-functional relationship was ascertained for high-confidence {nsSNPs}. Finally, in a separate analysis (step 3), the {IL}-8 deregulation has also appeared to be an important prognostic marker for detection of patients with gastric and lung cancer.

We considered two different types of alloy nanoparticle namely nickel chromium iron alloy (Nimonic 80A) and titanium aluminum vanadium alloy (Ti\%6Al\%4V). The governing equations of the flow are solved using the Runge-Kutta and Newton s method. The present numerical results are compared with the previous study and found agreement with the uncertainty of +/- 2.5\%. Effects of various non dimensional parameters such as Eckert number, power index parameter, volume fraction, heat source/sink parameter, viscous variation parameter and semi-vertical angle of the cone on the momentum and thermal boundary layer including the friction factor coefficients and local Nusselt number are presented and analyzed for two different alloy considered in the present study. It is found that the viscous variation parameter enables to enhance the heat transfer rate. The Ti\%6Al\%4V alloy has higher friction factor coefficient along the azimuthal direction of the flow while Nimonic 80A alloy boosts up the friction coefficient along the tangential direction. It is worth to mention that the heat transfer rate of Nimonic 80A alloy is higher than that of Ti\%6Al\%4V alloy. Hence, Nimonic 80A alloy signifies a better thermal performance than the Ti\%6Al\%4V alloy. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Methods: The governing equations are reduced in linear form using dimensional analysis and considering the low Reynolds number and large wavelength approximations. The time dependent temperature field, axial velocity, transverse velocity and pressure difference are obtained analytically in closed form solution. Trapping phenomenon is also discussed with the help of contour plots of stream function. A comparative study of pure water (Newtonian fluid), Copper water nanofluids and Silver water nanofluids under the influence of relevant physical parameters is made in graphical form and also discussed. The effects of absorption parameter and Grashof number on velocity profiles, temperature profiles and pressure distribution along the length of channel are examined. Results conclusions: The computational results reveal that the velocity profile is maximum for Silver water nanofluids however, it is least for Copper water nanofluids. It is also concluded the temperature profile is more for pure water in comparison to Silver water and Copper water nanofluids.

The nanocrystalline nature of {PMMA} is seen to be preserved in the blends although there are clear indications of bond modifications. The addition of {PCTFE} results in the improvement of overall crystallinity of the films via the interaction among {PMMA} and degraded {PCTFE} molecules when the films are casted from diluted solutions. In agreement, corresponding disorder in terms of Urbach energy shows a decreasing trend upon inclusion of more and more {PCTFE} molecules.

Peristalsis is one of the most efficient of these mechanisms and offers considerable promise in microscale fluidics. Electrokinetic peristalsis has recently also stimulated significant attention. Electrical and magnetic fields also offer an excellent mode for regulating flows. Motivated by novel applications in electro-conductive microchannel transport systems, the current article investigates analytically the electromagnetic pumping of non-Newtonian aqueous electrolytes via peristaltic waves in a two-dimensional microchannel with different peristaltic waves propagating at the upper and lower channel wall (complex wavy scenario). The Stokes couple stress model is deployed to capture micro-structural characteristics of real working fluids. The unsteady two-dimensional conservation equations for mass and momentum conservation, electro-kinetic and magnetic body forces, are formulated in two dimensional Cartesian co-ordinates. The transport equations are transformed from the wave frame to the laboratory frame and the electrical field terms rendered into electrical potential terms via the Poisson-Boltzmann equation, Debye length approximation and ionic Nernst Planck equation. The dimensionless emerging linearized electro-magnetic boundary value problem is solved using integral methods. The influence of Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity (characteristic electro-osmotic velocity), couple stress length parameter (measure of the polarity of the fluid), Hartmann magnetic number, and electro-osmotic parameter on axial velocity, volumetric flow rate, time-averaged flow rate and streamline distribution are visualized and interpreted at length.

Further, presence of berberine was confirmed by {ESI}-{MS} spectra with protonated molecular ions ([M + H](+)) at m/z 336. Furthermore, {MS}-{MS} fragmentation pattern confirmed for the presence of berberine in both the samples. Both the spectra (standard and samples) showed common peaks for berberine in the form of protonated molecular ions ([M + H](+)) at m/z 320, m/z 304, m/z 292, m/z 278 in {MS}/{MS} mode. The study revealed that developed protocol is potent for rapid mass propagation of this plant species with high accumulation of important secondary metabolite berberine.},

	abstract = {Old engines (Euro {III} or earlier) produce more emissions, and it will be difficult to entirely stop their usage especially in developing and under-developed nations; hence, it is desired that appropriate emission reduction technologies are tested on such engines to analyze their feasibility and economical acceptability. While most such studies have been conducted on constant speed stationary engines and modern engines, this study tried to analyze the effectiveness of an uncoated wall-flow type ceramic diesel particulate filter on a Euro-I, water-cooled, direct injection, variable speed, compression ignition engine in a laboratory set-up in India. Also, this study focused on diesel particulate filter regeneration by two methods: active regeneration by diesel injection in the particulate filter using an electronic control unit and off-board regeneration by taking out and heating the diesel particulate filter in an electrical resistance furnace at 650 A degrees C for 10 h. The results, in the form of smoke emission, {NOx} emission and engine performance, obtained using both the regeneration methods were analyzed, and conclusions were drawn. It was found that using diesel particulate filter, particulate matter emissions (smoke) were almost entirely eliminated. It was also found that off-board regeneration had numerous advantages compared to active regeneration. Since a furnace would be needed for off-board regeneration, an exchange process for diesel particulate filter is suggested.},

	abstract = {Telavancin ({TD}-6424), a semisynthetic lipoglycopeptide vancomycin-derivative, is a novel antimicrobial agent developed by Theravance for overcoming resistant Gram-positive bacterial infections, specifically methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ({MRSA}). The {US} Food and Drug Administration ({USFDA}) had approved telavancin in 2009 for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections ({cSSSIs}) caused by Gram-positive bacteria, including {MRSA} (S. aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus anginosus group, or Enterococcus faecalis). Telavancin has two proposed mechanisms of action. In vitro, telavancin has a rapid, concentration-dependent bactericidal effect, due to disruption of cell membrane integrity. Telavancin has demonstrable in vitro activity against aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria. Telavancin and vancomycin have similar spectra of activity. Gram-negative bacteria are usually non-susceptible to telavancin. Telavancin has been successfully tested in various animal models of bacteremia, endocarditis, meningitis, and pneumonia. Phase {II} Telavancin versus Standard Therapy for Treatment of Complicated Skin and Soft-Tissue Infections due to Gram-Positive Bacteria ({FAST} 1 and {FAST} 2) and phase {III} [Assessment of Telavancin in Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections 1 ({ATLAS} 1 and {ATLAS} 2)] clinical trials have been conducted for evaluating telavancin s efficacy and safety in {cSSSIs}. Phase {III} clinical trials have been carried out for evaluating telavancin s safety and efficacy in nosocomial pneumonia [Assessment of Telavancin for Treatment of Hospital acquired Pneumonia 1 and 2 ({ATTAIN} 1 and {ATTAIN} 2)]. A phase {II} randomized, double-blind, clinical trial has been carried out for evaluating telavancin s safety and efficacy in uncomplicated S. aureus bacteremia [Telavancin for Treatment of Uncomplicated S. aureus Bacteremia ({ASSURE})]. Pacemaker lead-related infective endocarditis due to a vancomycin intermediate S. aureus ({VISA}) strain (non-daptomycin susceptible) was successfully treated with parenteral telavancin for 8 weeks. Telavancin extensively binds to serum albumin (similar to 93\%) and has a relatively small volume of distribution. Telavancin is not biotransformed by any cytochrome P450 microsomal enzymes and excreted mainly in the urine. Though well-tolerated, worrisome adverse effects, including renal dysfunction and {QTc} prolongation are of potential concern. Given its extensive binding to plasma proteins, long half-life, and a long post-antibiotic effect, it represents a promising addition to the therapeutic armamentarium in combating infections caused by resistant Gram-positive pathogens, namely, {MRSA}.},

For this, a Co layer of-10 nm thickness was deposited on the substrates and then oxidized in-situ to form {CoO}/Co/{PS} in-situ oxidized film or ex-situ in ambiance which also gives {CoO}/Co/{PS} naturally oxidized film. Simultaneously, reference thin films of Co (-10 rim) were also prepared on plane Si substrate and similar oxidation treatments were performed on them respectively. The magnetic properties studied using {SQUID} technique revealed higher exchange bias (1736 Oe) in the in-situ oxidized Co/{PS} film as compared to that in naturally oxidized Co/{PS} film (-1544 Oe) and also compared to the reference film.

The effects of nanoparticle shapes on effective thermal conductivity, axial velocity, transverse velocity, temperature, and pressure difference distributions along the length of non-uniform channel with variation of different flow parameters are discussed with the help of graphical illustrations. It is observed that platelet shaped nanoparticles carry maximum velocity whereas brick shaped nanoparticles are the best to enhance the thermal conductivity.

The Jefferys  non-Newtonian constitutive model is employed to characterize rheological properties of the fluid. The unsteady conservation equations for mass and momentum with electro-kinetic and Darcian porous medium drag force terms are reduced to a system of steady linearized conservation equations in an axisymmetric coordinate system. The long wavelength, creeping (low Reynolds number) and Debye-Hiickel linearization approximations are utilized. The resulting boundary value problem is shown to be controlled by a number of parameters including the electro-osmotic parameter, Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity (maximum electro-osmotic velocity), and Jefferys  first parameter (ratio of relaxation and retardation time), wave amplitude. The influence of these parameters and also time on axial velocity, pressure difference, maximum volumetric flow rate and streamline distributions (for elucidating trapping phenomena) is visualized graphically and interpreted in detail. Pressure difference magnitudes are enhanced consistently with both increasing electro-osmotic parameter and Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity, whereas they are only elevated with increasing Jefferys  first parameter for positive volumetric flow rates. Maximum time averaged flow rate is enhanced with increasing electro-osmotic parameter, Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity and Jefferys  first parameter. Axial flow is accelerated in the core (plug) region of the conduit with greater values of electro-osmotic parameter and Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity whereas it is significantly decelerated with increasing Jefferys  first parameter.

The test results show that micro capacity (4.4 {kW}), stationary, single cylinder, diesel engine can be successfully utilized to simultaneously produce power as well as heating, and to also store thermal energy. Slight decrease in engine performance was observed when double pipe heat exchanger and latent heat thermal energy storage system was integrated with engine but the amount of energy which could be recovered was significant. Maximum percentage of energy saved was obtained at a load of 3.6 {kW} and was 15.2\%. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
