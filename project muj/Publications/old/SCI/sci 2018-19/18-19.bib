Bentonite nanoclay ({NC}) was incorporated into the bio-polyol mixture as nano-reinforcement, while, triethyl phosphate was used as flame-retardant agent. After fabrication, these bioengineered foam nano-composites were studied for microstructural, mechanical and thermal characterizations. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis indicated the presence of characteristic functionalities within biopolyol segments, which was influenced by reactant activity within the polyurethane ({PU}) foams. Scanning electron microscopy revealed the cellular morphology of the foam. Thermogravimetric analysis enabled the study of foam decomposition behavior for different sample compositions. Incorporation of {NC} into pristine foam was found to delay the onset degradation temperature. Flammability studies depicted significant enhancement of flame retardancy with incorporation of {NC} up to a certain loading level. Compression tests demonstrated that significant improvement of compressive strength properties of foams could be achieved by incorporating bentonite nanoclay, owing to nucleation effect of nanoclay and corresponding enhanced structural integrity.

	abstract = {A large number of mechanism were anticipated for copper since 1988 in {NaCl} medium. The detail electrochemical behavior leading to the anodic dissolution of copper, however, still remains uncertain. Herein, an Imidazopyrimidine Dye, named, 4-amino-3-(phenyldiazenyl)benzo [4,5] imidazo [1,2-a] pyrimidin-2(1H)-one, ({APIP}) has been used as a copper corrosion inhibitor in 3.5 wt.\% (by weight) {NaCl} solution. The present investigation provides a brief mechanistic overview of the electrochemical mechanism of copper in aerated {NaCl} solution, simulating a static marine environment, with and without addition of {APIP} inhibitor. Potentiodynamic polarization ({PDP}) results confirmed that the {APIP} can suppress copper corrosion effectively at low concentration in 3.5 wt.\% {NaCl} solution with an inhibition efficiency of 92.79\% due to adsorption, along with the prediction of electrochemical mechanism. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy ({EIS}) measurements showed that the corrosion inhibition of Cu proceeds via both diffusion and kinetic controlled processes. Adsorption of {APIP} on copper surface is well fit with the Langmuir isotherm model and mode of adsorption is proposed. Antimicrobial activity was also studied and the result obtained showed “eco-friendly” nature of {APIP}. Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope ({FE}-{SEM}), Energy dispersion X-ray ({EDX}) and Attenuated Total Reflectance-Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy ({ATR}-{FTIR}) observations of the copper surfaces confirmed the existence of adsorption of {APIP} thus can be potentially used in industries in which seawater is implied are numerous such as cooling water systems, desalination plants, power plants, and oil production units. Results obtained from theoretical calculations including quantum chemical density functional theory ({DFT}) method and molecular dynamics ({MD}) simulations confirms the experimental findings and provide further insight into the mode of adsorption on the copper surface.},

Design/methodology/approach A case study approach was employed followed by interpretive structural modelling ({ISM}) to model the interrelationship among the {LIBs}. Findings This study reveals that lack of management commitment, leadership and resources are the key barriers to lean implementation in {SMEs} in India. Furthermore, poor communication between different levels of the organisation and inadequate dissemination of the knowledge of lean benefits also creates hindrance in lean implementation. Managerial implications of the identified barriers for lean implementation in {SMEs} have been discussed. Originality/value The research regarding lean implementation in {SMEs} is scarce. This study is the first attempt of its kind to identify the lean barriers in a small industry setup through mathematical analysis.},

In this paper, speech abnormalities are quantified using acoustic parameters including Linear Predictive Cepstral Coefficients, Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients and spectral features in speech samples of 48 participants (24 with intellectual disability and 24 age-matched controls). A training dataset was created by extracting these features which was used for learning by various classifiers. The experiments show promising results where Support Vector Machine gives an accuracy of 98\%.

	abstract = {The addition of polymer to injection fluid increases the crude oil recovery by improved sweep efficiency. Although it is the most widely used method for chemical enhanced oil recovery ({CEOR}), limitations such as lower stability of the polymer under reservoir conditions hinder the efficiency of the process. In the current study, a novel nanoparticle assisted polymer flooding approach was carried out to overcome these limitations. To determine whether nanoparticles influence the displacement efficiency of the injected fluid, we used a blend of xanthan gum and nickel nanoparticles. We have evaluated the changes in the dilute solution viscosity of xanthan when the nickel nanoparticles are added and have found out that a xanthan-nickel nanoparticles mixture has a higher intrinsic viscosity of 55.25 {dL}/g compared to 49.13 {dL}/g for the gum solution. Efficiency of nanoparticle assisted polymer flooding was evaluated in sand packed bioreactors with similar to 0.6 {PV} of residual oil in place ({ROIP}). Flooding results demonstrated the highest recovery of 5.98\% of additional {ROIP} with xanthan-nickel nanoparticle mixture compared to 4.48 and 4.58\% of {ROIP} during the separate flooding of xanthan and nanoparticles, respectively. Results suggested the novel nanoparticle assisted polymer flooding approach is able to increase oil recovery beyond available methods.},

	abstract = {Electrokinetic peristaltic multi-layered transport is considered in a micro-channel under the action of an axial electrical field. Three different layers i.e. the core layer, intermediate layer and peripheral layer are simulated with three different viscosities for each fluid layer. The unsteady two-dimensional conservation equations for mass and momentum with electrokinetic body forces, are transformed from the wave frame to the laboratory frame and the electrical field terms are rendered into electrical potential terms via the Poisson-Boltzmann equation, Debye length approximation and ionic Nernst-Planck equation. The dimensionless emerging linearized electrokinetic boundary value problem is solved using integral methods. Closed-form expressions are derived for stream functions in the core, intermediate and peripheral layers. Expressions are also derived for the core-intermediate interface shape and the intermediate-peripheral interface shape. Maximum pressures are also computed. To study bolus migration, the range of the trapping limit is also determined in the peripheral layer. It is found that in the core layer larger boluses are computed in the case of lower intermediate layer viscosity relative to peripheral layer viscosity although the number of boluses is greater when the intermediate layer viscosity exceeds the peripheral layer viscosity. Furthermore, in the intermediate layer, stronger concentration of streamlines is computed in the lower half space with positive Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity. Also negative Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity reduces the core layer (H-1) interface shape whereas it enhances the peripheral layer (H) and intermediate layer (H-2) shapes. At lower values of volume flow rate ratio, hydromechanical efficiency is maximum for positive Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity whether intermediate layer viscosity is less or greater than peripheral layer viscosity. Finally, greater with greater peristaltic wave amplitude and also for positive Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity there is an increase in time-averaged flow rate, whether intermediate layer viscosity is less or greater than peripheral layer viscosity.

	abstract = {Automated segmentation and dermoscopic hair detection are one of the significant challenges in computer-aided diagnosis ({CAD}) of melanocytic lesions. Additionally, due to the presence of artifacts and variation in skin texture and smooth lesion boundaries, the accuracy of such methods gets hampered. The objective of this research is to develop an automated hair detection and lesion segmentation algorithm using lesion-specific properties to improve the accuracy. The aforementioned objective is achieved in two ways. Firstly, a novel hair detection algorithm is designed by considering the properties of dermoscopic hair. Second, a novel chroma-based geometric deformable model is used to effectively differentiate the lesion from the surrounding skin. The speed function incorporates the chrominance properties of the lesion to stop evolution at the lesion boundary. Automatic initialization of the initial contour and chrominance-based speed function aids in providing robust and flexible segmentation. The proposed approach is tested on 200 images from {PH}2 and 900 images from {ISBI} 2016 datasets. Average accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and overlap scores of 93.4, 87.6, 95.3, and 11.52\% respectively are obtained for the {PH}2 dataset. Similarly, the proposed method resulted in average accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and overlap scores of 94.6, 82.4, 97.2, and 7.20\% respectively for the {ISBI} 2016 dataset.

The similar shape character has a very minute difference, which is called critical region and used to discriminate them by human beings. The primary goal of the current work is to identify the critical region of the similar character and use the same to generate additional features in order to minimize the classification errors in the end results. It is also quite challenging to identify the critical region as the characters are written in different handwriting styles and fonts. The paper suggestes the Fisher linear discriminant model to detect the critical region, which is used to extract the additional feature.

We used molecular dynamics simulations to reveal the importance of the physicochemical properties of ceftazidime in modulating the translocation through {OccK}8, proposing a structure-function relationship.

Firstly, the governing flow problem is described by continuity and momentum equations in the presence of electrokinetic forces in Cartesian coordinates, then long wavelength and low/zero Reynolds (neglecting the inertial forces) approximations are applied to modify the governing flow problem. The resulting differential equations are solved analytically in order to obtain exact solutions for velocity profile whereas the numerical integration is carried out to analyze the pumping characteristics. The physical behaviour of sundry parameters is discussed for velocity profile, pressure rise and volume flow rate. In particular, the behaviour of electro-osmotic parameter, phase difference, and Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity is examined and discussed. The trapping mechanism is also visualized by drawing streamlines against the governing parameters. The present study offers various interesting results that warrant further study on electrokinetic transport with peristalsis.},

An integrated approach has been used to incorporate ultrafine fluorcanasite ({FC}) glass-ceramic particulates within nanocellulose matrix, synthesized from lignocellulosic biomass. Epichlorohydrin ({ECH}) was used as a chemical cross-linking agent for hydrogel synthesis. The compositions and properties of bio-nanocomposite hydrogels were controlled by varying the loading of {FC} and {ECH}. Moreover, microstructural characterizations and functional group analysis of synthesized nanocellulose and bio-nanocomposite hydrogels were carried out using scanning electron microscopy ({SEM}) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ({FT}-{IR}). {SEM} studies revealed successful extraction of cellulosic nanofibres and interconnected porous micro-architecture of injectable hydrogels. Incorporation of {FC} particulates resulted into development of well-defined micro-porous morphology. {FT}-{IR} studies indicated the presence of hydroxyl groups and possible interactions between nanocellulose and {FC} reinforcements. The rheological study of the developed injectable hydrogel was carried out at different frequency, amplitude and temperature sweeps. The studies revealed that after the incorporation of {FC}, dynamic storage modulus increased, while synergistically enhancing the injectability of the bio-nanocomposite hydrogels. An optimum loading level of {FC} reinforcement could also be established. Swelling behaviour studies of the hydrogels demonstrated higher degree of swelling and enhanced structural integrity with incorporation of {FC}. The novel bio-nanocomposite injectable hydrogels developed in this study, could demonstrate promising potential as injectable implant material. [{GRAPHICS}] .},

	abstract = {Electrokinetic transport of fluids through microchannels by micro-pumping and micro-peristaltic pumping has stimulated considerable interest in biomedical engineering and other areas of medical technology. Deeper elucidation of the fluid dynamics of such transport requires the continuous need for more elegant mathematical models and numerical simulations, in parallel with laboratory investigations. In this article we therefore investigate analytically the unsteady viscous flow driven by the combined effects of peristalsis and electro-osmosis through microchannel. An integral number of waves propagating in the microchannel are considered as a model for transportation of fluid bolus along the channel length. Debye-Hiickel linearization is employed to evaluate the potential function. Low Reynolds number and large wavelength approximations are employed. Closed-form solutions are derived for the non-dimensional boundary value problem. The computations demonstrate that magnitude of electric potential function is increased with a decrease in the thickness of the electrical double layer ({EDL}). Stronger electric field also decelerates the flow and decreases local wall shear stress. Hydrodynamic pressure is increased with {EDL} thickness whereas it is suppressed with electric field. Streamline visualization reveals that the quantity of trapped bolus is decreased with increase in {EDL} thickness and also with higher external electric field.

	abstract = {To sustain the adequate bandwidth demands over rapidly growing multimedia traffic and considering the effectiveness of Information-Centric Networking ({ICN}), recently, {HTTP} based Dynamic Adaptive Streaming ({DASH}) has been introduced over {ICN}, which significantly increases the network bandwidth utilisation. However, we identified that the inherent features of {ICN} also causes new vulnerabilities in the network. In this paper, we first propose a novel attack called as Bitrate Oscillation Attack ({BOA}), which exploits fundamental {ICN} characteristics: in-network caching and interest aggregation, to disrupt {DASH} functionality. In particular, the proposed attack forces the bitrate and resolution of video received by the attacked client to oscillate with high frequency and high amplitude during the streaming process. To detect and mitigate {BOA}, we design and implement a reactive countermeasure called Fair-{RTT}-{DAS}. Our solution ensures efficient bandwidth utilisation and improves the user perceived Quality of Experience ({QoE}) in the presence of varying content source locations. For this purpose, Fair-{RTT}-{DAS} consider {DASH} s two significant features: round-trip-time ({RTT}) and throughput fairness. In the presence of {BOA} in a network, our simulation results show an increase in the annoyance factor in user s spatial dimension, i.e., increase in oscillation frequency and amplitude. The results also show that our countermeasure significantly alleviates these adverse effects and makes dynamic adaptive streaming friendly to {ICN} s implicit features.},

We report a simple, sensitive and specific nano-technology based `Nano-immuno test  capable of detecting viable {MAP} bacilli in the milk samples within 10 h. Viable {MAP} bacilli were captured by {MAP} specific antibody-conjugated magnetic nano-particles using resazurin dye as chromogen. Test was optimized using true culture positive (10-bovine and 12-goats) and true culture negative (16-bovine and 25-goats) raw milk samples. Domestic livestock species in India are endemically infected with {MAP}. After successful optimization, sensitivity and specificity of the `nano-immuno test  in goats with respect to milk culture was 91.7\% and 96.0\%, respectively. Whereas, it was 90.0\% (sensitivity) and 92.6\% (specificity) with respect to {IS}900 {PCR}. In bovine milk samples, sensitivity and specificity of `nano-immuno test  with respect to milk culture was 90.0\% and 93.7\%, respectively. However, with respect to {IS}900 {PCR}, the sensitivity and specificity was 88.9\% and 94.1\%, respectively. Test was validated with field raw milk samples (goats-258 and bovine-138) collected from domestic livestock species to detect live/viable {MAP} bacilli. Of 138 bovine raw milk samples screened by six diagnostic tests, 81 (58.7\%) milk samples were positive for {MAP} infection in one or more than one diagnostic tests. Of 81 (58.7\%) positive bovine raw milk samples, only 24 (17.4\%) samples were detected positive for the presence of viable {MAP} bacilli. Of 258 goats raw milk samples screened by six diagnostic tests, 141 (54.6\%) were positive for {MAP} infection in one or more than one test.

Simplicity and efficiency of this novel `nano-immuno test  makes it suitable for wide-scale screening of milk samples in the field. Standardization, validation and re-usability of functionalized nano-particles and the test was successfully achieved in field samples. Test was highly specific, simple to perform and easy to read by naked eyes and does not require laboratory support in the performance of test.

A magnetic body force is incorporated for the influence of static radial magnetic field. The mass and momentum conservation equations are formulated in an intrinsic coordinate system and transformed with appropriate variables into a nondimensional system between the wave and the laboratory frames, under lubrication (i.e., low Reynolds number and long wavelength) approximations. Kinematic and no-slip boundary conditions are imposed at the channel walls. A magnetic body force is incorporated for the influence of static radial magnetic field in the primary momentum equation. An analytic approach is employed to determine closed-form solutions for stream function, axial pressure gradient, and volumetric flow rate. Spatiotemporal plots for pressure distribution along the channel (passage) length are presented to study the influences of curvature parameter, relaxation-to-retardation time ratio (Jeffrey first viscoelastic parameter) and Hartmann number (magnetic field parameter). The effects of these parameters on radial velocity distributions are also visualized. Cases of trapping and reflux in a curved channel are discussed. Streamline distributions are included to study trapping phenomena and to investigate more closely the impact of curvature, magnetic field, and viscoelastic properties on bolus evolution.

	doi = {10.1016/j.jtbi.2018.03.009},
	abstract = {In vivo studies suggest that cyclic and low-magnitude loading can be useful over pharmaceutical drugs in normalizing bone loss as it encourages osteogenesis (i.e. new bone formation) at the sites of elevated strain magnitude. In silico models assumed normal strain or strain energy density ({SED}) as the stimulus to predict loading-induced osteogenesis, however, these models may have limited success in fitting the in vivo new bone formation at several instances. For example, rest-inserted cyclic loading amplifies the new bone formation as compared to continuous-cyclic loading even though similar strain magnitude were induced in both the cases. It is also believed that loading-induced interstitial fluid flow can also be a potential stimulus of osteogenesis. The present study hypothesizes that fluid motion as osteogenic stimulus may explain the afore-mentioned anomalies. Accordingly, this work studies osteogenesis as functions of {SED} and canalicular fluid motion using an in silico model. Therefore, the new bone formation is considered roughly proportional to stimuli above their osteogenic thresholds. This model attempts to simulate in vivo new bone formation noticed in rest-inserted cantilever loading studies. The model s prediction of site-specific new bone formation improves when fluid flow is considered as the stimulus. It is also noticed that fluid motion as the stimulus closely fits the new bone formation for another in vivo study where the effects of aging on osteogenesis were examined. These attempts to establish fluid flow as a potential osteogenic stimulus can be useful in the prediction of site-specific new bone formation. The findings will ultimately be useful in designing biomechanical interventions such as prophylactic exercises to cure bone loss. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Misalignments in gears cause vibrations and contact nonlinearities, which in turn cause load distribution shift on the gear tooth. The load distribution shift of the gear pair results in increased contact and bending stresses with the maximum stresses leaning towards the edge of the face width. These stress changes cause failures and gear performance variations, such as pitting, scuffing, crack initiation and eventually tooth breakage. In this paper, the contact and bending stresses of a misaligned spur gear pair were evaluated with and without friction by employing corresponding analytical methods and finite element method ({FEM}). Friction coefficient values of 0.1 to 0.3 were used to evaluate the effects of friction on contact and bending stress distribution of a spur gear pair with axial and angular misalignments. The stress concentration was found to be higher at the contact point and at the tooth root of the gear with the augmentation of the misalignment distance and angle. The maximum contact and bending stresses increased by 67.5\% and 18.9\%, respectively, when axial misalignments were subjected. Similarly, the maximum contact and bending stresses increased by 27.0\% and 62.4\%, respectively, for angular misalignments. Furthermore, the contact and bending stresses increased proportionally with the increasing coefficient of friction. Finally, the relationships between the normalized stress and misalignments (both axial and angular) were established.},

	abstract = {Cyclic and low-magnitude loading is considered effective in arresting the bone loss as it promotes osteogenesis (i.e. new bone formation) at the sites of elevated normal strain magnitude. In silico models assumed normal strain as the stimulus to predict the sites of new bone formation. These models, however, may fail to fit the amount of newly formed bone. Loading parameters such as strain, frequency, and loading cycle decide the amount of new bone formation. The models did not incorporate this information. In fact, there is no unifying relationship to quantify the amount of new bone formation as a function of loading parameters. Therefore, the present work aims to establish an empirical relationship between loading parameters and a new bone formation parameter i.e. mineral apposition rate ({MAR}). A neural network model is used to serve the purpose. Loading parameters are supplied as input, whereas, {MAR} served as output. The model is trained and tested with experimental data. The model establishes an empirical relationship to estimate {MAR} as a function of loading parameters. The model s predictions of {MAR} align with in vivo experimental results. The model s response is analyzed which indicates that the bone adaptation characteristics are successfully captured in the relationship. The relationship established may be incorporated further to improve qualitative and quantitative prediction capabilities of computer models.

It has a wide range of culinary applications and has bioremediation, nutritional and medicinal properties. Conventionally, seeds of the tree have been used as natural coagulants and flocculents in waste water treatment. Its leaves and bark act as biosorbent for remediation of heavy metals and dyes. The tree provides remedies for a range of diseases and disorders by dint of its unique combination of numerous phytochemicals. Gum exudates of the tree are of immense medicinal importance due to their applications in biodegradable drug delivery systems and in treatment of asthma, dysentery and intestinal cancer. The multidimensional utilities of M. oleifera may cause overexploitation of this tree, posing danger to the existing natural variability in the near future. Therefore, there is a need for conservation of the species for ethnobotanical, pharmacological, nutraceutical and biodiversity purposes. Development of tissue culture propagation methods will assist in preserving some of the germplasm of the species.
