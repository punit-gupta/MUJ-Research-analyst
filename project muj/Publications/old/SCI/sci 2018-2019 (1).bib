Abstract = {{In this article, we have investigated the influence of
   magneto-hydro-dynamic (MHD) Powell-Eyring fluid flow in the presence of
   non-linear radiation, space dependent internal heat source and variable
   thermal conductivity over a permeable cylinder with suction/injection
   effects. We have considered Soret, Dufour and non-linear chemical
   reaction effect on heat and concentration equations. Using similarly
   transformation, the governing PDEs are changed into non-linear coupled
   ODEs and solved by R-K forth order with shooting method. The impact of
   various parameters such as Powell-Eyring fluid parameters (K), Dufour
   parameter (Du), radiation parameter (R), small scale parameter
   (epsilon), Prandtl number (Pr), curvature parameter (gamma), Schmidt
   number (Sc), chemical reaction parameter (Kn), Eckert number (Ec),
   relative temperature ratio parameter (theta(w)), Soret parameter (Su),
   magnetic field parameter (M) and (A{*}) and (B{*}) are specific and
   temperature heat source on axial momentum, heat and concentration
   profiles have been analyzed graphically and skin friction coefficient,
   local Nusselt number and local Sherwood number can be discussed

Abstract = {{Electro-osmotic peristaltic transport of aqueous nanofluids in a
   two-dimensional micro-channel is examined analytically. Such flows arise
   in bio-mimetic pumping systems at the very small scale of interest in
   physiological treatment e.g. occular drug delivery systems. Complex
   waveforms are imposed at the walls to mimic sophisticated peristaltic
   wave propagation scenarios. Nano-particles are assumed to be in local
   thermal equilibrium. Joule electro-thermal heating is included. The
   dimensional conservation equations are linearized and transformed from
   the wave to the fixed (laboratory) frame under lubrication theory
   approximations. The emerging dimensionless model features a number of
   important thermo-physical, electrical and nanoscale parameter, namely
   thermal and solutal (basic density) Grashof numbers, nanoscale Brownian
   motion parameter, thermophoresis parameter, Helmholtz-Smoluchowski
   velocity (maximum electro-osmotic velocity), Debye electrokinetic length
   and Joule heating to surface heat flux ratio. Closed-form solutions are
   derived for the nano-particle volume fraction, temperature, axial
   velocity, averaged volumetric flow rate, pressure difference across one
   wavelength, skin friction (wall shear stress function), Nusselt number
   (wall heat transfer rate) and stream function distribution in the wave
   frame. The influence of selected parameters on these flow variables is
   studied with the aid of graphs. Bolus formation is also visualized and
   streamline distributions are observed to be strongly influenced and
   asymmetric in nature. (C) 2017 The Society of Powder Technology Japan.

Abstract = {{Metal-halide perovskites are rapidly emerging crystalline materials that
   are reasonably preferred as leading aspirant for applications in
   optoelectronic and thermoelectric devices. In this paper, we have
   thoroughly reviewed and performed calculations to reveal optoelectronic
   and transport properties for a potential newcomer, Cs2PdX6 (X = Cl, Br)
   termed as Cesium Palladium Halides (CPH). Outcome of present
   computations are compared with available results and a reasonable
   agreement is recorded. Energy band gap computations performed reveal
   indirect band gap of 2.29 eV for Cs2PdC16, which substantially reduces
   to 1.22 eV when `Cl' is replaced by `Br'. Optical absorption spectra
   investigations performed here, in the energy range from 3 to 5 eV
   confirms effective utilization of these compounds in solar cells and
   other optoelectronic applications. In addition, the transport properties
   computations performed using semi-classical Boltzmann theory, shows
   constant pattern of thereto power near ambient temperature range
   (200-500 K), which admits possible utilization of these compounds as low
   temperature thermoelectric materials. Performed ZT calculations
   demonstrates reasonably good thermoelectric performance for both
   materials, as there exist minor variation (0.1) in the values over wide
   temperature ranges i.e. from 100 to 800 K. Further, detailed analysis of
   transport properties predicts p-type semiconducting nature of the
   present series of materials.}},

Abstract = {{Oxime-modified aluminium(III) isopropoxide,
   {[}Al(O(l)1Pr)(ONC(CH3)(2)\}(2)] was used as a sol-gel precursor to
   deposit alumina film on steel substrate by dip coating method. The
   thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the above compound indicates its
   clean one step decomposition to alumina at low temperature, making it a
   suitable spray pyrolysis deposition (SPD) precursor for deposition of
   alumina film over steel at 400 degrees C. The formed alumina films (dip
   and spray coated) were characterized by Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron
   Microscopy (SEM) and Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopic (EDX)
   techniques. The XRD patterns of the films suggest deposition of
   amorphous alumina films while the MIR and EDX analyses indicate the
   presence of alumina film on steel substrate. SEM images of coated
   samples indicate deposition of crack-free alumina films. The thickness
   of alumina films (dip and spray coated) were found to be in the range of
   similar to 1.4 +/- 0.2 mu m as indicated by their cross sectional views.
   The corrosion protection of the deposited alumina films has been checked
   by the electrochemical studies; open circuit potential (OCP),
   electro-chemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and potentiodynamic
   polarization. The electrochemical studies suggest corrosion resistive
   nature of the alumina film in 15\% (w/v) NaCl solution.}},

Abstract = {{A compact dual band-notched Ultra-wideband (UWB) circular monopole

   and 7.8 to 8.4 GHz for ITU band respectively. By cutting a rectangular
   slot on the ground plane, additional resonance is excited at the higher
   frequency band, and hence much wider impedance bandwidth can be
   attained. Applications of the proposed dual band-notched ultra-wideband
   (UWB) antenna structure with 5.2 GHz and 8.2 GHz center frequencies are
   demonstrated experimentally. Measured and simulated results of the

Abstract = {{This study showcases the potential of unnatural amino acids to enable
   non-natural functions when incorporated in the protein scaffold of heme
   metalloproteins. For this purpose, a genetically-engineered myoglobin
   (Mb) mutant was created by incorporating redox-active 3-amino-L-tyrosine
   (NH(2)Tyr) into its active site, replacing the distal histidine (H64)
   with NH(2)Tyr. In peroxide-shunt assays, this variant exhibits an
   increased rate of turnover for thioanisole and benzaldehyde oxidation as
   compared to the wild-type (WT) Mb. Indeed, in the presence of excess
   hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a 9-fold and 81-fold increase in activity was
   observed over multiple turnovers for thioanisole sulfoxidation and
   benzoic acid formation, respectively. The increased oxidation activity
   in the H64NH(2)Tyr Mb mutant underlined the role of NH(2)Tyr in the
   distal active-site scaffold in peroxide activation. Kinetic,
   electrochemical, and EPR spectroscopic experiments were performed. On
   the basis of these studies, it is argued that the single NH(2)Tyr
   residue within the Mb variant simultaneously serves the role of the
   conserved His/Arg-pair within the distal pocket of horseradish
   peroxidase.}},

Abstract = {{Three dyes based on a triphenylamine (TPA) moiety using a silicon bridge

   benefits of long alkyl chains and electron donor group on photo
   conversion efficiency (PCE) of dye sensitized solar cells is discussed.
   A previously synthesised dye, denoted CL-1, which contained long alkyl
   chains and exhibited an efficiency of 6.90\%, was compared with CL-SiMe,
   which contained shorter alkyl chains and showed and efficiency of
   3.41\%. A large drop in J(sc) and V-oc was found to be the reason for
   the appreciable decline in efficiency for CL-SiMe vis-a-vis CL-1.
   Electron donor group studies were performed using CL-1D and CL-OMe.
   CL-1D, which contained bulky aniline electron donor groups, showed an
   efficiency of 4.20\%, whilst CL-OMe, featuring smaller methoxy donor
   groups had an efficiency of 5.50\%. Theoretical UV-Vis absorption
   spectra were obtained for the CL-1D dye by time-dependent density

   economy has grown at an enormous rate, and it is now worth about 150
   billions of dollars. This exponential growth in the market value of
   bitcoins motivate adversaries to exploit weaknesses for profit, and
   researchers to discover new vulnerabilities in the system, propose
   countermeasures, and predict upcoming trends. In this paper, we present
   a systematic survey that covers the security and privacy aspects of
   Bitcoin. We start by giving an overview of the Bitcoin system and its
   major components along with their functionality and interactions within
   the system. We review the existing vulnerabilities in Bitcoin and its
   major underlying technologies such as blockchain and PoW-based consensus
   protocol. These vulnerabilities lead to the execution of various
   security threats to the standard functionality of Bitcoin. We then
   investigate the feasibility and robustness of the state-of-the-art
   security solutions. Additionally, we discuss the current anonymity
   considerations in Bitcoin and the privacy-related threats to Bitcoin
   users along with the analysis of the existing privacy-preserving
   solutions. Finally, we summarize the critical open challenges, and we
   suggest directions for future research towards provisioning stringent
   security and privacy solutions for Bitcoin.}},

Abstract = {{It is the intention of this work to develop a system which specialized
   in processing scanned images. This paper focuses on developing an
   extended partitioning approach for partial fingerprint identification.
   The procedure has utilized image orientation, enhancement,
   extended-partitioning, binarization and feature extraction. The major
   focus of this work is to reduce error rates during match. The proposed
   approach performs partitioning on images to create extended sub-parts
   before matching. This procedure clinically extracts the information of
   sub-parts and establishes a lower bound on the performance. The extended
   partition-based representation combines both the global and the local
   information present in a fingerprint Test results have presented that
   the proposed method has a discriminatory power compared to other
   representations. Finally, it has shown that the use of all the
   techniques presented in this work significantly improves error rates of
   a partial fingerprint identification system on a large database.}},

Abstract = {{Even though finding out distance is the central core of k-Nearest

   Most of the similarity measures, which are used to classify an instance,

   increases in the number of dimensions. This paper establishes an
   efficient technique called ARSkNN for finding out class of any given
   instance using a measure based on an unique similarity, that does no
   longer compute distance, for k-NN classification. Our empirical results
   show that ARSkNN classification technique is better than the previous
   established k-NN classifiers. The performance of algorithm was verified

Journal = {{COMPUTING AND INFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{311-326}},
Abstract = {{Concurrent workflow scheduling algorithm works in three phases, namely
   rank computation, tasks selection, and resource selection. In this
   paper, we introduce a new ranking algorithm that computes the rank of a
   task, based on its successor rank and its predecessors average
   communication time, instead of its successors rank. The advantage of
   this ranking algorithm is that two dependent tasks are assigned to the
   same machine and as a result the scheduled length is reduced. The task
   selection phase selects a ready task from each workflow and creates a
   task pool. The resource selection phase initially assigns tasks using
   min-min heuristic, after initial assignment, tasks are moved from the
   highly loaded machines to the lightly loaded machines. Our resource
   selection algorithm increases the load balance among the resources due
   to tasks assignment heuristic and reassignment of tasks from the highly
   loaded machines. The simulation results show that our proposed
   scheduling algorithm performs better over existing approaches in terms
   of load balance, makespan and turnaround time.}},

   that at room temperature, Young's modulus of DGEBA-DETDA composite is
   2.429 GPa while after reinforcement of CNT, Young's modulus increased to

Abstract = {{This article analyzes the effect of abnormal environmental conditions on
   various reliability measures. After the continuous operation of
   single-unit systems for a long duration of time these systems cannot be
   restored again in a younger state after the failure of the system. The
   unit does not remain as new after repair. This phenomenon is known as
   degradation and the unit after repair is called degraded unit.
   Preventive maintenance is a proactive method to tackle and overcome from
   these types of problems. For this purpose, a stochastic model is
   developed for single-unit systems by using semi-Markov process. There is
   a single server who inspects the failed unit after failed to check the
   feasibility of repair and replacement. If repair is not feasible then
   unit is replaced with some replacement time. The failed unit after
   repair becomes degraded and degraded failed unit is replaced by new one.
   All time distributions are arbitrary distributed like Weibull
   distribution with common shape parameter and different scale parameters.
   The switching devices are instantaneous. The system is observed at
   suitable regenerative epochs to obtain various measures of system
   effectiveness of interest to system designers and operation managers.}},

Abstract = {{The flow characteristics of nanofluids flow driven by combined effects
   of electroosmosis and peristalsis are very important for designing
   bio-mimetic pumping systems at the micro scale of interest in
   physiological treatment e.g. ocular drug delivery systems. The flow
   characteristics of thermally developed nanofluids flow are investigated
   in presence of peristalsis and electroosmosis phenomena. Thermal
   radiation effect is also introduced. Tapered asymmetric microchannels
   are imposed at the walls to mimic sophisticated peristaltic wave
   propagation scenarios. The nanofluid is employed as the worldng fluid,
   and the analytical solution for electro-osmotic flow is obtained by
   virtue of the Debye-Huckel linearization. The dimensional conservation
   equations are linearized under lubrication theory approximations. The
   effects of emerging physical parameters namely Grashof numbers, Brownian
   motion parameter, thermophoresis parameter, Helmholtz-Smoluchowski
   velocity, Debye length and thermal radiation on flow characteristics,
   heat transfer characteristics, and pumping characteristics are computed.
   Furthermore, an inherent phenomenon of peristaltic pumping known as
   trapping is also presented graphically under the influence of pertinent
   parameters and discussed in brief. Validation of present model is also
   presented. This model is mainly applicable to study cell responses,
   blood analysis, biomimetic capillary designs, and blood vessel tissue
   culture systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Second law analysis in three-dimensional MHD boundary layer flow and
   heat transfer of a rotating Casson fluid over a stretching surface has
   been investigated. Such flow problems have relevance in extraction and
   manufacturing of rubber and polymer sheets. Solution of these problems
   is of great interest as they serve a practical purpose. Partial
   differential equations governing flow and heat transfer have been
   transformed into non-linear ordinary differential equations by using
   suitable similarity transformations. These non-linear differential
   equations have been solved numerically by using shooting techniques with
   fourth order Runge-Kutta method. Effects of Casson fluid parameter beta,
   rotation parameter lambda, Prandtl number Pr and magnetic field
   parameter M on velocity profile, temperature profile and skin friction
   number have been analyzed and depicted through graphs and tables.
   Entropy generation number and Bejan number have also been obtained and
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{A modified microbial polysaccharide based biopolymer has been
   investigated as a potential candidate towards development of sustainable
   biomaterials and bioplastics. An in-depth study was carried out to
   biosynthesize, characterize and assess any possible mutagenic potential
   and ecotoxicity of the microbial polysaccharide biopolymer.
   Microstructural investigations using confocal microscopy, Fourier
   transform (FT)-Raman depth profile mapping and scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM) of the biosynthetically modified polysaccharide
   revealed internal structural perturbations, as well as occlusion of
   granular pores by extraneous materials. The Raman 3D mapping depth
   profile along with time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry also
   indicated important structural and surface modifications, which could be
   correlated to the production of microbial exopolysaccharides and
   secondary metabolites. The study then looked into any possible genetic
   mutation and ecological risks associated with the biosynthetically
   modified polysaccharide through the investigation of genotoxicity and
   ecotoxicity. The genotoxicity study was carried out through bacterial
   reverse gene mutation (Ames) test by using two different strains (TA98
   and TA100) of bacteria. The results did not indicate any mutagenic
   effect against either of the strains used for the biopolymer samples and
   was found to be genotoxically safe. Ecotoxicity tests, carried out using
   bioluminescent bacteria Vibrio fisheri further indicated no ecotoxicity
   within the given experimental conditions. The study measured the half
   maximal effective concentration (EC50) to cause a 50\% decrease in the
   light output of the bacteria, a measure of ecotoxicological response of
   the biopolymer. Overall, results from this study indicated that the
   novel biopolymer was genotoxically and ecotoxically safe, which offers
   immense potential for future use of this biopolymer.}},

Abstract = {{Power system monitoring and control in real time is a challenging task
   for modern power system due to large operational constraints. The
   deployment of phasor measurement units (PMUs) at key locations provides
   an opportunity for devising effective power system monitoring and
   control measures. In this study, a new method is proposed to determine
   the real-time transient stability status and identification of the
   coherent generator groups by predicting the rotor angle values following
   a large disturbance through radial basis function neural network. The
   first six cycles of synchronously sampled post-fault data measurements
   from PMUs consisting of rotor angles and voltages of generators are
   taken as the input to the neural network to predict the future state of
   the system. The proposed method can also determine the synchronism state
   of the individual machine in real time. The proposed scheme is
   demonstrated on the IEEE-39 bus test system at different operating
   conditions.}},
