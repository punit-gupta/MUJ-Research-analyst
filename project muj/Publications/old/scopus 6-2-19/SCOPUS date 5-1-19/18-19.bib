abstract={A hexagonal monopole ultra wideband (UWB) antenna with reconfigurable band suspension functionality is experimentally studied in this paper. The proposed antenna is capable to switch its resonance from entire ultra wideband to single band notched ultra wideband applications using single p-i-n diode switch. The impedance bandwidth enhancement of the antenna is achieved by optimization of the hexagonal radiating patch and the ground plane. Single slot is inserted in hexagonal patch to embed the p-i-n diode. Simulated and measured results of return loss, E/H-field patterns and gain are obtained and good agreement is achieved. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper aims to acknowledge the combined power of Big Data, position, motion sensors present in an everyday mobile phone while defocusing the use of GPS, thus lessening the privacy concern. The commonness of mobile phones and their inexpensive MEMS (Micro Electro Mechanical Systems) is exploited in this paper to derive meaningful information. The GPS-denied environment enables the projection of accuracy of location tracking. The scope of this paper is public transport vehicles like buses, metros, shuttles, tubes, trains, airplanes. An experiment is conducted using multiple phones at different locations within the same vehicle. We collect the MEMS sensor readings of various phones within an area and subject them to preprocessing, storing, analyzing and real-time comparing with each other. The concept here is that the readings will be similar, especially at notable data points like turns or acceleration/decelerations. The huge amount of sensor readings from various phones implies dealing with Big Data. The data analysis method used in the paper does not require calibrating the phone sensors. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={In this research study, empirical mathematical models for cutting forces and surface roughness have been developed to investigate the effect of axial depth of cut, feed, radial depth of cut and cutting speed in high-speed ball-end milling of Al2014-T6. Ball-end milling experiments have been planned using central composite design based on response surface methodology. The mathematical models have been established and tested for adequacy. A full quadratic model has been adopted for modelling. It has been found that axial depth of cut is the most dominant cutting parameter for the tangential and axial cutting forces, accounting for 49.38 and 47.12% contributions, respectively. Radial depth of cut is the most dominant parameter for radial force and contributes 69.94% for it. Results also revealed that force components decrease with increase in cutting speed. There is very small variation in cutting force components in the cutting speed range of 75–150 m/min at lower values of axial and radial depth of cut. Surface roughness is effected by cutting speed largely followed by feed. Multi-objective optimization has been performed using composite desirability to optimize the cutting parameters for minimum surface roughness and cutting forces simultaneously. Confirmation tests have been conducted using optimal set of cutting parameters. The results of confirmation tests are very close to the predicted results. © 2017, The Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering.},

abstract={Here we report an in-silico approach for identification, characterization and validation of deleterious non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) in the interleukin-8 gene using three steps. In first step, sequence homology-based genetic analysis of a set of 50 coding SNPs associated with 41 rsIDs using SIFT (Sorting Intolerant from Tolerant) and PROVEAN (Protein Variation Effect Analyzer) identified 23 nsSNPs to be putatively damaging/deleterious in at least one of the two tools used. Subsequently, structure-homology based PolyPhen-2 (Polymorphism Phenotyping) analysis predicted 9 of 23 nsSNPs (K4T, E31A, E31K, S41Y, I55N, P59L, P59S, L70P and V88D) to be damaging. According to the conditional hypothesis for the study, only nsSNPs that score damaging/deleterious prediction in both sequence and structural homology-based approach will be considered as 'high-confidence' nsSNPs. In step 2, based on conservation of amino acid residues, stability analysis, structural superimposition, RSMD and docking analysis, the possible structural-functional relationship was ascertained for high-confidence nsSNPs. Finally, in a separate analysis (step 3), the IL-8 deregulation has also appeared to be an important prognostic marker for detection of patients with gastric and lung cancer. This study, for the first time, provided in-depth insights on the effects of amino acid substitutions on IL-8 protein structure, function and disease association. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={Designing of a type-II nanoscale heterostructure and simulating their optical properties is critical for many applications and remains a challenge. This paper reports designing of a complex type – II ‘W’ shaped symmetric InGaAsP/GaAsSb nano-scale heterostructure grown on InP substrate and mechanism of the transitions taking place within the heterostructure which are responsible for optical properties. In addition, the band alignment, optical gain and lasing wavelength are also studied under the effect of applied external electric field ranging from 10 to 200 kV/cm and variable temperature. On the basis of outcome of the calculations, the proposed heterostructure can be claimed to show a very high optical gain (∼8000/cm) within the MIR (mid infrared) region. Moreover, the results achieved in the study suggest that the application of the both variable temperature and applied external electric field on the heterostructure can control the optical gain as well as lasing wavelength linearly. Due to the linear behavior of the proposed heterostructure, the tunable type –II InGaAsP/GaAsSb nano-scale heterostructure can be claimed as a very suitable heterostructure for the designing of photovoltaic devices operating in the IR region. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Travelling Salesperson Problem being a classic combinatorial optimization problem is an interesting but a challenging problem to be solved. It falls under the class of NPhard problem and becomes non-solvable for large data set by traditional methods like integer linear programming and branch and bound method, being the earlier popular approaches. Genetic Algorithm based solutions emerged as the most popular tool to solve this which is a heuristic mechanism to find the closest approximate solution to the problem. In this paper, we approach Travelling Salesman Problem using GA approach, a natural selection technique which repeatedly modifies a population of individual solutions, with the added power of modern computing systems. Here we come up with a parallel version of GA for both multicore and many core architectures over OpenMP and CUDA in order to make some of the challenging problems like Vehicle Routing Problem for google maps, DNA sequencing and many more optimization problems involving a good amount of complex computation and data handling. The paper presents a comparative analysis of the results for both CUDA and OpenMP for various degree and structure of graphs depicting close approximation to the accuracy in terms of most optimal path for traversal with highly reduced execution time. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper predict the effect of the object's morphology on the final accuracy of the scanned data, for the case of contactless laser scanning. On the basis of the scanned objects morphology, two important process parameters are specified namely scanning angle and distance of the laser from the part surface. Experiments have been performed with different scanning conditions using full factorial design. An analytical prediction model for determining the standard deviation of the final surface is developed in terms of the aforesaid scanning parameters using response surface methodology (RSM). Furthermore, the optimal scanning parameters are predicted after comparing two almost unexplored nature inspired algorithms i.e. Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) and Moth-Flame Optimization (MFO). Finally, two realistic non-trivial case studies are considered for validation of the proposed methodology. The result shows that the standard deviation of the final reverse engineered models significantly reduced by 21.6% and 13.77%. The adopted methodology provides the optimal combination of morphological scanning process parameters with a considerable reduction in standard deviation for final scanned surface models. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter Berlin/Boston.},

abstract={Traffic signal control system is now become very challenging task. It is necessary make road traffic decent, safe, less time and fuel consuming. There is a requirement to improvise the traffic signal control for better traffic control. In past few years traffic control system handles such a situation but not that much effectively because they are static . There should be a system which should be dynamic in nature so that it can handle traffic easily. This system gives improvement in the performance of traffic intersections control. This paper provides overview of fuzzy logic control system used for better control of flow of traffic β at every road intersection. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Brownian motion had been a topic of interest since the last two centuries and researchers have investigated the motion considering size, environment and mass. Few attempts considering the non-rigidity had been published to establish correlation between variance and nanoparticle parameter like size, mass and non-rigidity (stiffness) [1] [2]. In continuation, the present work investigates the significance of non-rigidity (stiffness) on variance in motion of nanoparticle. This work is important to conclude on whether soft nanoparticle moves more or less vis-à-vis a hard nanoparticle. We developed a model using correlation technique applied on Langevin equation for Brownian motion of nanoparticle and based on the simulation results, it was found that the motion is significantly governed by the stiffness of nanoparticles. © 2017 IEEE.},

Introducing a nanorobot inside a human body faces various challenges. One of the major challenges is its propulsion mechanism. Since the flow regime is of low Reynolds number, normal propulsion systems would find itself impossible to produce net forward thrust in such media. A rigid helix is found to produce thrust force and is a perfect place to start with in low Reynolds number propulsion. In this paper, a set of helical flagella has been fabricated in macro domain and the effect of change of wavelength, wire diameter and helix diameter is investigated on the thrust force produced by rigid helical filament using Resistive Force Theory. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper reports structural, electrical, and gas sensing characteristics of n-ZnO/p-Si heterojunction diodes fabricated using RF sputtering technique. The microstructural and surface morphological properties have been studied using X-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy, respectively. The electrical properties of the fabricated diodes have been investigated using current-voltage (I - V) and capacitance-voltage (C - V) measurements. The estimated values for rectification ratio, ideality factor, and barrier height were found to be ∼100, 3.27, and 0.72eV, respectively, at room temperature. The values recorded for carrier concentration and barrier height using C - V measurement were 3.82× 1014 cm-3 and 0.79 eV, respectively. The value of series resistance using Chueng's function was found to be 1710 Ω. After detailed structural and electrical characterization, methanol sensing response (3-100 ppm) of n-ZnO/p-Si heterojunction diodes for the temperature range of 27 °C-150 °C have also been investigated. The optimum operating temperature for methanol sensing was found to be considerably low, i.e., 100 °C. The values of response magnitude, response time and recovery time at 100 °C were estimated as 82%, ∼4 and ∼7 s, respectively. The cross sensitivity study for the nearest interfering species, such as ethanol, 1-propanol, butanol, butanone, and benzene, has confirmed the high selectivity of n-ZnO/p-Si heterojunction diodes for methanol sensing. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, we present highly accurate and very efficient stack based surrogate models for standby (idle-time) statistical leakage estimation of CMOS circuits using sampling based methods. Our aim is to replace SPICE simulation with our proposed surrogate models, which can be used to evaluate samples generated by sampling methods in variation space. Our methodology initiates by first characterizing the leakage of basic transistor stacks and then provides estimate of the leakage of basic gates based on these stacks. Transistor stacks are extracted across various standard cells, which are used to estimate leakage of CMOS gates with different input vector combinations. We develop Support Vector Machine (SVM) regression surrogate models and characterize the transistor stacks of CMOS gates, while accounting the combined effect of process variations in transistor length (L), threshold voltage (Vth), oxide thickness (Tox), supply voltage (0.6V−1.2V), temperature (0°C−100°C) and width (28nm−200nm), all scalable at the same time. For gates containing parallel transistor stacks, we merge the parallel transistors having identical inputs, which in turn allows us to use precharacterized basic stacks for leakage calculation, thus avoiding generation of new models. Our experiments illustrate that we only require 30 and 26 stack models to predict the subthreshold and gate tunneling leakage of 20 different gates across 176 input combinations, instead of characterizing leakage model for each input vector separately. SVM regression models generated in our approach have the ability to predict the leakage with maximum average error of 2.7% in mean (μ) and maximum average error of 3.1% in standard deviation (σ), both for OAI22 gate. Our results establish that there is on an average 10× improvement in runtime while estimating the μ and σ of leakage of a gate within 10000 Monte Carlo simulation loop. Our approaches also result into a maximum of 221× runtime improvement for C6288 ISCAS'85 benchmark circuit. We further develop Sparse SVM models using Support Vector spectrum pruning method, which reduces the runtime of the regression models with negligible increase in the error. Runtime efficiency of 17× and 323× is achieved on standard cell library and C6288 benchmark circuit respectively using Sparse SVM models. Our models outperform previous models based on analytical equations and Artificial Neural Network in terms of accuracy. © 2017},

abstract={A theoretical study is presented here for the electro-osmosis modulated peristaltic three-layered capillary flow of viscous fluids with different viscosities in the layers. The layers considered here are the core layer, the intermediate layer and the peripheral layer. The analysis has been carried out under a number of physical restrictions viz. Debye-Hückel linearization (i.e. wall zeta potential ≤ 25 mV) is assumed sufficiently small, thin electric double layer limit (i.e. the peripheral layer is much thicker than the electric double layer thickness), low Reynolds number and large wavelength approximations. A non-dimensional analysis is used to linearize the boundary value problem. Fluid-fluid interfaces, peristaltic pumping characteristics, and trapping phenomenon are simulated. Present study also evaluates the responses of interface, pressure rise, time-averaged volume flow rate, maximum pressure rise, and the influence of Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity on the mechanical efficiency (with two different cases of the viscosity of fluids between the intermediate and the peripheral layer). Trapping phenomenon along with bolus dynamics evolution with thin EDL effects are analyzed. The findings of this study may ultimately be useful to control the microvascular flow during the fractionation of blood into plasma (in the peripheral layer), buffy coat (intermediate layer) and erythrocytes (core layer). This work may also contributes in electrophoresis, hematology, electrohydrodynamic therapy and, design and development of biomimetic electro-osmotic pumps. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Automobile emissions are the main source of greenhouse gases (GHG) accumulation in environment. As old engines (Euro III or earlier) produce more emissions and it will be difficult to entirely stop their usage especially in developing and underdeveloped nations, it is desired that appropriate emission reduction technologies are tested on such engines to analyze their feasibility and economical acceptability. While most such studies have been conducted on constant speed stationary engines and modern engines, this study tried to analyze the effectiveness of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system on a Euro-1, water-cooled, direct injection, variable speed, compression ignition (C.I.) engine in a laboratory setup in India. This was done by testing an electronic control unit (ECU)-controlled EGR valve running the engine on different speeds; with different torques, as also with varying EGR percentages. Then optimum value of EGR valve opening for each set of engine speed and torque was determined, that is, corresponding to minimum oxides of nitrogen (NOx). Optimum EGR valve position was programmatically fed, for each set of torque and engine speed (in RPM), into EGR ECU and then the engine was run at varying speeds and torques and the emissions were verified in the automated mode. It was found that using EGR, NOx emissions were substantially reduced (average 45% reduction), without significantly impacting the engine performance. However, smoke emission increased with EGR. In order to counter the adverse effects, additional emission reduction technologies should be used in tandem with EGR. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 36: 1685–1693, 2017. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog},

abstract={Cold expansion of fastener/rivet holes is a common way to generate beneficial compressive residual stress around the fastener hole. In this study, cold expansion process was simulated by finite-element method in order to determine the residual stress field around two cold expanded holes by varying the plate thickness and expansion ratio of the hole. The model was developed in ANSYS and assigned to aluminium alloy 7475-T61 material model. The results showed that the residual stress become more compressive as the plate thickness is increased up to t/d = 2.6 and decreased for further level of thickness. In addition, the residual stress at the edge of the hole become more compressive as the expansion ratio is increased up to 4.5% and decreased for further level of expansion. This study also found that the residual stresses near the entrance and the exit face of the plate are less compressive than the residual stresses on the mid-thickness of the plate. © 2017 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Quaternary and ternary alloy semiconductors offer an extra degree of flexibility in terms of bandgap tuning. Modifications in the wave functions and alterations in optical transitions in quaternary and ternary QW (quantum well) heterostructures due to external uniaxial strain provide valuable insights on the characteristics of the heterostructure. This paper reports the optical gain in strained InGaAsP/GaAsSb type-II QW heterostructure (well width = 20 Å) under external uniaxial strain at room temperature (300 K). The entire heterostructure is supposed to be grown on InP substrate pseudomorphically. Band structure, wave functions, energy dispersion and momentum matrix elements of the heterostructure have been computed. 6 × 6 diagonalised k→·p→ Hamiltonian matrix of the system is evaluated and Luttinger-Kohn model has been applied for the band structure and wavefunction calculations. TE mode optical gain spectrum in the QW-heterostructure under uniaxial strain along [110] is calculated. Optical gain of the heterostructure as a function of 2D carrier density and temperature variation is investigated. The variation of the peak optical gain as a function of As and Sb fractions in InGaAsP as a barrier and GaAsSb as a well respectively is exhibited. For a charge carrier injection of 5×1012/cm2, the TE optical gain is 3952 cm−1 at room temperature under no external uniaxial strain. Significant increase in TE mode optical gain is observed under high external uniaxial strain (1, 5 and 10 GPa) along [110] within IR (Infrared region) region. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={We employ the relativistic mean-field plus BCS (RMF+BCS) approach to study the behavior of sd-shell by investigating in detail the single particle energies, and proton and neutron density profiles along with the deformations and radii of even-even nuclei. Emergence of new shell closure, weakly bound structure and most recent phenomenon of bubble structure are reported in the sd-shell. 22C, 24O and 26S are found to have a weakly bound structure due to particle occupancy in 2s1/2 state. On the other hand 22O, 34Ca and 34,48Si are found with depleted central density due to the unoccupied 2s1/2 state and hence they are the potential candidates of bubble structure. 22C and 24O emerge as doubly magic with N = 16 in accord with the recent experiments and 26S emerges as a new proton magic nucleus with Z = 16. N = 14 and Z = 14 are predicted as magic numbers in doubly magic 22O, 34Ca and 34,48Si, respectively. These results are found in agreement with the recent experiments and have consistent with the other parameters of RMF and other theories. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={This paper presents and discusses AC-DC converters used for the Electrolysis of the non-ferrous metals and a case study of Aluminum Smelters at Hindalco to validate that thyristor converters are more energy efficient than diode converters. The most important factor in Aluminium production is the cost of energy used in the process of converting Aluminium oxide to Aluminium. This energy, which accounts for nearly 35% - 40% of the total cost of production of the metal, is primarily in the form of Direct Current (DC) power. DC Power is used in the process of electrolysis to convert Alumina (Aluminium Oxide) to Aluminium. With most of the production of electricity across the world is in the form of Alternating Current (AC) power, the process of conversion of this AC power to DC Power is critical. An efficient AC - DC converter becomes a critical component in the electrolytic reduction process of extracting non-ferrous metals in general and Aluminium in particular. The purpose of this research is to explore the reasons of mixed use of both the converter technologies, re-evaluate actual efficiency data on usage of both technologies and recommend the use of the more appropriate technology based on practical study. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={In the present study, the phase change behavior of prepared novel composites of palmitic acid and nano titanium dioxide (TiO2) for thermal energy storage have been investigated. The nano-particles are dispersed into the base fluid in various mass fractions (0.5, 1, 3, and 5%) and their effects on the thermo-physical properties have been investigated. Structural analysis has been carried out by using FESEM and crystallography was checked by XRD technique. Thermal conductivity of palmitic acid increased gradually by 12.7, 20.6, 46.6, and 80% for the nano-particle weight fractions of 0.5, 1, 3, and 5% respectively. Based on the results, it can be mentioned that the prepared palmitic acid based nano-enhanced organic phase change composite materials can be very well used as potential solar thermal energy storage materials. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Due to increased data movement and information exchange over internet and web, preserving data confidentiality and security has emerged as a prime concern for the end users. From bank transactions to document verification portals, from government official websites to social media, all these platforms share data remotely over web which contains certain confidential information and thus uses security mechanisms based on cryptographic algorithm to preserve the confidentiality of data preventing any information leakage or breach. RSA being the most popular public key cryptography based algorithm uses data encryption and decryption technique. It uses the mathematical concept of factorization of prime integers. The efficiency of the algorithm in terms of enhancing the security aspect to guess the factors of prime numbers increase when the numbers have high powers. Computing prime factors of these large numbers is compute intensive task where the serial programming makes RSA algorithm to slow down. The paper here presents an OpenMP based algorithmic modification to the code of RSA algorithm to improve the execution time using the parallel processing power of modern day multi-core architecture based machines. Experimental results under the lights of graphical representation shows a considerable speed up gained over the traditional implementation. Further the paper also compares the efficiency with other parallel implementations of RSA algorithm where the reported algorithm is found to perform almost equivalent to the GPGPU based implementation without the need of extra hardware in the form of graphics card and with reduced power consumption of the machine. The paper sums up with a conclusion that GPU based acceleration can be clubbed with proposed method to generate factors severely large prime numbers making it highly difficult to guess the factors.},

As revealed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra the nanoparticles change their phase from anatase to rutile when the annealing temperature goes beyond 650°C. W-H plot for the powder samples annealed at 450°C and 750°C shows the presence of tensile strain in them which affects the particle size. The difference in particle sizes obtained from Debye-Scherer formula and W-H plot is seen to reduce for lesser strain value. The field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) images are observed to depict the agglomerated clusters of the particles whose average size favors the XRD results. The absorption is seen to show a red shift, as annealing temperature is raised. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Human Gait is a model of movement while locomotion and it is known as behavioural characteristic of human. Gait recognition is a behavioural biometric method that includes human identification from afar i.e. in absence of human and this is achieved by analysing the behaviour of their walking. Main aim to make GAIT recognition system is to impart a best method to recognize risks in places where high security is required like in banking, parking, airports etc. or to detect disease like Parkinson’s. In this paper we have shown the importance of gait recognition in order to detect whether a human GAIT is normal or abnormal, firstly the features of human gait is collected and then they are classified using neural network (Back propagation) and KNN classification technique. To test the proposed system the database contains 204 gaits and 16 different features were recognised, in which 3 datasets are crouch gait dataset and one normal gait dataset of 4 different humans is collected. We have obtained 100% of classification accuracy for a training data. Testing results shows 39.65% accuracy overall accuracy of system is 69.825%.},

abstract={The present investigation focuses the effect of process parameters on material removal rate (MRR) and surface roughness (Ra) in wire electric discharge machining of Inconel 625. Machining was done by using a normal zinc coated wire and cryogenic treated zinc coated wire. The experiments were performed by considering different process parameters viz. tool electrode, current intensity, pulse on time, pulse off time, wire feed and wire tension. The thickness of work material and dia. of wire are kept constant. Taguchi L18 (21 * 35) orthogonal array of experimental design is used to perform the experiments. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is employed to optimize the material removal rate and surface roughness. Based on analysis it is found that pulse on time, tool electrode and current intensity are the significant parameters that affect the material removal rate and surface roughness. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) are used to identify the microstructure of the machined work piece. © 2017 King Saud University},

abstract={Composite materials are being extensively used in aerospace and automotive industry. The demand for composite materials is increasing due to their superior properties such as high strength to weight ratio, good corrosion resistance and high stiffness. Post machining operations such as drilling, orthogonal cutting, turning are necessary for composite materials to meet the dimensional and functional requirements. Drilling is a major process in manufacturing of holes, required for assembling the components in industrial applications. Drilling of holes in composites leads to a drilling-induced damage called delamination. The researchers have tried to reduce the drilling-induced damage by minimizing the operating variables and tool design. However, the research on delamination analysis using finite element method (FEM) is limited. This paper provides a comprehensive literature review on machining of composites which mainly focuses on conventional methods like turning, milling, trimming and drilling and also on simulation methods including discrete element method and finite element method. A brief and in depth review for drilling of composites using finite element method is delivered, which provides a knowledge on damage of the composites caused during drilling and orthogonal cutting. Comparison of experimental and simulation results shows an overall vision on machining of CFRP using FEM tools. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

These complexes were characterized by elemental analysis, FTIR and NMR (1H, 13C, 27Al) spectral studies. Spectral studies of these complexes suggest the presence of bi-dentate mode of the oximato moieties in the solution state. Soft transformations of aluminium(III) iso-propoxide and their oxime derivatives to pure alumina were carried out by the sol-gel technique. The powder XRD patterns of all the formed alumina suggest formation of cubic phase (γ-alumina) with average crystallites size of 7–30 nm. Optically transparent crack free alumina film was deposited on glass substrate using alumina sol, prepared by complex [Al(OiPr){ONC(CH3)2}], through dip coating method. The film sintered at 500 °C is amorphous in nature as indicated by XRD study. The alumina film is found to be ∼95% optically transparent in the visible region.

abstract={Mycosporine-like amino acids are the most common group of transparent ultraviolet radiation absorbing intracellular secondary metabolites. These molecules absorb light in the range of ultraviolet-A and -B with a maximum absorbance between 310 and 362 nm. Cyanobacteria might have faced the most deleterious ultraviolet radiation, which leads to an evolution of ultraviolet protecting mycosporine-like amino acids for efficient selection in the environment. In the last 30 years, scientists have investigated various cyanobacteria for novel mycosporine-like amino acids, applying different induction techniques. This review organizes all the cyanobacterial groups that produce various mycosporine-like amino acids. We found out that cyanobacteria belonging to orders Synechococcales, Chroococcales, Oscillatoriales, and Nostocales are frequently studied for the presence of mycosporine-like amino acids, while orders Gloeobacterales, Spirulinales, Pleurocapsales, and Chroococcidiopsidales are still need to be investigated. Nostoc and Anabaena strains are major studied genus for the mycosporine-like amino acids production. Hence, this review will give further insight to the readers about potential mycosporine-like amino acid producing cyanobacterial groups in future investigations. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

abstract={A numerical simulation for three dimensional steady flow of nanofluids passing through an exponential stretching sheet in presence of magnetohydrodymaics is presented. The surface of stretching sheet is considered as pervious. Buongiorno model associated with Brownian motion and thermophoretic diffusion is also employed. Well known similarity transformations are used to convert the governing equations into a set of ordinary differential equations. The transformed equations are then solved numerically using fourth order Runge-Kutta method. The effects of transverse magnetic field and permiability on dimensionless fluid velocity, fluid temperature, skin friction, Nusselt number and Sherwood number are examined. The numerical results accomplished in the present study are validated and felt to be in good agreement with the previously published results. The numerical computations reveal that that the Lorentz force due to presence of magnetic field impinges its resistance on fluid motion and enhances the thermal resistance. As a consequence, heat transfer rate from the sheet gets reduced in association with the porosity of the medium. © 2017},

abstract={This paper deals with a problem where the effect of variable magnetic field and chemical reaction on free convective flow of an electrically conducting incompressible water based nanofluid over an exponentially stretching sheet has been investigated. In the present study, Buongiorno model associated with Brownian motion and thermophoretic diffusion is employed to describe the heat transfer enhancement of nanofluids. Some suitable similarity transformations reduced the governing boundary layer non-linear partial differential equations into a set of ordinary non-linear differential equations. The transformed equations are then solved numerically using fourth order Runga-Kutta method along with Shooting technique. The major outcomes of the present study is that the magnetic field impedes the fluid motion while thermal as well as mass buoyancy forces accelerate it, the thermophoretic diffusion enhances dimensionless fluid temperature as well as concentration leading to thicker thermal and concentration boundary layers. On the other hand, concentration exponent, Brownian motion parameter and chemical reaction parameter exhibit reverse trend on temperature and concentration. In addition, the presence of magnetic field under the influence of thermal as well as mass buoyancies supports to reduce the rate of heat transfer as well as wall shear stress while the first order chemical reaction develops a thinner concentration boundary layer. © 2017 The Society of Powder Technology Japan},

abstract={This paper presents a novel approach in addressing a critical power system issue, i.e., automatic generation control (AGC) in a smart grid scenario. It proposes the design and implementation of an optimized fuzzy logic controller (FLC) for AGC of interconnected power network. There are three different sources of power generation considered in the two-area interconnected model of power system network. First area is equipped with a single reheat thermal unit and a superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) unit, while another area has a hydro-unit with SMES. A multi-stage optimization strategy for the optimal solution of FLC for tie-line and frequency oscillation suppression is proposed in this paper using an ant colony optimization technique. The optimization of FLC is carried out in four different stages. The first stage is the optimization of range of input and output variables; the second stage is the optimization of membership function; the third and fourth stages are the optimization for rule base and rule weight optimization, respectively. The performance of the proposed controller is also compared with another control approaches to stabilize Ptie-line and Δf oscillations; these are the Ziegler–Nichols-tuned proportional–integral–derivative (PID) controller and genetic algorithm optimized PID controller. A comprehensive analysis of the traditional techniques and proposed techniques is presented on the basis of major dynamic performance parameters, i.e., settling time and peak overshoot. © 2017, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Neuroinflammation, the condition associated with the hyperactivity of immune cells within the CNS (central nervous system), has recently been linked to a host range of neurodegenerative disorders. Targeting neuroinflammation could be of prime importance as recent research highlights the beneficial aspects associated with modulating the inflammatory mediators associated with the CNS. One of the main obstructions in neuroinflammatory treatments is the hindrance posed by the blood-brain barrier for the delivery of drugs. Hence, research has focused on novel modes of transport for drugs to cross the barrier through drug delivery and nanotechnology approaches. In this Review, we highlight the therapeutic advancement made in the field of neurodegenerative disorders by focusing on the effect neuroinflammation treatment has on these conditions. © 2017 American Chemical Society.},

In this paper, complexity of algorithm is analyzed by increasing value of n larger than 2 and 3; which is useful to give more security to the data and confidential information over the network or internet.

In design I, ADF based on quasi-square PCRR with circular scatters is proposed and analysed for optimized performance. This device consists of rectangular waveguides and a quasi-square PCRR. A good wavelength selective filter with bandwidth about 10.20nm and centre wavelength of pass band 1.4201um is achieved. In the next design, photonic crystal quasi-square cavity based ADF is realised with elliptical scatters for different major and minor axis configurations thus having different ellipticity. It is observed that the output response of the filter is very sensitive to the dimensions of coupling rods and scatter rods. It is observed that when the radius of the scatter rods is increased, then the centre wavelength of the bands get shifted towards higher wavelength range. © 2017 IEEE.},

This paper reports optical gain realized in Al0.8Ga0.2As/GaAs0.8P0.2 type-I QW-heterostructure (varying well width 6nm-22nm). Band alignment, wavefunctions and optical gain of the nano-scale heterostructure under electromagnetic field perturbation is reported. The 6×6 diagonalised k. p Hamiltonian matrix is evaluated and Luttinger-Kohn model has been applied for the band structure calculations. Optical gain spectrum in the QW-heterostructure under external electric fields of (20, 40 and 60 kV/cm) is calculated. Optical gain (x and z polarizations) of the nano-scale heterostructure under well width and temperature variations is investigated. The optical gain spectrum of the heterostructure is seen to gradually rise with shrinking well width. Also the optical gain curve shows a decrease in gain with rising temperature levels. For a charge carrier injection of 4 × 1012/cm2 the optical gain is ∼220 under input x polarization [100] and ∼625 under z polarization [001] at 300K. The heterostructure is seen to be operating in the energy range of 1.5 to 1.75 eV (708 to 826 nm). Thus, a wide range wavelength tuning is achievable. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Biomimetic synthesis of metal nanoparticles (NPs) is safe and eco-friendly; therefore, find diverse applications. Considering this, the soil fungi Penicillium chrysogenum strain Fungal germplasm collection centre/BLS1 was isolated, characterized and explored to synthesize extracellular silver NPs (AgNPs) under optimised conditions. The synthesis of AgNPs was investigated using ultraviolet (UV)-visible spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis. Process optimisation exhibited AgNPs synthesis within 8 h using 2 mM AgNO3 at pH 11 and temperature 70°C. TEM analysis revealed polydispersed ellipsoidal shaped AgNPs with average particle size 96.8 nm as measured by DLS. AgNPs showed negative zeta potential that confers surface stability in solution. FTIR spectra confirmed the presence of protein bound to AgNPs. Antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus by the AgNPs (100 ppm) was demonstrated by counting colony forming unit, disc diffusion, and growth kinetics assay. Additionally radial assay revealed antifungal activity of AgNPs (100 ppm) against phytopathogenic fungi Sclerotinia sclerotiorum Microbial type culture collection 8785. Furthermore, AgNPs (100 ppm) did not show any cytotoxic effects on human Red blood cells. Therefore, this novel fungal strain can be utilised for biofabrication of AgNPs under optimised conditions and have shown strong antimicrobial property. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2017.},

abstract={Abstract: Heteroleptic complexes of the type [V(NPh)(OiPr)3-n{(ONC)(CH3)(C4H3O-2)}n] {where n = 1 (1), 2 (2) and 3 (3)} were synthesized by the reactions of [V(NPh)(OiPr)3] (A) with 2-acetylfuryl oxime in different molar ratios in anhydrous benzene. All these new derivatives have been characterized by elemental analyses, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (1H, 13C {1H}), 51V) and fast atom bombardment mass spectral studies. Spectral studies appear to be indicating mono-dentate and bi-dentate mode of attachment of the oximato moieties in the solution and solid state, respectively. Fast atom bombardment mass study of one of the representative derivative, [V(NPh){(ONC)(CH3)(C4H3O-2)}3] (3) suggests the monomeric nature of all these complexes. Thermogravimetric curve of [V(NPh){(ONC)(CH3)(C4H3O-2)}3] (3) shows large thermal events. Hydrolysis of [V(NPh)(OiPr)3] (A) and [V(NPh){(ONC)(CH3)(C4H3O-2)}3] (3) in moist propan-2-ol medium yielded vanadia, (a) and (b), respectively. However, hydrolysis of [V(NPh)(OiPr)3] (A) in n-hexane medium using calculated amount of water yielded hybrid material, (vn).The presence of (V = NPh) group in (vn) is confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance spectral studies as well as by the thermogravimetric study. The X-ray diffraction patterns of vanadia, (a) and (b) indicate formation of orthorhombic phase and the scanning electron microscope images of (a) and (b) show rod like morphology of the crystallites. Absorption spectra of vanadia, (a) and (b) indicate energy band gaps of 2.62 and 2.43 eV, respectively.

abstract={This paper presents a modified particle swarm optimization (MPSO) algorithm for the evaluation of geometric characteristics defining form and function of planar surfaces. The geometric features of planar surfaces are decomposed into four components; namely straightness, flatness, perpendicularity, and parallelism. A non-linear minimum zone objective function is formulated mathematically for each planar surface geometric characteristic. Finally, the result of the proposed method is compared with previous work on the same problem and with other nature inspired algorithms. The results demonstrate that the proposed MPSO algorithm is more efficient and accurate in comparison to other algorithms and is well suited for effective and accurate evaluation of planar surface characteristics. © 2017 Vimal Kumar Pathak et al.},

abstract={This paper emphasizes the development of control strategy for inter-area oscillation suppression for a unified two-area hydro–thermal deregulated power system. A proportional derivative-type fuzzy logic controller with integral (PDFLC+I) controller was proposed for automatic generation control. Further comparisons among conventional integral controller, proportional integral derivative controller, and PDFLC+I are carried out, where the PDFLC+I controller is optimized by four different optimization techniques namely, algorithm, ant colony optimization, classical particle swarm optimization, and adaptive particle swarm optimization. In PDFLC+I controller optimization, scaling parameters of controllers are optimized. A comparative study shows that the proposed PDFLC+I controller has a better dynamic response following a step load change for the combination of PoolCo and bilateral contract-type transaction in deregulated environment. Proposed controller performance has also been examined for ±30% variation in system parameters. Non-linearity in the form of governor dead band is taken into account during simulation. © 2017, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={The present numerical simulations are carried out to investigate the effect of viscous dissipation, temperature dependent viscosity and heat source/sink on magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) unsteady Carreaue nanofluid over a cone filled with different alloy nanoparticles. We considered two different types of alloy nanoparticle namely nickel chromium iron alloy (Nimonic 80A) and titanium aluminum vanadium alloy (Ti%6Al%4V). The governing equations of the flow are solved using the Runge-Kutta and Newton's method. The present numerical results are compared with the previous study and found agreement with the uncertainty of ± 2.5%. Effects of various non-dimensional parameters such as Eckert number, power index parameter, volume fraction, heat source/sink parameter, viscous variation parameter and semi-vertical angle of the cone on the momentum and thermal boundary layer including the friction factor coefficients and local Nusselt number are presented and analyzed for two different alloy considered in the present study. It is found that the viscous variation parameter enables to enhance the heat transfer rate. The Ti%6Al%4V alloy has higher friction factor coefficient along the azimuthal direction of the flow while Nimonic 80A alloy boosts up the friction coefficient along the tangential direction. It is worth to mention that the heat transfer rate of Nimonic 80A alloy is higher than that of Ti%6Al%4V alloy. Hence, Nimonic 80A alloy signifies a better thermal performance than the Ti%6Al%4V alloy. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In a mobile wireless network, the unnecessary handoff is the main issue that effects the performance of the network. A handoff occurs when the Received Signal Strength (RSS) is less than the threshold RSS and the new RSS (from neighbors Access point) is more than the present RSS. Earlier the handoff decision algorithms consider RSS only which results in an increase in handoff counting or handoff rate but in a wireless communication system, the signal strength varies due to scattering, shadowing and reflection because of obstacles in the network region. This variation in RSS leads to unnecessary handoff. In this paper, a new method for handoff decision is proposed to reduce the unnecessary handoff. With simulation results or mathematical analysis 25% unnecessary handoff reduced. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Android operating system is widespread in today's smart-phone market due to its open source model, its easy functionality and huge number of Apps and App-Stores (the official and others). The coverage of some 90% of the market, it is also the place-holder for user's personal as well as sensitive information (IMEI, IMSI, etc.). There is a tendency of Apps user to trust on Android OS for securing his/her data but it has been proved that Android OS is more vulnerable to exploitation either for fun or for monetary purpose. Malware detection for Android OS has become an upcoming research problem of interest. Dynamic Taint Analysis is an efficient analysis in existing Android malware detection analysis. The aim of this paper is to work towards Dynamic Taint Analysis of Android malware using automatic tagging and with out modification in Android platform. In order to do this, this paper surveys exhaustively the available literature and works related to dynamic taint analysis. This paper proposes some novel ideas to improve the existing solution with more accuracy. There are two phases of our novel algorithm, the first phase is training phase for feature extraction and the second phase is the analysis phase for automatic tagging and tainting. We have developed a framework named AndroTaint, which is working on Dynamic Taint Analysis. AndroTaint follows a novel supervised and unsupervised Anomaly Detection technique with high precision, recall and harmonic mean. Our Dynamic Taint Analysis algorithm categorizes the App is risky, benign, malicious or aggressive as per their feature and behaviour. We have measured AndroTaint effectiveness on the basis of timeline for building dataset and 10-fold cross validation. AndroTaint covers 90% of malware and benign in analysis phase with less false positive and false negative. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={India's commercial building sector is witnessing robust growth. India continues to be a key growth market among global corporates and this is reflective in the steady growth in demand for prime office space. A recent trend that has been noted is the increase in demand for office spaces not just in major cities but also in smaller tier II and Tier III cities. Growth in the commercial building sector projects a rising trend of energy intensive mechanical systems in office buildings in India. The air conditioning market in India is growing at 25% annually. This is due to the ever increasing demand to maintain thermal comfort in tropical regions. Air conditioning is one of the most energy intensive technologies which are used in buildings. As a result India is witnessing significant spike in energy demand and further widening the demand supply gap. Challenge in India is to identify passive measures in building envelope design in office buildings to reduce the cooling loads and conserve energy. This paper investigates the overall heat gain through building envelope components and natural ventilation in warm and humid climate region through experimental and simulation methods towards improved thermal environmental performance. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Education and human development are in conjunction with the dynamism of the contemporary world. The education system has sensed the need to churn out young entrepreneurs in order to drive the economy forward at a significant pace, and today entrepreneurship development is headway with a host of technical subjects. However, it is imperative to recognise that the entrepreneur is first and foremost, a brand on his/her own accord, even before he/she projects his/her company. One's image is crucial in the advancement of his/her venture and life at large. In today's competitive world, one has to stand out amidst the multitudes, personally as well as professionally. Technical know-how is not always enough as a professional. One needs the winning edge! Image Management concretely leverages one's position on the ladder of growth, success and recognition as well as aspirations in the vitality of the contemporary world. Thus emerges a weighty need for the incorporation of the study of Image Management in the education system for every budding entrepreneur. Ironically, the education system has yet to recognise and explore this area. The paper recognises this need and attempts to conceptually bridge the gap by bringing forth the relevance, purpose and utility of Image Management. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.

abstract={Background and objectives This paper aims to investigate the unsteady flow of two types of nanofluids i.e Copper water nanofluids and Silver water nanofluids) through finite length non-uniform channel driven by peristaltic sinusoidal wave propagations. Methods The governing equations are reduced in linear form using dimensional analysis and considering the low Reynolds number and large wavelength approximations. The time dependent temperature field, axial velocity, transverse velocity and pressure difference are obtained analytically in closed form solution. Trapping phenomenon is also discussed with the help of contour plots of stream function. A comparative study of pure water (Newtonian fluid), Copper water nanofluids and Silver water nanofluids under the influence of relevant physical parameters is made in graphical form and also discussed. The effects of absorption parameter and Grashof number on velocity profiles, temperature profiles and pressure distribution along the length of channel are examined. Results conclusions The computational results reveal that the velocity profile is maximum for Silver water nanofluids however, it is least for Copper water nanofluids. It is also concluded the temperature profile is more for pure water in comparison to Silver water and Copper water nanofluids. This model is applicable to design, micro-peristaltic pumps which help in Nanoparticle-based targeted drug delivery and to transport the sensitive or corrosive fluids, sanitary fluids, slurries and noxious fluids in nuclear industry. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

Wall slip hydrodynamic and also thermal buoyancy effects are included. The artery is simulated as an isotropic elastic tube, following Joshi et al. (2009), and a variable viscosity formulation is employed for the flowing blood. The equations governing the transport phenomena are non-dimensionalized and the resulting boundary value problem is solved analytically in the steady state subject to physically appropriate boundary conditions. Numerical computations are conducted to quantify the effects of relevant hemodynamic, thermophysical and nanoscale parameters emerging in the model on velocity and temperature profiles, wall shear stress, impedance resistance and also streamline distributions. The model may be applicable to drug fate transport modeling with nanoparticle agents and also to the optimized design of nanoscale medical devices for diagnosing stenotic diseases in circulatory systems. © 2017, Società Italiana di Fisica and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.},

abstract={This paper focusses on the electronic and optical properties of scandium-based silver delafossite (AgScO2) semiconductor. The density functional theory (DFT) in the framework of full potential linearized augmented plane wave (FP-LAPW) scheme has been used for the present calculations with local density approximation (LDA) and generalized gradient approximation (GGA). Electronic properties deal with energy bands and density of states (DOSs), while optical properties describe refractive index and absorption coefficient. The energy bands are interpreted in terms of DOSs. The computed value of band gap is in agreement with that reported in the literature. Our results predict AgScO2 as indirect band-gap semiconductor. Our calculated value of the refractive index in zero frequency limits is 2.42. The absorption coefficient predicts the applicability of AgScO2 in solar cells and flat panel liquid crystal display as a transparent top window layer. © Indian Academy of Sciences.},

abstract={The poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) polymer blend films were prepared by solution casting method with varying PolyChloroTriFluoroEthylene (PCTFE) concentrations (1–5 wt %). The crystallinity, bonding behavior and disorder in the films were investigated with X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), UV–visible and ellipsometry techniques, while surface morphology was studied using Atomic force microscopy (AFM). The nanocrystalline nature of PMMA is seen to be preserved in the blends although there are clear indications of bond modifications. The addition of PCTFE results in the improvement of overall crystallinity of the films via the interaction among PMMA and degraded PCTFE molecules when the films are casted from diluted solutions. In agreement, corresponding disorder in terms of Urbach energy shows a decreasing trend upon inclusion of more and more PCTFE molecules. Micro-Raman spectra are dominated by fluorescence background, which is proposed as arising from degraded PCTFE. Supporting this, FTIR spectra also shows modifications in bonding as a function of PCTFE percentage, but this bond modification is not enough to produce refractive index variation in the sample, which is dominated by the host PMMA contribution for all the PCTFE concentrations. The study suggests the useful range of PCTFE concentration in which PMMA host properties can be modified for optimizing optical and structural properties without much degradation of PCTFE. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This paper mainly focuses on the influence of transverse magnetic field as well as thermal radiation on three-dimensional free convective flow of nanofluid over a linear stretching sheet. One remarkable aspect of this study is that a new micro-convection model namely Patel model has been introduced in view of enhancement of thermal conductivity and hence more heat transfer capability of nanofluid. The non-linear partial differential equations have been converted into strong non-linear ordinary differential equations by employing suitable transformations and these transformed equations are solved by Runga-Kutta method of fourth order along with Shooting technique as well as Secant method for better approximation. From this study, it is found that the presence of magnetic field slows down the fluid motion while it enhances the fluid temperature leading to a reduction in heat transfer rate from the surface. It is also found that enhancing thermal radiation parameter causes a reduction in heat transfer rate. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={A novel algorithm for the colour image encryption is proposed in this paper. Proposed algorithm is based on image scrambling and Linear canonical Transform. The image scrambling accomplished using the chaotic function with iterations along the length of the image to be scrambled. The Linear canonical transform (LCT) is used to encrypt all the three components of colour image i.e. Red, Green and Blue at the same time. Application of the LCT over these components makes to not affect each other. So the connections between Red, Green and Blue components is condensed in the encrypted components. The security of the colour image is increased using the proposed algorithm. Simulation results represents that the proposed algorithm is best suited for the colour image encryption as well it provide safety to various attacks. © 2017 IEEE.},

The Runge-Kutta fourth-order method along with the shooting technique is employed for solving a set of coupled ordinary differential equations. The computed results reveal that heat transfer is appreciably enhanced with more porosity and rotation of the fluid. Also, varying the fluids Prandtl number from 20 to 80, the rate of heat transfer increases by 93.35% and faster cooling of the system occurs. © 2017, Società Italiana di Fisica and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.},

abstract={Biomimetic propulsion mechanisms are increasingly being explored in engineering sciences. Peristalsis is one of the most efficient of these mechanisms and offers considerable promise in microscale fluidics. Electrokinetic peristalsis has recently also stimulated significant attention. Electrical and magnetic fields also offer an excellent mode for regulating flows. Motivated by novel applications in electro-conductive microchannel transport systems, the current article investigates analytically the electromagnetic pumping of non-Newtonian aqueous electrolytes via peristaltic waves in a two-dimensional microchannel with different peristaltic waves propagating at the upper and lower channel wall (complex wavy scenario). The Stokes couple stress model is deployed to capture micro-structural characteristics of real working fluids. The unsteady two-dimensional conservation equations for mass and momentum conservation, electro-kinetic and magnetic body forces, are formulated in two dimensional Cartesian co-ordinates. The transport equations are transformed from the wave frame to the laboratory frame and the electrical field terms rendered into electrical potential terms via the Poisson-Boltzmann equation, Debye length approximation and ionic Nernst Planck equation. The dimensionless emerging linearized electro-magnetic boundary value problem is solved using integral methods. The influence of Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity (characteristic electro-osmotic velocity), couple stress length parameter (measure of the polarity of the fluid), Hartmann magnetic number, and electro-osmotic parameter on axial velocity, volumetric flow rate, time-averaged flow rate and streamline distribution are visualized and interpreted at length. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of fiber orientation and ply stacking sequence of basalt-carbon hybrid composite laminates on the critical buckling strength, experimentally and by using nonlinear finite element analysis. The composite laminated plates are simply supported and subjected to axial compression load. Nonlinear FEA results using ANSYS have good agreement with the experimental results. FEA results showed that the outer layers have the most significant influence on the buckling strength of the composite laminated material. Furthermore, placing carbon fiber reinforced layers in the outer surface of the basalt-carbon/epoxy hybrid laminates results in significant increase in the critical buckling load compared to placing basalt fiber reinforced layers in the outer surface. It is also concluded that [0 2 C/0B/+45B] S laminate is the best combination of the hybrid stacking sequences as far as buckling strength is concerned. © 2017, National Institute of Science Communication and Information Resources (NISCAIR).

Under the physiological constraints, creeping flow is taken into consideration i.e. inertial forces are small compared with viscous forces. The metachronal wavelength is also considered as very large for cilia induced MHD flow. Magnetic Reynolds number is sufficiently large to invoke magnetic induction effects. The physical problem is linearized and exact solutions are developed for the resulting boundary value problem. Closed-form expressions are presented for the stream function, pressure rise, induced magnetic field function and temperature. Mathematica symbolic software is used to compute and illustrate numerical results. The influence of physical parameters on velocity profile, pressure gradient and trapping of bolus are discussed with the aid of graphs.

The entire structure is assumed to be grown over the GaAs substrate. In order to calculate the optical gain of the structure, first 4 × 4 Kohn-Luttinger Hamiltonian is solved to determine the sub-band dispersion and corresponding envelope wave functions; and then transition matrix elements calculations is designed to perform calculations of momentum matrix elements and dipole moments of selected transitions taking into account spin concept of the charge carriers. The calculated optical gain corresponding to maximum intensity meets at photonic energy ∼ 1.64 eV and at corresponding wavelength ∼ 756 nm. The maximum gain value corresponds to e1-hh1 transitions. The simulated results are found to match with experimental results. © 2017 Author(s).},

abstract={In this paper, an end-fire antenna has been designed for forward and rear vision in airborne radar applications. The purpose of this work is to demonstrate the feasibility of end-fire Magneto-Electric dipole antenna with good bandwidth, stable gain and low cross polarization. A new kind of end-fire Magneto-Electric dipole antenna, composed of a planar electric dipole and a shorted patch has been designed and fabricated. Being different from conventional broadside Magneto-Electric dipole antenna, this antenna has been excited by Z shaped feed line to impart end-fire radiation pattern. A wide impedance bandwidth of 23.9%, with 8.5dBi peak gain and 8.7dBi peak directivity has been achieved for the frequency range 12.2GHz-15.5GHz. Antenna efficiency of 90% and low cross polarization level for entire range of operation has also been observed. The antenna also exhibits low side lobe radiations and almost identical E plane and H plane radiation patterns in the given frequency range. The antenna has a wide potential for various airborne applications in Ku band. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Load Balancing is a mechanism of efficient utilization of computing resources (i.e. CPU, Memory and Network). Cloud computing is the best option to reduce CAPEX and OPEX of the organizations. High Quality of Service (QoS) and reduction the Service Level Agreement (SLA) violation depend on efficient management of Load Imbalance problem. Cloud Service efficiency depends on proper management of physical and logical resources. Researchers did lots of work on the effective load management system. Researchers used many approaches (i.e. Ant colony, Honey Bee, Genetic, Static, and Dynamic) but still need improvement. Virtual Machines (VMs) migration system plays the vital role in load management. Our focus in this research is maximizing the utilization of VMs CPU capacity. Proposed research approach is based on Dynamic Weighted Live Migration (DWLM) to manage load imbalance problem.

abstract={Tinospora cordifolia is a prioritized medicinal plant and having an immense medicinal importance especially in Indian medicinal system. But this plant needs a regeneration protocol for its rapid propagation. An efficient regeneration protocol was developed for T. cordifolia using nodal explants. High frequency of multiple shoot formation was induced when the nodal segments were cultured on MS medium supplemented with BAP (1.0 mg L−1) and 2-iP (0.5 mg L−1). The highest mean number of shoots per nodal explant (7.9 ± 0.45) with highest shoot length (9.3 ± 0.48 cm) and 86% response were achieved on this media and hormonal concentration. The optimum rooting was obtained on ½ strength of MS medium augmented with IBA (0.5 mg L−1) with 8.3 ± 0.46 cm root length and 89% response. Micropropagated plantlets were found to be identical with the mother plant when clonal fidelity of these plantlets were analyzed with inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) marker. The berberine content was analyzed through LCMS QToF and the highest amount was found in in vitro callus (19.8 µg/gm) followed by stem (9.3 µg/gm) and leaves of field-grown plants (8.4 µg/gm). Further, presence of berberine was confirmed by ESI–MS spectra with protonated molecular ions ([M + H]+) at m/z 336. Furthermore, MS–MS fragmentation pattern confirmed for the presence of berberine in both the samples. Both the spectra (standard and samples) showed common peaks for berberine in the form of protonated molecular ions ([M + H]+) at m/z 320, m/z 304, m/z 292, m/z 278 in MS/MS mode. The study revealed that developed protocol is potent for rapid mass propagation of this plant species with high accumulation of important secondary metabolite berberine. © 2017, The Author(s).},

abstract={A mathematical model is developed to analyze electro-kinetic effects on unsteady peristaltic transport of blood in cylindrical vessels of finite length. The Newtonian viscous model is adopted. The analysis is restricted under Debye-Hückel linearization (i.e., wall zeta potential ≤ 25mV) is sufficiently small). The transformed, nondimensional conservation equations are derived via lubrication theory and long wavelength and the resulting linearized boundary value problem is solved exactly. The case of a thin electric double layer (i.e., where only slip electro-osmotic velocity considered) is retrieved as a particular case of the present model. The response in pumping characteristics (axial velocity, pressure gradient or difference, volumetric flow rate, local wall shear stress) to the influence of electro-osmotic effect (inverse Debye length) and Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity is elaborated in detail. Visualization of trapping phenomenon is also included and the bolus dynamics evolution with electro-kinetic effects examined. A comparative study of train wave propagation and single wave propagation is presented under the effects of thickness of EDL and external electric field. The study is relevant to electrophoresis in haemotology, electrohydrodynamic therapy and biomimetic electro-osmotic pumps. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={This paper presents the results of an experimental investigation of the strength, permeability, abrasion, carbonation, and shrinkage characteristics of concrete containing various percentages of copper tailing as partial replacement of natural fine aggregates. M 25 Grade concrete was designed as per specific national specifications. Copper tailing was used to replace natural sand in the range of 0-80%. It was observed that the copper-tailing concrete with up to 80% substitution exhibited a comparable compressive and flexural strength when compared to the control specimens. From the abrasion test, it was noted that the specimens could be implemented in general-purpose and heavy-duty floor tiles. The shrinkage strains, water permeability, and carbonation of copper-tailing concrete were observed to be increasing with increasing replacement amounts of copper tailing. The concrete containing copper tailing replacing up to 70% of natural fine aggregates could be recommended for all applications, and substitution levels beyond 70% could be recommended for nonstructural applications, pavements, etc. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract={A mathematical model is developed for electro-osmotic peristaltic pumping of a non-Newtonian liquid in a deformable micro-channel. Stokes' couple stress fluid model is employed to represent realistic working liquids. The Poisson-Boltzmann equation for electric potential distribution is implemented owing to the presence of an electrical double layer (EDL) in the micro-channel. Using long wavelength, lubrication theory and Debye-Huckel approximations, the linearized transformed dimensionless boundary value problem is solved analytically. The influence of electro-osmotic parameter (inversely proportional to Debye length), maximum electro-osmotic velocity (a function of external applied electrical field) and couple stress parameter on axial velocity, volumetric flow rate, pressure gradient, local wall shear stress and stream function distributions is evaluated in detail with the aid of graphs. The Newtonian fluid case is retrieved as a special case with vanishing couple stress effects. With increasing the couple stress parameter there is a significant increase in the axial pressure gradient whereas the core axial velocity is reduced. An increase in the electro-osmotic parameter both induces flow acceleration in the core region (around the channel centreline) and it also enhances the axial pressure gradient substantially.

abstract={A low voltage self-biased high swing cascode current mirror (SHCCM) with improved bandwidth has been proposed. The recently reported SHCCM architecture use the bulk-driven quasi-floating gate (BDQFG) MOS transistors to enhance the effective transconductance which improves the current mirror input resistance and bandwidth range over the same architecture realized using bulk-driven MOS transistors. To further improve the bandwidth the proposed BDQFG based SHCCM uses two resistances which makes the current mirror frequency response free from input capacitors and also reduces the parasitic capacitance effect which results in increased bandwidth with an advantage of having no degradation in other performance parameters of current mirror. The proposed current mirror operates well for input current range from 0 to 200 μA with good linearity and shows the bandwidth of 298 MHz (i.e., 1.6 times over prior reported BDQFG based SHCCM). The observed input and output resistance is 306 Ω and 165 kΩ, respectively. Further, the THD analysis is carried to prove the robustness of proposed current mirror. The complete analysis is performed on UMC 0.18 μm technology using HSpice.},

abstract={The Inhomogeneous plasma with positive ions and electrons in which collisions are taking place is considered. To include the modification due to the magnetized plasma, a static magnetic field B0 is considered to be applied in the z-direction and the wave propagation is taken at an angle θ with it in the (X, Z) plane. The ions are assumed to be cold and singly charged. Fluid equations which take into account the recombination effects are formulated for ions and the electrons. Potential is found from Poisson's equation using normal mode analysis (NMA) along with linear approximation, neglecting higher order perturbed terms. From Potential equation, dispersion relation is generated which is solved numerically for obtaining the value of ω using typical plasma parameters. The behavior of growth rate with magnetic field, propagation angle, recombination constant along with different plasma oscillation wavelength to Debye length ratio (λ / λDe) has been studied. Two types of instabilities has been observed. Both the instabilities showing the same behavior with respect to recombination constant, magnetic field and (λ / λDe) plasma oscillation wavelength to Debye wavelength ratio. But they behave opposite to each other with respect to propagation angle (angle between the magnetic field and the propagation vector). © 2017 Author(s).},

abstract={Isotropic Compton profiles of transition metal based ceramics TaB and VB have been measured using 137Cs (661.65 keV) γ-ray Compton spectrometer. The experimental momentum densities are compared with those deduced using linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) with Hartree-Fock (HF), density functional theory (DFT) with Wu-Cohen generalized gradient approximation (WCGGA) and also the hybridization of HF and DFT (namely B3PW and PBE0) schemes. It is found that LCAO-DFT-WCGGA scheme based profiles give an overall better agreement with the experimental data, for both the borides. In addition, we have computed the Mulliken's population (MP) charge transfer data, energy bands, density of states and Fermi surface topology of both the borides using full potential-linearized augmented plane wave (FP-LAPW) and LCAO methods with DFT-WCGGA scheme. Cross-overs of Fermi level by the energy bands corresponding to B-2p and valence d-states of transition metals lead to metallic character in both the compounds. Equal-valence-electron-density profiles and MP analysis suggest more ionic character of VB than that of TaB. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In this paper an attempt has been made to study the impact of textile dye industries on underground water in Jaipur region and to design a low cost method for treatment of dye stuff wastewater. Samples of underground water from 3 different locations in the study area and wastewater from textile dying industries from various stages of dying were collected, to get a broad perspective on the impact of disposal of wastewater on groundwater quality and also to assess the potential adverse effects of wastewater from various stages of textile dying industries on environment, since it is directly being used for irrigation purposes. It was concluded that though not much harm has happened to the underground water in any of these locations but the same was not fit for drinking either. Out of the 3 locations, Bagru had the worst situation followed by Sanganer and Muhana. The unit successfully eliminated arsenic and lead fully and achieved about 75% reduction in fluoride, chloride and turbidity. Chemical oxygen demand got reduced from 422.6 to 132.5 mg/L, which was highly desirable for reuse by the industry itself. © 2017 - Kalpana Corporation.},

abstract={With rising population, development, and environmental pollution, availability of potable water is shrinking fast. Thus, it is required to focus on the distillation of available water. Solar Still is one of the promising technologies available to purify water because of its low cost, energy, and skill requirement. However, the efficiency of present technology is low, so it is required to advance the designs of existing solar stills. In this study, a multi-phase three-dimensional CFD model of a simple solar still developed for simulation with using ANSYS FLUENT. The simulation has been done for transient state to validate the results with experimental data for climate conditions of Jaipur (26°13'N, 75°49'E). Within the scope of this study, simulation results were found to be in good agreement with the experimental data. It is also examined that thermal efficiency of the Solar Still is higher from 16:00 to 17:00 hrs. Parametric analyses has been done to enhance the productivity of Solar Still. Different materials were used in the basin to increase the heat capacity, absorption capacity and the evaporation rate. The impact of varying the depth of the basin water was also studied. It has been found that the Solar Still have more productivity for low water depth. © 2017 The Authors.},

abstract={Passive cooling is a building design approach that focuses on heat gain control and heat dissipation in a building in order to improve the indoor thermal comfort with low or nil energy consumption. Appropriate air temperature distribution in a room is necessary for thermal comfort. By using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) it is possible to compare optional ways of air supply for maintaining thermal comfort in a conditioned zone equipped with passive cooling like EATHE. Using these simulations, designer can choose the best method of air supply in the room diminishing the risk of an incorrect solution. This paper compares three cases in which integration of active (AC) and passive (EATHE) cooling was analysed with the help of CFD tool. The uniform heat flux from the surface was set to 55 W/m2, AC air velocity of 3 m/s and supply temperature kept constant at 291 K. k-E model was considered for the turbulence model. Results was analysed and it was concluded that minimum time taken and maximum temperature drop was achieved with the installation of both the equipment on the same side of the room. © 2017 The Authors.},

abstract={The Variable Refrigerant Flow (VRF) technology has emerged as promising alternative to conventional systems, especially for small residential and commercial buildings which are largely untouched in regard to the energy efficiency of space conditioning systems despite the huge energy saving potential. This study aims to find out whether VRF split system provides an energy efficient and viable retrofit option for this sector. This paper compares the performance of an inverter based VRF Unitary AC with Constant Volume Unitary AC using the field performance testing. Both systems were installed in two geometrically and thermally identical rooms, with 14.5 m2 floor area each. Observations were made in the months of January to May, the systems were operated from 10 AM to 6 PM, auxiliary heating was also provided to vary the zone internal load conditions; the auxiliary heat load provided by the electrical heaters was 2 kW and 4 kW. The results were analyzed and it was found that the VRF technology is energy saving only when it works on part load conditions; minimum (negative) savings were observed when the outdoor temperature was equal to the rated outdoor DBT i.e. when the system was operating at full load conditions while maximum savings i.e. 40% were observed when the outdoor DBT is nearly equal to the indoor set point temperature. © 2017 The Authors.},

abstract={A mathematical model to simulate oxygen delivery through a capillary to tissues under the influence of an external force field is presented. The multi-term general fractional diffusion equation containing force terms and a time dependent absorbent term is taken into account. Fractional calculus is applied to describe the phenomenon of sub-diffusion of oxygen in both transverse and longitudinal directions. A new computational algorithm, i.e., the new iterative method (NIM) is employed to solve the spatio-temporal fractional partial differential equation subject to appropriate physical boundary conditions. Validation of NIM solutions is achieved with a modified adomian decomposition method (MADM). A parametric study is conducted for three loading scenarios on the capillary-radial force alone, axial force alone and the combined case of both forces. The results demonstrate that the force terms markedly influence the oxygen diffusion process. For example, the radial force exerts a more profound effect than axial force on sub-diffusion of oxygen indicating that careful manipulation of these forces on capillary-tissues may assist in the effective reduction of hypoxia or other oxygen depletion phenomena. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

Therefore, the objective of present research is to use CDM approach for predicting the strain life of aluminum alloy 6061-T6 specimen subjected to stress ratio of −1 in the strain range of 0.2 to 2% at room temperature. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers.

abstract={The present investigation focusses on a mathematical study of creeping viscous flow induced by metachronal wave propagation in a horizontal ciliated tube containing porous media. Creeping flow limitations are imposed, i.e. inertial forces are small compared to viscous forces and therefore a very low Reynolds number (Re 1) is taken into account. The wavelength of metachronal wave is also considered to be very large for cilia movement. The physical problem is linearized and exact solutions are developed for the differential equation problem. Mathematica software is used to compute and illustrate numerical results. The influence of slip parameter and Darcy number on velocity profile, pressure gradient and trapping of bolus are discussed with the aid of graphs. It is found that with increasing magnitude of the slip parameter, the trapped bolus inside the streamlines increases in size. The study is relevant to biological propulsion of medical micromachines in drug delivery.},

abstract={The transport of single-wall carbon nanotube (CNT) nanofluids with temperature-dependent variable viscosity is analyzed by peristaltically driven flow. The main flow problem has been modeled using cylindrical coordinates and flow equations are simplified to ordinary differential equations using long wavelength and low Reynolds' number approximation. Analytical solutions have been obtained for axial velocity, pressure gradient and temperature. Results acquired are discussed graphically for better understanding. It is observed that with an increment in the Grashof number the velocity of the governing fluids starts to decrease significantly and the pressure gradient is higher for pure water as compared to single-walled carbon nanotubes due to low density. As the specific heat is very high for pure water as compared to the multi-wall carbon nanotubes, it raises temperature of the muscles, in the case of pure water, as compared to the multi-walled carbon nanotubes. Furthermore, it is noticed that the trapped bolus starts decreasing in size as the buoyancy forces are dominant as compared to viscous forces. This model may be applicable in biomedical engineering and nanotechnology to design the biomedical devices. © 2017, Società Italiana di Fisica and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={In the present work, we report exchange bias tuning by varying thin film deposition parameters such as synthesis method and underlying layer patterning. The patterned substrates for this study were prepared by self-assembly of polystyrene (PS) latex spheres (~530 nm) on Si (100) substrate. The desired magnetic nanocaps composed of CoO/Co bilayer film on these patterned substrates were prepared by molecular beam epitaxy technique under ultra-high vacuum conditions. For this, a Co layer of ~10 nm thickness was deposited on the substrates and then oxidized in-situ to form CoO/Co/PS in-situ oxidized film or ex-situ in ambiance which also gives CoO/Co/PS naturally oxidized film. Simultaneously, reference thin films of Co (~10 nm) were also prepared on plane Si substrate and similar oxidation treatments were performed on them respectively. The magnetic properties studied using SQUID technique revealed higher exchange bias (~1736 Oe) in the in-situ oxidized Co/PS film as compared to that in naturally oxidized Co/PS film (~1544 Oe) and also compared to the reference film. The observed variations in the magnetic properties are explained in terms of surface patterning induced structural changes of the deposited films and different oxidation methods. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

This has necessitated a comprehensive approach in planning the expansion ofthe system with the incorporation of DG units for effective and reliable operation of the system. In this study, a robustHybrid Islanding Detection Technique (HIDT) has been proposed for identifying the islanding event early and accuratelyin the distribution networks with DGs installed by a two-step Genetic Algorithm (GA) process. As the reliability ofpower supply to the customer is of utmost importance, a priority-based load shedding scheme is proposed. Theproposed load shedding scheme sheds only the vulnerable loads in the island for regaining the frequency and voltagestabilities. By the proposed methods, a comprehensive solution for system planning and emergency control actionscan be obtained for effective operation of the system with DG units. The proposed methods are investigated onstandard IEEE 33 and 69 bus distribution systems under different loading conditions. The results obtained show thatthe proposed methods are able to identify the islanding event more effectively and also regain the stability in theisland with less amount of load shedding. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2016.},

For the most part, Brushless DC motors have been utilized as a part of different modern and local applications due to its favorable characteristics such as straightforward structure, extensive torque, long utilize time, great speed regulation. However the BLDC motor frameworks have questionable and nonlinear attributes which corrupt execution of controllers. Sliding mode controllers (SMC) are very useful in controlling the non-linearities in the system. But due to the effect of chattering in SMC based drives, the use of controller is limited. Henceforth a novel hybrid fuzzy sliding mode controller is exhibited in this paper for effectively reducing the chattering effect.

abstract={Effort estimation plays a pivotal role for planning the development of any software applications. When there is a need of developing web-based applications, the need of proper estimation of its effort is considered to be very essential. Web-based software projects are different than conventional projects, and hence the task of estimation is a complex one. It is observed that the literature does not provide a guidance to the analysts to use a particular model for effort estimation of this type of applications. A number of models like IFPUG Function Point Model, NESMA, MARK-II, etc. are being considered for effort estimation of web-based applications. The efficiency of these models can be improved by employing certain intelligent techniques on them. This study considers the application of various machine learning techniques such as K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Constrained Topological Mapping (CTM), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) and Classification and Regression Tree (CART) for effort estimation of web-based applications using IFPUG Function Point approach. The ISBSG dataset, Release 12 has been considered in this study for obtaining the IFPUG Function Point data. The effectiveness of these machine learning techniques-based effort estimation models is assessed with the help of certain metrics, in order to evaluate performance of desired web-based applications. © 2017 ACM.},

Energy bands and density of states (DOS) computations are performed using different flavors of exchange and correlations. The calculations are performed using Wu-Cohen generalized gradient approximation (WC-GGA), Perdew et al. (PBE-sol) and the most accurate modified Becke and Johnson (mBJ) potentials. Our investigations show that energy bands and DOS computed using mBJ potential are in better agreement with the available experimental data. Optical properties such as, dielectric tensor components, absorption spectra, reflectivity, refractivity, dielectric loss, are investigated using mBJ potential. Imaginary peaks of di-electric tensor ε2(ω), are interpreted by means of inter-band transitions from valence to conduction band. High intensity absorption curves from 3 to 5 eV, energy band gap depicted for ZnGa2Te4 (1.61 eV) and CdGa2Te4 (1.78 eV) materials indicates their applicability for solar photovoltaic and other optoelectronic applications. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This paper presents an analytical study of magnetohydrodynamics and convective heat transfer of nanofluids synthesized by three different shaped (brick, platelet and cylinder) silver (Ag) nanoparticles in water. A two-phase nanoscale formulation is adopted which is more appropriate for biophysical systems. The flow is induced by metachronal beating of cilia and the flow geometry is considered as a cylindrical tube. The analysis is carried out under the low Reynolds number and long wavelength approximations and the fluid and cilia dynamics is of the creeping type. A Lorentzian magnetic body force model is employed and magnetic induction effects are neglected. Solutions to the transformed boundary value problem are obtained via numerical integration. The influence of cilia length parameter, Hartmann (magnetic) number, heat absorption parameter, Grashof number (free convection), solid nanoparticle volume fraction, and cilia eccentricity parameter on the flow and heat transfer characteristics (including effective thermal conductivity of the nanofluid) are examined in detail. Furthermore a comparative study for different nanoparticle geometries (i.e. bricks, platelets and cylinders) is conducted. The computations show that pressure increases with enhancing the heat absorption, buoyancy force (i.e. Grashof number) and nanoparticle fraction however it reduces with increasing the magnetic field. The computations also reveal that pressure enhancement is a maximum for the platelet nano-particle case compared with the brick and cylinder nanoparticle cases. Furthermore the quantity of trapped streamlines for cylinder type nanoparticles exceeds substantially that computed for brick and platelet nanoparticles, whereas the bolus magnitude (trapped zone) for brick nanoparticles is demonstrably greater than that obtained for cylinder and platelet nanoparticles. The present model is applicable in biological and biomimetic transport phenomena exploiting magnetic nanofluids and ciliated inner tube surfaces. © 2016 The Society of Powder Technology Japan},

LPS is the most developed Lean Construction tool used in improving work plans and control of projects. The work described in this paper presents results of an ongoing construction project in closing phase. It focuses on contractor's implementation of LPS to analyze how lean construction techniques improve performance and productivity. To achieve this, action research model was undertaken. The research was carried out in a Bishop Heber college construction site, where multipurpose buildings were being constructed by a sole contractor. A comparison-based survey was conducted with construction professionals to identify current practices and exposure LPS has in India. The results reveal that implementing LPS had significant improvements over traditional management and a notable increase in average Percentage Plan Completed. This progress was enabled by the way the site was planned, managed and controlled using LPS. The paper concludes by discussing ing results of implementing LPS, including benefits, barriers, and the critical success factors for this project. However, there were some potential barriers reported which hinder the achieving full potential of LPS. © IAEME Publication.},

Among such nano clusters, the compound formed between Cu-Ag has gained considerable interest because of their unique optical, electronic and magnetic properties. Density functional theory (DFT) is one of the most popular techniques of quantum mechanics to study the electronic properties of materials. Conceptual DFT-based descriptors are indispensable tools to correlate the experimental properties of nano compounds and composites. In this report, we have studied CuAgn; (n = 1-8) nano alloy clusters within theoretical framework of DFT at B3LYP level. The calculated nano alloy clusters show interesting odd-even oscillation behaviors, indicating even number of clusters show higher stability as compare to their neighbor odd number clusters.

abstract={In recent years, major industrial sectors such as automotive, aerospace, building, biomedical, and others have increasingly been employing polymer composites for structural applications, but these polymers are known to exhibit poor adhesion characteristics owing to their low surface free energy (SFE) and lack of polar functional groups on their surfaces. This chapter discusses the effect of modifying polymer surfaces by different plasma techniques on the SFE and surface roughness of the polymers, which play an important role in improving adhesive bond strength. This chapter highlights the importance of plasma for surface activation of polymer composites to form structural parts using adhesive bonding for high-end applications. The chapter is divided into five sections. Section 3.1 gives an introduction to the chapter. Section 3.2 gives a brief summary of the adhesives being used for high-end applications. Section 3.3 gives a detailed overview of the adhesion phenomenon, its mechanisms, wetting, adhesion in polymer systems, and the need for surface modification. Section 3.4 outlines the different types of surface modification techniques, their advantages, and disadvantages. Section 3.5 gives a detailed overview of the effects of plasma on the physicochemical properties of polymer composites by characterizing the plasma-treated samples. © 2018 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Some standard values of Schmidt number like Hydrogen(0.22), Helium(0.30), Amonia(0.78); Eckert number (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2) and Prandtl number for water(0.71) and Air(7.0) was considered in this paper. The effects of pertinent physical fluid parameter like porosity, viscosity ratio, density ratio etc. on velocity, temperature and concentration distribution are considered and demonstrated through graphs. Heavier diffusive species and high molecular diffusivity ratio decreases the fluid concentration throughout the region. Increasing values of Prandtl number upsurge the fluid temperature throughout the region. © 2017 ANAME Publication. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In many industrial situations, machines are subjected to random breakdowns. In this paper, we consider the asynchronous vacation policy for the multi-server machine repair problem with server breakdown and two types of spares. According to this policy, when a certain number of servers become idle at a service completion instant, the servers will take an asynchronous vacation of random length together. If the servers find no waiting failed unit in the system and the number of servers on vacation is less than the total number of servers, then these servers can take vacation individually and continue to take vacation if the vacation condition is satisfied. Each server is subject to breakdowns in working state only and can be repaired according to exponential service time distribution. Matrix geometric method is used to obtain the queue size distribution. Various performance measures viz. the expected number of the idle servers, busy servers and vacationing servers, etc. are determined. The sensitivity analysis is made to examine the effect of parameters on various performance measures. Copyright © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={In this paper, the optoelectronic nature of the CdGa2 X4 (X = S, Se) solar cell materials are examined using full potential linear augmented plane wave (FP-LAPW) method as embodied in WIEN2K code. In present computation, we have used most suitable modified Backe-Johnson (mBJ) potential under the framework of density functional theory (DFT). The calculated electronic properties like energy band structure and density of states spectra show that these materials exhibit a direct band gap (Γ–Γ) result of 3.22 eV and 2.36 eV for CdGa2 S4 and CdGa2 Se4 compounds, respectively. Absorption spectra for CdGa2 X4 (X = S, Se) compounds have been studied and it has been found that above the band gap, absorption are taking place and it covers wide visible spectrum energy range. On the basis of calculated band gap, density of states and absorption coefficient spectra, it is found that these compounds can be suitably applicable in optoelectronic devices such as solar cell.

abstract={Analytical solutions are developed for the electro-kinetic flow of a viscoelastic biological liquid in a finite length cylindrical capillary geometry under peristaltic waves. The Jefferys’ non-Newtonian constitutive model is employed to characterize rheological properties of the fluid. The unsteady conservation equations for mass and momentum with electro-kinetic and Darcian porous medium drag force terms are reduced to a system of steady linearized conservation equations in an axisymmetric coordinate system. The long wavelength, creeping (low Reynolds number) and Debye–Hückel linearization approximations are utilized. The resulting boundary value problem is shown to be controlled by a number of parameters including the electro-osmotic parameter, Helmholtz–Smoluchowski velocity (maximum electro-osmotic velocity), and Jefferys’ first parameter (ratio of relaxation and retardation time), wave amplitude. The influence of these parameters and also time on axial velocity, pressure difference, maximum volumetric flow rate and streamline distributions (for elucidating trapping phenomena) is visualized graphically and interpreted in detail. Pressure difference magnitudes are enhanced consistently with both increasing electro-osmotic parameter and Helmholtz–Smoluchowski velocity, whereas they are only elevated with increasing Jefferys’ first parameter for positive volumetric flow rates. Maximum time averaged flow rate is enhanced with increasing electro-osmotic parameter, Helmholtz–Smoluchowski velocity and Jefferys’ first parameter. Axial flow is accelerated in the core (plug) region of the conduit with greater values of electro-osmotic parameter and Helmholtz–Smoluchowski velocity whereas it is significantly decelerated with increasing Jefferys’ first parameter. The simulations find applications in electro-osmotic (EO) transport processes in capillary physiology and also bio-inspired EO pump devices in chemical and aerospace engineering. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={An analytical investigation is presented to study the unsteady peristaltic transport of nanofluids. Three different geometries of nanoparticle viz bricks, cylinder and platelets are considered in our analysis. The flow geometry is taken as nonuniform channel of finite length to explore our model for wide range of biomedical applications. Exact solutions are obtained for the non-dimensional governing equations subject to physically realistic boundary conditions. The effects of nanoparticle shapes on effective thermal conductivity, axial velocity, transverse velocity, temperature, and pressure difference distributions along the length of non-uniform channel with variation of different flow parameters are discussed with the help of graphical illustrations. It is observed that platelet shaped nanoparticles carry maximum velocity whereas brick shaped nanoparticles are the best to enhance the thermal conductivity. An inherent property of peristaltic transport i.e. trapping is also discussed. This model is applicable in drugs delivery system where different geometries of drugs are delivered and it is also applicable to design a microperistaltic pump for transportation of nanofluids. © 2017 The Authors},

In this paper, first a single layer convexo-concave patch antenna with a concave bow tie slot is designed and analyzed. Then a superstrate layer is introduced with this antenna. A comparative study between the single layer and multilayer convexo-concave patch antenna is done and it is observed that after the application of a superstrate layer with alteration of dielectric substrate the antenna resonates at two different frequencies 3.17 GHz and 5.34 GHz with a bandwidth of 7% and 17% respectively. © 2016 IEEE.},

In addition, the optimized sensor showed excellent selectivity towards Cu(II) and Zn(II) ions with fluorescence “turn off” and “turn on” modes respectively. Along with this, anion recognition studies were carried out using UV-visible and fluorescence spectrophotometric titrations which revealed that synthesized sensors also exhibit selective sensing of F−, CH3COO− and H2PO4 − ions via H-bond interaction and subsequent deprotonation to elicit distinct visual color change from light yellow to orange with significant quenching in its emission intensity. Furthermore, the in-situ prepared sensor-anion adduct solution exhibited colorimetric “On-Off” sensing of Cu(II) and Zn(II) ions, which was confirmed through UV-visible titration experiments. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

abstract={The inventive use of language in different areas by humans makes them creative and innovative. The use of innovative language in advertisements is to hold the attention of consumers and to motivate them to purchase different products. They (advertisers) use different and updated language techniques in advertising; one of them is code mixing (CM), which refers to the mixing of words from different languages in a systematic pattern. This paper intended to provide the role and impact of code • mixing in advertising in India through the interviews conducted from 100 individuals. This will result in understanding the concept of code - mixing from the perspective of 'global advertising strategy'. Additionally, it would help in understanding the cultural identities of other regions and 'social responsibilities'. The results obtained from lexical analysis of code mixed advertisements and readers' attitudinal surveys showed that the linguistic factors of advertisements are designed keeping multilingual reader's psychology in mind. Advertisers strategically utilize their linguistic creativity by including different symbolic meanings in their creative linguistic repertoire. It helps in keeping the product memorable. In order to fulfil the purpose of the study, quantitative approach was used to check whether code mixing in advertisements works as a successful language strategy in having imprints on consumers' minds. The paper provides new explanations using exploratory and descriptive analysis that would be helpful as an evidence to enhance the quality of communication in marketing.

abstract={Indian Railways (IR) which is a vertically integrated organization under Ministry of Railways is in urgent need of reforms. It has been discussed since long that the current organizational structure of IR is a major deterrent for its commercial orientation, promoting competition and providing a level playing field to other players in the sector. As a result, private investments in the sector have been negligible in spite of several attempts made by the Ministry of Railways. Indian policy makers have been apprehensive about vertical unbundling citing negative experiences from British Railways. The authors believe that given the framework that vertical unbundling provides for leveraging private investments and operational efficiencies, it should be explored as an option for IR. This paper is an attempt in this direction wherein the unbundling of policy making, infrastructure and services is explored. Authors have studied the German Railway Reform in depth and explored the implications of similar unbundling for IR.},

abstract={The present article studies theoretically the electrokinetic pumping of nanofluids with heat and mass transfer in a micro-channel under peristaltic waves, a topic of some interest in medical nano-scale electro-osmotic devices. The microchannel walls are deformable and transmit periodic waves. The Chakraborty-Roy nanofluid electrokinetic formulation is adopted in which Joule heating effects are incorporated. Soret and Dufour cross-diffusion effects are also considered. Under low Reynolds number (negligible inertial effects), long wavelength and Debye linearization approximations, the governing partial differential equations for mass, momentum, energy and solute concentration conservation are derived with appropriate boundary conditions at the micro-channel walls. The merging model features a number of important thermo-physical, electrical and nanoscale parameter, namely thermal and solutal Grashof numbers, the Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity (maximum electro-osmotic velocity) and Joule heating to surface heat flux ratio. Closed-form solutions are derived for the solute concentration, temperature, axial velocity, averaged volumetric flow rate, pressure difference across one wavelength, and stream function distribution in the wave frame. Additionally expressions are presented for the surface shear stress function at the wall (skin friction coefficient), wall heat transfer rate (Nusselt number) and wall solute mass transfer rate (Sherwood number). The influence of selected parameters on these flow variables is studied with the aid of graphs. Bolus formation is also visualized and analyzed in detail. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

In contrast, the convective surface boundary conditions with the effects of radiation are applied. Design/methodology/approach - The governing partial differential equations are transformed into highly nonlinear coupled ordinary differential equations consisting of the momentum, energy and nanoparticle concentration via suitable similarity transformations, which are then solved the using optimal homotopy analysis method (OHAM) a Mathematica Package BVPh2.0. Findings - The influence of emerging physical flow parameters on fluid velocity component, temperature distribution and nanoparticle concentration are discussed in detail. Also, anOHAM solution demonstrates very good correlation with those obtained in the previously published results. It is noticed that OHAM can overcome the earlier restriction, assumptions and limitation of traditional perturbation method. The main advantage of this method is that OHAM can be applied directly to nonlinear differential equations without using linearization and round-off errors, and therefore, it cannot be affected by error associated to discretization.

abstract={Old engines (Euro III or earlier) produce more emissions, and it will be difficult to entirely stop their usage especially in developing and under-developed nations; hence, it is desired that appropriate emission reduction technologies are tested on such engines to analyze their feasibility and economical acceptability. While most such studies have been conducted on constant speed stationary engines and modern engines, this study tried to analyze the effectiveness of an uncoated wall-flow type ceramic diesel particulate filter on a Euro-I, water-cooled, direct injection, variable speed, compression ignition engine in a laboratory set-up in India. Also, this study focused on diesel particulate filter regeneration by two methods: active regeneration by diesel injection in the particulate filter using an electronic control unit and off-board regeneration by taking out and heating the diesel particulate filter in an electrical resistance furnace at 650 °C for 10 h. The results, in the form of smoke emission, NOx emission and engine performance, obtained using both the regeneration methods were analyzed, and conclusions were drawn. It was found that using diesel particulate filter, particulate matter emissions (smoke) were almost entirely eliminated. It was also found that off-board regeneration had numerous advantages compared to active regeneration. Since a furnace would be needed for off-board regeneration, an exchange process for diesel particulate filter is suggested. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={This paper describes the performance of thermal storage integrated micro-cogeneration system based on single cylinder diesel engine. In addition to electricity generated from genset, waste heat from hot exhaust of diesel engine was used to heat water in a double pipe heat exchanger of 67.70 cm length with inside tube diameter of 3.81 cm and outside tube diameter of 5.08 cm. Additionally, a latent heat thermal energy storage system was also integrated with this cogeneration system. A shell and tube type heat exchanger of 346 mm diameter and 420 mm height with 45 tubes of 18 mm diameter each was designed and fabricated, to store thermal energy, in which Erythritol (C4H10O4) was used as phase changing material. The test results show that micro capacity (4.4 kW), stationary, single cylinder, diesel engine can be successfully utilized to simultaneously produce power as well as heating, and to also store thermal energy. Slight decrease in engine performance was observed when double pipe heat exchanger and latent heat thermal energy storage system was integrated with engine but the amount of energy which could be recovered was significant.

abstract={Necessity of opening of energy gap in the band structure of, otherwise a zero gap semiconductor, graphene, is a must for its use in fabrication of high speed electronic devices. One such technique, for opening of energy gap in graphene, is by way of doping the pristine graphene with boron or nitrogen. Besides many important applications, to which B- and N-doped graphene has been put, the one very important for solving the global energy crisis is by way of its capacity for hydrogen storage. In this paper electronic structure of B- and N-doped graphene has been studied by using Density Functional Theory, as implemented in WIEN2K code. PBE-GGA (Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof 96) pseudo-potential is used for solving the Schrodinger equation in self-consistent manner and to account for the exchange and correlation effects through the use of Generalized Gradient Approximation. The band structure calculations reveal that whereas a band gap opens at the symmetry point K both for B- and N-doped graphene, the center of the gap (i.e., the Dirac point in pristine graphene) is shifted above the Fermi level by about 2.20 eV for B-doped graphene, and shifted down the Fermi level by about the same amount for N-doped graphene, when the doping level was kept 25% in each case. The energy gap opened was found to be about 0.30 eV for B-doped graphene and 0.45 eV for N-doped graphene. The linear dispersion characteristics obtained at Dirac point for pristine graphene, almost vanish for B-/N-doped graphene, due to symmetry breaking and opening of energy gap. The band structure and Density of States of B-/N-doped graphene are found also to depend on the choice of cell parameters. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This paper presents a novel frequency reconfigurable monopole antenna that has switchable notch characteristic at center frequency of 5.3 GHz. The proposed antenna consists of a defective ground structure (DGS) to enhance the impedance bandwidth from 3.17 to 13 GHz. The F-shaped parasitic element with three stubs (two vertical and one horizontal) are located on the back side of the radiating patch to achieve the band rejection characteristics from 4.9 GHz to 5.7 GHz. The metallic ground plane structure is connected or disconnected to the F-shaped parasitic element through stubs by means of p-i-n diodes. Experimental demonstration of applications of the proposed antenna structure as 5.3 GHz notched band ultra-wideband (UWB) antenna with all diodes in the OFF-state and as 5.3 GHz radiator for wireless local area network (WLAN) with all diodes in the ON-state is reported. In both the cases, good agreements between measured and simulated return losses, radiation patterns and realized gains are observed. © 2017, Electromagnetics Academy. All rights reserved.},

Therefore, to detect and classify the plant disease at an early stage is a significant task for agriculture engineering. This paper proposes an algorithm to diagnosis the diseased leaf using Weiner filtering with different window size i.e. n=10, 20, 30 out of which n=20 gives better detection efficiency and adaptive histogram equalization is used to remove background noise. Different edge detection techniques were used to detect the edges of infected and healthy leaf parts in which canny gives 80-99% of accuracy. The present approach is used to analyze the diseased leaf at initial stage to initiate necessary precautions that can be taken in time to minimize the yield losses. © 2017, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.

abstract={Sludge reduction by physico-chemical methods results in the buildup of chemicals, which may require further treatment. Owing these reasons various biologically sustainable methods of sludge reduction including the application of high oxygenation have been successfully tested. Experiments on actual sewage in two lab-scale sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) were conducted under normal (1.5–2.5 mgDO/L) and high dissolved oxygen (DO) (HDO: 3–6.5 mgDO/L) regimes. It was observed that microorganism allocated substrate between maintenance and growth in the form of maintenance coefficient. Which could be induced by endogenous respiration owing to high solids retention time (SRT), predation on bacteria, chemical toxicity, adverse environment, and viral attack on bacteria. The wastewater treatment process may experience one or more maintenance inducing factors; nevertheless, high SRT and prevailing environmental conditions are imminent and thus considered as primary maintenance (mp), while remaining are classified as secondary maintenance (ms). Average yield coefficient reduction at HDO was 32.7% and 28.2% compared to stoichiometric and at normal DO, respectively. The observed primary and secondary maintenance was 0.11gCOD/gVSS.d (±0.01) at an SRT of 25.2 d (±2.0) and 0.096 g 0.1 gCOD/gVSS.d (±0.045) at an SRT of 24.2 d (±3.6d), respectively. The results obtained under the study are not as precise as on pure culture and defined substrate, nevertheless, it gives an idea that how stress factors inducing maintenance need to be addressed more seriously and objectively while managing our efforts on sludge reduction. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

A single repair facility inspect the original and degraded unit upon failure to check the feasibility of repair. The repair facility may fail during maintenance, repair and inspection and undergoes for treatment with Weibull probability density function. The unit after repair becomes degraded. Switch devices are perfect. All random variables like repair time, failure time, inspection time and treatment rate are independent and statistically independent. For the analysis of the system various measures of system effectiveness are obtained by using semi-Markov processes and regenerative point technique. With the help of numerical and graphical results for MTSF, availability and profit functions it is concluded that present system is more reliable, available and profitable, when random variables have less vale of shape parameters.},

abstract={India is a country where major part of its population lives in rural area and majority of rural people are deprived from the very basic amenities. There are approximately 900 villages in Mathura district. These villages are not in very good condition and do not cater to the basic needs of villages i.e. education, healthcare, employment etc. The aim of this article to demonstrate through various developmental proposals that village can be self-contained in itself by understanding & identifying the potential of that place. For the demonstration of sustainable development, village sameri of Mathura district has been taken up. The main aim of this project is to upgrade built environment of village and living conditions of villagers which include the socio-economic well-being, livable atmosphere, educational up liftment and societal integrity of the people living in the village. It is intended to show various stages of village development without degrading the environment. The article is divided into three sections: familiarization with the place, identification of issues and finally typical proposals which can also be adopted in other villages of Mathura district. The last section of conclusion and recommendation is not merely based upon theoretical study but detail surveys which were carried out by subsequent visit to the village. It is hoped that this little work will contribute in some measures to serve the society and nation. © 2016 IEEE.},

Conventional Z-Source breaker (ZSB) topologies can provide protection for unidirectional power flow. Proposed topologies of bi-directional ZSB (Bi-ZSB) and bi-directional ZSB with coupled inductor (Bi-CZSB) can clear the fault in either direction of power flow. Both topologies utilize a SCR as a switch to instantly isolate the fault from source. No sensing and detection of fault is required. For second topology, mutual inductance is used for SCR commutation. Coupled inductors help to reduce size of inductors, cost and also eliminate the need of additional Z-Source breaker capacitor. Performance of both topologies is verified in MATLAB and validated on laboratory prototype. © 2016 IEEE.},

Such approach incorporates the value of trust to ensure desired customer retention. The procedure further intensifies when an organizational approach emphasize effective complaint handling system within its service protocol. Based on this established relationship, this study explores the viability of the framework in the presence of customer complain intention categories with Indian context. Data for this descriptive study are collected using a structured questionnaire from 450 respondents. Out of the three types of complainants (consumer complaint intention), voice complaint intention appeared as the strongest determinant of consumer trust and retention as compared to private and third party complaint intention. On providing complaint handling, the strength of the relationship improved to the greatest extent for private complaint intention while there was no effect of complaint handling for voice complaint intention. Results of the study highlight as to what extent complaint handling matters for different types of complainants (voice, private and third party). Such practices can help the retailers distinguish and accordingly handle various types of complainants. Effective complaint handling practices can make the complainants more trustworthy and loyal than before. © 2016, © 2016 Management Development Institute.},

abstract={Background: Eco-friendly synthesis of nanoparticles is viewed as an alternative to the chemical method and initiated the use of microorganisms for synthesis. The present study has been designed to utilize plant pathogenic fungi Sclerotinia sclerotiorum MTCC 8785 strain for synthesis and optimization of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) production as well as evaluation of antibacterial properties. The AgNPs were synthesized by reduction of aqueous silver nitrate (AgNO3) solution after incubation of 3–5 days at room temperature. The AgNPs were further characterized using UV–visible spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Reaction parameters including media, fungal biomass, AgNO3 concentration, pH and temperature were further optimized for rapid AgNPs production. The antibacterial efficacy of AgNPs was evaluated against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 by disc diffusion and growth kinetics assay at the concentration determined by the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Results: AgNPs synthesis was initially marked by the change in colour from pale white to brown and was confirmed by UV–Vis spectroscopy. Optimization studies showed that potato dextrose broth (PDB) media, 10 g of biomass, addition of 2 mM AgNO3, pH 11 and 80 °C temperature resulted in enhanced AgNPs synthesis through extracellular route. TEM data revealed spherical shape AgNPs with size in the range of 10 nm. Presence of proteins capped to AgNPs was confirmed by FTIR. AgNPs showed antibacterial activity against E. coli and S. aureus at 100 ppm concentration, corresponding MIC value. Conclusion: S. sclerotiorum MTCC 8785 mediated AgNPs was synthesized rapidly under optimized conditions, which showed antibacterial activity. © 2016, The Author(s).},

abstract={This paper aims to open a new vista of research in the direction of possible application of power electronics DC-DC converters in analog chaotic communication. Most of the work reported on analog chaotic communication is based on the pioneer work of Pecora and Caroll, with synchronization between transmitter and receiver. Receiver based on synchronization, also known as coherent receiver, has a disadvantage of parameter mismatch and is sensitive to noise. In the present work, firstly, a secure transmitter using chaotic DC-DC converters is proposed that encrypts information using chaotic switching map technique. In chaotic switching map technique, the message is encrypted by randomly switching from one chaotic converter to another. The bifurcation parameter of the randomly switched chaotic converter is modulated by the message. Secondly, an attempt has been made to design a robust non-coherent receiver that is adaptable to the switching chaotic transmitters, even in the presence of noise. Once the receiver identifies the chaotic converter, it can decode the message as per the decryption algorithm. With the proposed non-coherent receiver, the disadvantages of coherent receivers can be overcome. We have also devised a prototype smart meter, used in smart distribution grid for implementing the proposed communication technique. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

abstract={This paper explores how technological advances can help in better diagnosis of cancer affected region of the brain. There has been exponential increase in brain tumor cases in recent pasts and there has been a gap in existing technology for root cause analysis. New reports indicate that various brain tumors can be treated through surgery and in exceptional cases with radiation. Image segmentation provides huge potential in diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors. Image segmentation helps to find volume and growth of tumor with usage of techniques such as human edge correction, outer edge coloring and inter active thresholds holdings. There is critical requirement to find out an automatic or semi automatic method for classification of brain tumor images, to eliminate human error and provide accurate results in MRI images. A new approach 'LSF HYBRID model' has been developed for detention and classification of brain cancer. System dependant actions such mechanisms leverage To locate the block and classify the brain tumor, this LSF HYBRID method users system dependant actions. It also utilizes other mechanisms such as Image enhancement, segmentation and Equalization of histogram. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Multidrug resistance of the pathogenic microorganisms to the antimicrobial drugs has become a major impediment toward successful diagnosis and management of infectious diseases. Recent advancements in nanotechnology-based medicines have opened new horizons for combating multidrug resistance in microorganisms. In particular, the use of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) as a potent antibacterial agent has received much attention. The most critical physico-chemical parameters that affect the antimicrobial potential of AgNPs include size, shape, surface charge, concentration and colloidal state. AgNPs exhibits their antimicrobial potential through multifaceted mechanisms. AgNPs adhesion to microbial cells, penetration inside the cells, ROS and free radical generation, and modulation of microbial signal transduction pathways have been recognized as the most prominent modes of antimicrobial action. On the other side, AgNPs exposure to human cells induces cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, and inflammatory response in human cells in a cell-type dependent manner. This has raised concerns regarding use of AgNPs in therapeutics and drug delivery. We have summarized the emerging endeavors that address current challenges in relation to safe use of AgNPs in therapeutics and drug delivery platforms. Based on research done so far, we believe that AgNPs can be engineered so as to increase their efficacy, stability, specificity, biosafety and biocompatibility. In this regard, three perspectives research directions have been suggested that include (1) synthesizing AgNPs with controlled physico-chemical properties, (2) examining microbial development of resistance toward AgNPs, and (3) ascertaining the susceptibility of cytoxicity, genotoxicity, and inflammatory response to human cells upon AgNPs exposure. © 2016 Dakal, Kumar, Majumdar and Yadav.},

abstract={The recognition of handwritten similar shape characters are still a challenging problem in HOCR system. Almost entire scripts are suffering with this kind of problem. This manuscript is considered the similar shape character problem in Devanagari script. An algorithm is proposed first to estimate the similar character pairs in Devanagari Script and 7 pairs are identified by investigating the confusion matrix. Similar shape characters have very minor difference in shape that's why at the time of recognition (classification) phase, classifier is being confused with another similar shape characters. This problem can be solved by estimate that minor difference called critical region in the similar shape characters and used critical region to extract the more features before classification phase. The critical region is estimated by Fisher discrimination function. A new kind of masking techniques used to extract the features from ISIDCHAR (standard Devanagari database) and 96.58 % recognition rate is obtained finally after getting the 81.94% improvement in similar character recognition. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Effort estimation techniques play a crucial role in planning of the development of web-based applications. Web-based software projects, considered in the present-day scenario are different from conventional object oriented projects, and hence the task of effort estimation is a complex one. It is observed that the literature do not provide a guidance to the analysts to use a particular model as being the most suitable one, for effort estimation of web-based applications. A number of models like IFPUG Function Point Model, NESMA, MARK-II, etc. are being considered for web effort estimation purpose. The efficiency of these models can be improved by employing certain intelligent techniques on them. Keeping in mind the end goal to enhance the efficiency of evaluating the effort required to develop web-based application, certain machine learning techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Boosting and Support Vector Regression Kernels are considered in this study for effort estimation of web-based applications using IFPUG Function Point approach. The ISBSG dataset, Release 12 has been considered in this study for obtaining the IFPUG Function Point data. The performance effort estimation models based on various machine learning techniques is assessed with the help of certain metrics, in order to examine them critically. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Transition metal substituted Titanium oxide (TiO2) has drawn a great deal of attention due to its excellent properties like solar cell as an EHP generator, physical properties which makes it suitable for various thin film applications i.e., in photo catalysis, Solar cell and gas sensor. When irradiated with UV light, TiO2 nanosized powder shows strong Oxidizability and reducibility. Ti0.9Mn0.05Fe0.05O2 sample synthesis was carried out by Solgel wet chemical precipitation route at temperature 350 °C. The crystallinity and the structure of doped TiO2 is determined by X-ray diffraction using Cu–Kα radiations operated at 40 kV and 35 mA in the range of 20° to 80°. The pattern gets indexed in Tetragonal structure and confirms the single phase material with no impurity. The morphological analysis of the sample is carried out by Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements. TEM image shows the irregular shape of the nanoparticles and particle size lies in the range of 75–125 nm. In the FT-IR spectrum of Ti0.9Mn0.05Fe0.05O2, the peak at 715.44 cm−1 shows bending and stretching mode of vibration of Ti–O and peaks at 1399.91 cm−1 shows stretching vibration of Ti–O–Ti. © 2016 American Scientific Publishers.

abstract={Over the past few years, designing of progressive visual recovery technique has been studied by many researchers. Previous research on PVC were all carrying pixel-expansion problem. Young et al. (2013) suggested a new dimension of Progressive visual secret sharing with the feature of Block based encoding and recovery of an original secret. In the Young scheme (2013), a secret image is subdivided into n non-overlapped image sections. When L (2 ≤ L ≤ n) participants stack their shadow images, all the image sections associated with these L participants will be recovered. In this article, the scheme suggested for a block based progressive scheme is critically analyzed and we show that leakage of secret information is possible in the scheme during the encoding process of the shares. Further, we propose a new robust progressive algorithm based on the logistic chaotic map to overcome the said limitation. The irregular outputs of the logistic map are used to encode a secret digital image. To provide robustness during the encoding process of the share, noise has been introduced along with chaotic sequences. The performance of the algorithm in the scheme of Young is critically analyzed and compared with the new suggested scheme. The empirical results are presented to showcase the performance of our proposed scheme in terms of its effectiveness and feasibility. © 2016 Taru Publications.},

abstract={Background and objectives With ongoing interest in CNT nanofluids and materials in biotechnology, energy and environment, microelectronics, composite materials etc., the current investigation is carried out to analyze the effects of variable viscosity and thermal conductivity of CNT nanofluids flow driven by cilia induced movement through a circular cylindrical tube. Metachronal wave is generated by the beating of cilia and mathematically modeled as elliptical wave propagation by Blake (1971). Methods, results and conclusions The problem is formulated in the form of nonlinear partial differential equations, which are simplified by using the dimensional analysis to avoid the complicacy of dimensional homogeneity. Lubrication theory is employed to linearize the governing equations and it is also physically appropriate for cilia movement. Analytical solutions for velocity, temperature and pressure gradient and stream function are obtained. The analytical results are numerically simulated by using the Mathematica Software and plotted the graphs for velocity profile, temperature profile, pressure gradient and stream lines for better discussion and visualization.

abstract={A theoretical investigation of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flow and heat transfer of electrically-conducting viscoplastic fluids through a channel is conducted. The robust Casson model is implemented to simulate viscoplastic behavior of fluids. The external magnetic field is oblique to the fluid flow direction. Viscous dissipation effects are included. The flow is controlled by the metachronal wave propagation generated by cilia beating on the inner walls of the channel. The mathematical formulation is based on deformation in longitudinal and transverse velocity components induced by the ciliary beating phenomenon with cilia assumed to follow elliptic trajectories. The model also features velocity and thermal slip boundary conditions. Closed-form solutions to the non-dimensional boundary value problem are obtained under physiological limitations of low Reynolds number and large wavelength. The influence of key hydrodynamic and thermo-physical parameters i.e. Hartmann (magnetic) number, Casson (viscoplastic) fluid parameter, thermal slip parameter and velocity slip parameter on flow characteristics are investigated. A comparative study is also made with Newtonian fluids (corresponding to massive values of plastic viscosity). Stream lines are plotted to visualize trapping phenomenon. The computations reveal that velocity increases with increasing the magnitude of Hartmann number near the channel walls whereas in the core flow region (center of the channel) significant deceleration is observed. Temperature is elevated with greater Casson parameter, Hartmann number, velocity slip, eccentricity parameter, thermal slip and also Brinkmann (dissipation) number. Furthermore greater Casson parameter is found to elevate the quantity and size of the trapped bolus. In the pumping region, the pressure rise is reduced with greater Hartmann number, velocity slip, and wave number whereas it is enhanced with greater cilia length. © 2016 IAA.},

The high value of regression coefficient between global softness and HOMO-LUMO gap supports and validates our predicted model. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The influence of transverse magnetic field on time-dependent peristaltic transport of electrically-conducting fluids through a microchannel under an applied external electric field with induced electric field effect is considered, based on lubrication theory approximations. The electrohydrodynamic (EHD) problem is also simplified under the Debye linearization. Closed-form solutions for the linearized dimensionless boundary value problem are derived. With increasing Hartmann number, the formation of bolus in the regime (associated with trapping) is inhibited up to a critical value of magnetic field. Flow rate, axial velocity and local wall shear stress are strongly decreased with greater Hartmann number whereas pressure difference is enhanced with higher Hartmann number at low time values but reduced with greater elapse in time. With greater electro-osmotic parameter (i.e. smaller Debye length), maximum time-averaged flow rate is enhanced, whereas the axial velocity is reduced. An increase in electrical field parameter (i.e. maximum electro-osmotic velocity) causes an increase in maximum time-averaged flow rate. The simulations find applications in electromagnetic peristaltic micro-pumps in medical engineering and also “smart” fluid pumping systems in nuclear and aerospace industries. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The present study investigates the role of temperature in the formation of multiwalled carbon nanotubes from carbon black using arc discharge technique. Carbon black has been used as precursor to synthesize carbon nanotubes in argon atmosphere. The arc current has been varied from 25 to 40 A in order to study the morphological changes in carbon black as it gets converted to multi walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs).We observed formation ofMWCNTsat an arc current of 25 A; however the recorded temperature data suggested correlation of sustained arc temperature with the nanotube formation rather than the magnitude of current in its absoluteness. Interesting to note is that reported current magnitude in published literature are very high (>40 A) for conversion of carbon black but the present investigation shows that it is possible to convert the carbon black toMWCNTseven at lower current values in case the arc temperature is stabilized and sustained for longer period. Detailed investigations suggested that a sustained stable critical temperature of 1400 °C-1600 °Cis essential for the growth of nanotubes and an unstable arc causing temperature fluctuation from critical temperature value yields very low or no MWCNTs. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Alterations in optical transitions and distortions in wave symmetry in nano-scale QW (quantum well) heterostructures are seen due to external uniaxial strain under different polarizations. This paper reports the anisotropy phenomena and optical gain improvement realized in In0.3Ga0.7As/GaAs0.4Sb0.6 type-II QW-heterostructure (well width = 20 Å) under uniaxial strain in the SWIR (short wave infra red) region. The detailed study of the band structure, wave functions associated with the charge carriers in the respective bands and optical gain under electromagnetic field perturbation is reported. The 6 × 6 diagonal k→·p→ Hamiltonian matrix is evaluated and Luttinger-Kohn model is used for the band structure calculation. Optical gain spectrum in the QW-heterostructure under uniaxial strain along [110] for different polarizations of light is calculated. For a charge carrier injection of 5 × 1012/cm2 the optical gain is ∼1600/cm under input z-polarization, ∼14500/cm under x-polarization and ∼15700/cm under y-polarization without external uniaxial strain applied. A significant improvement in optical gain is observed under uniaxial strain along [110] direction under different input polarizations. Keeping in views its utilization in optoelectronics due its very high optical gain in near-infra-red region in x- or y-polarization mode, such structure can be considered as a novel structure. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In this paper, a mathematical study is conducted of steady incompressible flow of a temperature-dependent viscous nanofluid from a vertical stretching sheet under applied external magnetic field and gravitational body force effects. The Reynolds exponential viscosity model is deployed. Electrically-conducting nanofluids are considered which comprise a suspension of uniform dimension nanoparticles suspended in viscous base fluid. The nanofluid sheet is extended with a linear velocity in the axial direction. The Buonjiornio model is utilized which features Brownian motion and thermophoresis effects. The partial differential equations for mass, momentum, energy and species (nano-particle concentration) are formulated with magnetic body force term. Viscous and Joule dissipation effects are neglected. The emerging nonlinear, coupled, boundary value problem is solved numerically using the Runge–Kutta fourth order method along with a shooting technique. Graphical solutions for velocity, temperature, concentration field, skin friction and Nusselt number are presented. Furthermore stream function plots are also included. Validation with Nakamura's finite difference algorithm is included. Increasing nanofluid viscosity is observed to enhance temperatures and concentrations but to reduce velocity magnitudes. Nusselt number is enhanced with both thermal and species Grashof numbers whereas it is reduced with increasing thermophoresis parameter and Schmidt number. The model is applicable in nano-material manufacturing processes involving extruding sheets. © 2016},

abstract={Magnetic nanofluid technologies are emerging in numerous areas including medicine, lubrication (smart tribology), pharmacology, etc. In this paper, we examine heat diffusion in hydromagnetic nanofluids in a peristaltic system, motivated by applications in medical drug delivery systems and gastric magnetographic monitoring. The mathematical formulation encompasses momentum and heat conservation equations with appropriate boundary conditions for compliant walls. Sophisticated correlations are employed for thermal conductivity of the nanoparticles. The nonlinear boundary value problem is normalized with appropriate variables and closed-form solutions are derived for stream function, pressure gradient and temperature profile. Analytical solutions are evaluated numerically with MATHEMATICA symbolic software. Validation of computations is performed for the nonlinear moving boundary value problem via a Chebyschev spectral collocation method (CSM). A detailed study is performed for the influence of various nanoparticle geometries (bricks, cylinders and platelets). With greater magnetic field, flow velocity is enhanced for platelet nanoparticles whereas it is depressed for brick particles. Temperature is dramatically modified with nanoparticle geometry and greater thermal conductivity is achieved with brick-shaped nanoparticles in the fluid, with implications for optimized medical device systems. © 2016 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={We investigate the velocity slip and thermal slip effects on peristaltically driven thermal transport of nanofluids through the vertical parallel plates under the influence of transverse magnetic field. The wall surface is propagating with sinusoidal wave velocity c. The flow characteristics are governed by the mass, momentum and energy conservation principle. Low Reynolds number and large wavelength approximations are taken into consideration to simplify the non-linear terms. Analytical solutions for axial velocity, temperature field, pressure gradient and stream function are obtained under certain physical boundary conditions. Two types of nanoparticles, SiO2 and Ag, are considered for analysis with water as base fluid. This is the first article in the literature that discusses the SiO2 and Ag nanoparticles for a peristaltic flow with variable viscosity. The effects of physical parameters on velocity, temperature, pressure and trapping are discussed. A comparative study of SiO2 nanofluid, Ag nanofluid and pure water is also presented. This model is applicable in biomedical engineering to make thermal peristaltic pumps and other pumping devices like syringe pumps, etc. It is observed that pressure for pure water is maximum and pressure for Ag nanofluid is minimum. © 2016, Società Italiana di Fisica and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={The human intestinal tract is a long, curved tube constituting the final section of the digestive system in which nutrients and water are mostly absorbed. Motivated by the dynamics of chyme in the intestine, a mathematical model is developed to simulate the associated transport phenomena via peristaltic transport. Rheology of chyme is modelled using the Nakamura-Sawada bi-viscosity non-Newtonian formulation. The intestinal tract is considered as a curved tube geometric model. Low Reynolds number (creeping hydrodynamics) and long wavelength approximations are taken into consideration. Analytical solutions of the moving boundary value problem are derived for velocity field, pressure gradient and pressure rise. Streamline flow visualization is achieved with Mathematica symbolic software. Peristaltic pumping phenomenon and trapping of the bolus are also examined. The influence of curvature parameter, apparent viscosity coefficient (rheological parameter) and volumetric flow rate on flow characteristics is described. Validation of analytical solutions is achieved with a MAPLE17 numerical quadrature algorithm. The work is relevant to improving understanding of gastric hydrodynamics and provides a benchmark for further computational fluid dynamic simulations. © Institution of Mechanical Engineers.},

abstract={The recognition of Indian handwritten languages are attracting the attention of researchers due to wide variation and scope. This manuscript is focus on the Accuracy enhancement of handwritten Devanagari character recognition using background elimination and gray level normalization techniques. Devanagari is a famous and widely used script in India. In last few decades, the gradient based approaches have become a best choice to extract the features from handwritten characters. GLAC (Gradient Local Auto-Correlation) feature extraction technique is used for the experiment. All the experiments have done on standard handwritten Devanagari database (36172) and obtained (95.94%) higher recognition rate. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={Segmentation of characters is one of the major step in OCR system. Devanagari script is a two dimensional form of symbol. It is very inconvenient to treat each form of character as a separate symbol because such combinations are very large in number. Segmentation is a process which separates words into characters. In this paper, we deal with segmentation of offline handwritten document especially touching character segmentation also we have discussed the process involved in touching character segmentation and the problem in those processes with their solution. The proposed method is tested on the database set of 250 handwritten touching characters. Experimental results indicate that the method used correctly segments the touching characters. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={Increasing gap between demand and supply of energy has resulted in raised prices of conventional energy sources, and concern for clean environment has led to increase in use of renewable energy and focus on increased energy efficiency. In context of increased energy efficiency, energy storage and waste heat recovery play an important role as these systems improve overall efficiency of systems. In this study, a latent heat thermal energy storage system (LHTESS) for stationary C.I. engine exhaust heat was developed and integrated with engine. A shell and tube type heat exchanger having 346 mm diameter and 420 mm height with 45 numbers of tubes with 18 mm diameter was developed to store thermal energy, in which Erythritol (C4H10O4) was used as a phase change material. The engine performance and the thermal energy storage system performance parameters such as amount of heat stored, and charging efficiency were evaluated. Slight decrease in the engine performance was observed when latent heat thermal energy storage system was integrated to engine but amount of energy which could be recovered was significant. At a load of 4.4 kW the maximum charging efficiency, recovery efficiency and percentage energy saved was 69.53%, 38% and 11.33% respectively. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The rapid increase in population of India forced people to migrate from rural areas and small towns to metropolitan cities for better employment, education, and, good lifestyle. Major cities of India were industrialized and required more work force in metropolitan cities, leading to uncoordinated and unplanned growth, often termed as urban sprawl. Urban sprawl destroyed the natural resources such as open green space, agricultural land, open water bodies and ground water. In this paper, an attempt has been made to monitor urban sprawl using Shannon's Entropy model, Remote Sensing, and GIS for city Jaipur, India. The changed entropy value during the years 1972-2013 proves more dispersed growth in the city. The built-up area of Jaipur has increased from 40 km2 in 1972 to 400 km2 in 2013. Land use percentage of urban settlement is doubled as compared to the urban population of Jaipur during 1972-2013.

abstract={The optical properties, namely refractive index (RI) studies, are reported on a series of pure and doped poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) in solution form. The PVA solutions were synthesized with 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 wt% of PVA in distilled water followed by doping with Rhodamine B in concentrations ranging from 0.05 wt% to 2 wt%. The absorption spectra show an observable shift in the band edge position towards higher wavelength with increase in PVA wt%. When the dopant molecules are added, the curves are drastically modified with the occurrence of new peaks arising at higher doping concentrations along with change in the bandgap. These effects are prominent for all the concentration of PVA solution. The RI does not change much for low doping wt%. but when dopant is added in higher concentrations, it increases slightly reaching a maximum of ∼1.35 at 2 wt%. It is observed that host polymer properties dominate at low doping while a combination of host polymer and dopant dye properties dominate at higher doping concentrations.

abstract={The interest in applying an external pressure on a nano-heterostructure is to attempt to extract more information about the electronic structure through distortion of the electronic structure. This paper reports the tunability of the optical gain under the high pressure effect in M-shaped type-II In0.70Ga0.30As/GaAs0.40Sb0.60 symmetric lasing nano-heterostructure designed for SWIR generation. In order to simulate the optical gain, the heterostructure has been modeled with the help of six band k.p method. The 6×6 diagonalized k.p Hamiltonian has been solved to evaluate the valence sub-bands (i.e. light and heavy hole energies); and then optical matrix elements and optical gain within TE (Transverse Electric) mode has been calculated. For the injected carrier density of 5×1012/cm2, the optimized optical gain within TE mode is as high as ∼9000/cm at the wavelength of ∼1.95 μm, thus providing a very important alternative material system for the generation of SWIR wavelength region. The application of very high pressure (2, 5 and 8 GPa) on the structure along [110] direction shows that the gain as well as lasing wavelength both approach to higher values. Thus, the structure can be tuned externally by the application of high pressure within the SWIR region. © 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In this paper, a laboratory-based penning plasma discharge source is reported which has been developed in two anode configurations and is able to produce visible and VUV lights simultaneously. The developed source has simultaneous diagnostics facility using Langmuir probe and optical emission spectroscopy. The two anode configurations, namely, double ring and rectangular configurations, have been studied and compared for optimum use of the geometry for efficient light emissions and recording. The plasma is produced using helium gas and admixture of three noble gases including helium, neon, and argon. The source is capable to produce eight spectral lines for pure helium in the VUV range from 20 to 60 nm and total 24 spectral lines covering the wavelength range 20–106 nm for the admixture of gases. The large range of VUV lines is generated from gaseous admixture rather from the sputtered materials. The recorded spectrum shows that the plasma light radiations in both visible and VUV range are larger in double ring configuration than that of the rectangular configurations at the same discharge operating conditions. To clearly understand the difference, the imaging of the discharge using ICCD camera and particle-in-cell simulation using VORPAL have also been carried out. The effect of ion diffusion, metastable collision with the anode wall and the nonlinear effects are correlated to explain the results. © 2016, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

abstract={The observations of combination of Poly (vinyl) alcohol and Coumarin properties in nanocmposite films are reported. The X-ray diffraction measurements reveal nanocrystalline nature of PVA film, which remains nanocrystalline after doping Coumarin but along with PVA peaks, additional peak due to dopant crystallinity is seen. The absorption edge shows a double edge feature, where distinct bandgaps for PVA host and dopant Coumarin are obtained. However at a higher doping wt % of 1 and 2, the absorption is mainly dominated by Coumarin and single absorption edge is observed giving a bandgap equal to that of bulk Coumarin (3.3 eV). The composite formation affects the bonding of host drastically and is seen through the bond modification in FTIR spectra. The results suggest that doping below 2 wt% is advantageous as combination of PVA and Coumarin properties are obtained but at 2 wt %, the properties are dominated by mainly Coumarin and the signature of PVA from optical properties is completely lost. © 2016 Author(s).},

abstract={The effect of annealing on the structural and magnetic properties of Co/Pt multilayers was studied as a function of annealing temperature. The ultrathin layers of Pt and Co were deposited to make [Pt 1nm/Co 1nm]x20 multilayer on Si (100) substrate using MBE technique. The structural, magnetic and electronic properties were recorded using XRD, SQUID and XPS techniques, respectively. M-H loop of as deposited sample shows soft magnetic nature with coercivity value of 350 Oe which increases to 974 Oe in 500°C annealed film. When studied at low temperature (5K), the coercivity of 592 Oe is obtained in the as deposited sample which increases to 1626 Oe after annealing. In addition, as revealed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, modifications in core level and valance band are observed. The observed changes in magnetic and electronic properties are attributed to structural modifications in correlation with the changes in (111) orientation of the films seen by X-ray diffraction. © 2016 Author(s).},

abstract={In the present scenario, there are growing concerns over the potential impacts of bioengineered nanoparticles in the health sector. However, our understanding of how bioengineered nanoparticles may affect organisms within natural ecosystems, lags far behind our rapidly increasing ability to engineer novel nanoparticles. To date, research on the biological impacts of bioengineered nanoparticles has primarily consisted of controlled lab studies of model organisms with single species in culture media. Here, we described a cost effective and environment friendly technique for green synthesis of silver nanoparticles. Silver nanoparticles were successfully synthesized from 1?mM AgNO3 via a green synthesis process using leaf extract as reducing as well as capping agent. Nanoparticles were characterized with the help of UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and TEM analysis which revealed the size of nanoparticles of 30-40?nm size. Further the nanoparticles synthesized by green route are found highly toxic against pathogenic bacteria and plant pathogenic fungi viz. Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas syringae and Sclerotiniasclerotiorum. The most important outcome of this work will be the development of value-Added products and protection of human health from pathogens viz., bacteria, virus, fungi etc. © 2016 Author(s).},

abstract={Using titanium isopropoxide as the precursor, Titanium dioxide (TiO2) powder was synthesized via sol-gel method, a promising low temperature route for preparing nanosized metal oxide semiconductors with good homogeneity at low cost. The as-prepared nano powder was thermally treated in air at 550, 650, 750, 900 and 1100°C for 1hr after drying at room temperature and used for further characterization. X-ray diffraction measurements showed that the annealing treatment has a strong impact on the crystal phase of TiO2 samples. The crystallite size as calculated from Debye Scherer formula lies in the range 29-69?nm and is found to increase with increase in annealing temperature. Photoluminescence studies exhibit an improvement in the optical efficiency of the samples with post synthesis heat treatment.

abstract={In the present paper, important experimental findings and their impact on physical properties of Si/Ge systems are presented with the focus on structural and electronic properties investigations also covering band gap engineering. The use of synchrotron radiation based valence band photoemission spectroscopy technique has been demonstrated which provides the variation in bandgap values as a function of annealing on [Si/Ge]x10 multilayers structure. For this purpose, the required VB offsets are obtained by considering the corresponding VB maximum of as prepared sample as a reference. The bandgap values thus obtained show a gradually decreasing pattern with increasing temperature, which is discussed in terms of the effect of various factors such as: (i) quantum confinement effect normally observed in confined systems (ii) change in the annealing induced intermixing leading to the formation of SiGe alloy and (iii) roughness at the surface/interface. © 2016 Author(s).},

abstract={We analyze the peristaltic motion of aqueous electrolytes altered by means of applied electric fields. Handling electrolytes in typical peristaltic channel material such as polyvinyl chloride and Teflon leads to the generation of a net surface charge on the channel walls, which attracts counter-ions and repels co-ions from the aqueous solution, thus leading to the formation of an electrical double layer-a region of net charges near the wall. We analyze the spatial distribution of pressure and wall shear stress for a continuous wave train and single pulse peristaltic wave in the presence of an electrical (electroosmotic) body force, which acts on the net charges in the electrical double layer. We then analyze the effect of the electroosmotic body force on the particle reflux as elucidated through the net displacement of neutrally buoyant particles in the flow as the peristaltic waves progress. The impact of combined electroosmosis and peristalsis on trapping of a fluid volume (e.g., bolus) inside the travelling wave is also discussed. The present analysis goes beyond the traditional analysis, which neglects the possibility of coupling the net pumping of fluids due to peristalsis and allows us to derive general expressions for the pressure drop and flow rate in order to set up a general framework for incorporating flow control and actuation by simultaneous peristalsis and application of electric fields to aqueous solutions. It is envisaged that the results presented here may act as a model for the design of lab-on-a-chip devices. © 2016 Author(s).},

abstract={The present trend of increasing the penetration levels of Distributed Generator (DG) in the distribution network has made the issue of Islanding crucial for the reliable operation of the network. The islanding, if not detected early may lead to the collapse of the system as it can drive the distribution system to the cascaded failure. In this paper, an extensive study of the effect of DG placement and sizing is performed by dividing the system into different zones to obtain a reduced effect of islanding. The siting and sizing of DG is carried out to improve the overall voltage profile or/and reduction in active power loss using two stage Genetic Algorithm (GA). In the first stage a basic knockout selection is considered and the best population is taken for next stage, where roulette selection for crossover and mutation is performed for optimal placement and sizing of DGs. The effect of the islanding, due to load variations is reduced by optimal siting and sizing of DG. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is tested on the IEEE 33 and 69 radial bus systems and the results obtained are promising. © The Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers.},

Different concrete mixes, prepared for three water-cement ratios and 5 jarosite replacement levels. One fourth of cement has been replaced by fly ash in all the concrete mixtures. When compared to the control mixes, encouraging results were obtained in the tests to determine the mechanical properties of the concrete containing jarosite. The other important aspect of concrete i.e. durability has been revealed as satisfactory. The leaching of jarosite in concrete mixtures has been observed within the permissible limits of United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). The addition of jarosite as a partial sand replacement in concrete (along with fly ash as mineral admixture) up to 25% could be a new alternative feasible solution to its disposal issue. Also, the concrete with 15% jarosite as a sand replacement could be best suited for road and building construction purpose. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={We present seasonal rock magnetic data for 48 surficial soil samples collected seasonally around a coal-fired thermal power plant on the southwest coast of India to demonstrate how fly ash from the power plant is transported both spatially and seasonally. Sampling was carried out during pre-monsoon (March), early-monsoon (June), monsoon (September) and post-monsoon (December) seasons. Low- and high-frequency magnetic susceptibility (χlf and χhf), frequency-dependent magnetic susceptibility (χfd), χfd %, isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM), “hard” IRM (HIRM), saturation IRM (SIRM) and inter-parametric ratios were determined for the samples. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used on limited number of samples. NOAA HYSPLIT MODEL backward trajectory analysis and principal component analysis were carried out on the data. Fly ash samples exhibit an average HIRM value (400.07 × 10−5 Am2 kg−1) that is comparable to that of soil samples. The pre- and post-monsoon samples show a consistent reduction in the concentration of magnetically “hard” minerals with increasing distance from the power plant. These data suggest that fly ash has indeed been transported from the power plant to the sampling locations. Hence, HIRM may perhaps be used as a proxy for tracking fly ash from coal-fired thermal power plants. Seasonal data show that the distribution of fly ash to the surrounding areas is minimum during monsoons. They also point to the dominance of SP magnetite in early-monsoon season, whereas magnetic depletion is documented in the monsoon season. This seasonal difference is attributable to both pedogenesis and anthropogenic activity i.e. operation of the thermal power plant. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract={Nanoalloy clusters formed between Au and Si are topics of great interest today from both scientific and technological point of view. Due to its remarkable catalytic, electronic, mechanical and magnetic properties Au-Si nanoalloy clusters have extensive applications in the field of microelectronics, catalysis, biomedicine, and jewelry industry. Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a new paradigm of quantum mechanics, which is very much popular to study the electronic properties of materials. Conceptual DFT based descriptors have been invoked to correlate the experimental properties of nanoalloy clusters. In this venture, we have systematically investigated AuSin (n=1-9) nanoalloy clusters in the theoretical frame of the B3LYP exchange correlation. The experimental properties of AuSin (n=1-9) nanoalloy clusters are correlated in terms of DFT based descriptors viz. HOMO-LUMO gap, Electronegativity (χ), Global Hardness (η), Global Softness (S) and Electrophilicity Index (ω). The calculated HOMO-LUMO gap exhibits interesting odd-even alteration behaviour, indicating that even numbered clusters possess higher stability as compare to their neighbour odd numbered clusters. This study also reflects a very well agreement between experimental bond length and computed data. © 2016 Author(s).},

abstract={We analyze the electrokinetic transport of aqueous electrolyte fluids with Newtonian model in presence of peristalsis through microchannel. Debye-Hückel linearization is employed to simplify the problem. Low Reynolds number and large wavelength approximations are taken into account subjected to microfluidics applications. Electrical double layer (EDL) is considered very thin and electroosmotic slip velocity (i.e. Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity) at the wall is subjected to study the effect of applied electrical field. The solutions for axial velocity and pressure difference along the channel length are obtained analytically and the effects of adding and opposing the flow by applied electric field have been discussed. It is revealed that the axial velocity and pressure gradient enhances with adding electric field and an opposite behavior is found in the flow direction on opposing the electric field. These results may also help towards designing organ-on-a-chip like devices for better drug design. © 2016 Author(s).},

abstract={The nanotechnology and biomedical sciences opens the possibility for a wide variety of biological research topics and medical uses at the molecular and cellular level. The biosynthesis of nanoparticles has been proposed as a cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative to chemical and physical methods. Plant-mediated synthesis of nanoparticles is a green chemistry approach that connects nanotechnology with plants. Novel methods of ideally synthesizing NPs are thus thought that are formed at ambient temperatures, neutral pH, low costs and environmentally friendly fashion. Keeping these goals in view nanomaterials have been synthesized using various routes. Among the biological alternatives, plants and plant extracts seem to be the best option. Plants are nature's "chemical factories". They are cost efficient and require low maintenance. The advantages and disadvantages of nanotechnology can be easily enumerated. This study attempts to review the diversity of the field, starting with the history of nanotechnology, the properties of the nanoparticle, various strategies of synthesis, the many advantages and disadvantages of different methods and its application. © 2016 Author(s).},

abstract={Recent studies on the potential toxicity of High Aspect Ratio Nanoparticles (HARN) has yet once again reinforced the health hazard imposed by asbestos fibres ranging from nano to micro size. Asbestos a naturally occurring fibrous mineral declared a Group I definite carcinogen by IARC (International Agency for Research on Cancer), a unit of WHO in the year 1987, has been extensively used since World War II to the near past for various commercial products. According to the most recent World Health Organization (WHO) estimates, asbestos-related diseases, resulting from exposure at workplace claims more than 107000 lives every year worldwide. The various types of toxic effects induced by asbestos in humans include - i) inflammation and fibrogenesis of lung, ii) mesothelioma iii) asbestosis and iv) bronchogenic carcinoma. The stability of asbestos in natural environment and its biological aggressiveness is related to their fibrous structure and dimensions. The actual risk associated with the exposure to nanosized asbestos, which is still unknown and escapes most regulations worldwide, has been shown in various toxicity assessment studies conducted on various animal models.In an effort to reduce the size of asbestos and therby its toxicity by limiting its biopersistence, oxalic acid treatment of asbestos coupled to power ultrasound treatment was carried out. The nanosized particles formed were still found to retain their hazardous effect. Similar were the results obtained on strong acid treatment of asbestos as well. A probable solution to the asbestos toxicity problem therefore envisaged was bioremediation. This involved the secretion of iron chelating molecules termed siderophores by microbes, which are of significance due to their ability to form very stable and soluble complexes with iron. Iron in asbestos composition is a major factor responsible for its carcinogenicity, removal or extraction of which would prove to be an effective answer to the worldwide problem. Siderophores are low molecular weight organic compounds with a very high and specific affinity to chelate iron and enhance their diffusion to the microbial cell surface. A number of successful experiments carried out in vitro have shown positive results concerning reduction in asbestos toxicity on chelation of iron by siderophores. The present investigation tends to put forth the aspect of these biomolecules secreted by specific bacteria and fungi as potent tools to fight the micro to nano sized asbestos fibre toxicity. © 2016 Author(s).},

abstract={Carbon nanotube is having poor wet-ability with copper metal. Wet-ability of carbon nanotube was improved by exposing and creating more active sites on the surface of carbon nanotube. Carbon nanotubes were subjected to the prolong ultrasonication treatment of 20×103 Hz and 500W, which helped in disentanglement of carbon nanotube agglomerates and in breaking the weak bonds like pentagonal or heptagonal structure on the surface and on the CNT cap. Disentanglement of the carbon nanotube, resulted in exposing the defective sites on the surface and breaking of weak bonds, which assisted in creating the new defects on the surface. This process results in generates more active sites on the surface and it helps in improving the wet-ability of the carbon nanotube in copper. © 2016 Author(s).},

abstract={Discovery of porous silicon formation in silicon substrate in 1956 while electro-polishing crystalline Si in hydrofluoric acid (HF), has triggered large scale investigations of porous silicon formation and their changes in physical and chemical properties with thermal and chemical treatment. A nitrogen sorption study is used to investigate the effect of thermal annealing on electrochemically etched mesoporous silicon (PS). The PS was thermally annealed from 200°C to 800°C for 1 hr in the presence of air. It was shown that the pore diameter and porosity of PS vary with annealing temperature. The experimentally obtained adsorption / desorption isotherms show hysteresis typical for capillary condensation in porous materials. A simulation study based on Saam and Cole model was performed and compared with experimentally observed sorption isotherms to study the physics behind of hysteresis formation. We discuss the shape of the hysteresis loops in the framework of the morphology of the layers. The different behavior of adsorption and desorption of nitrogen in PS with pore diameter was discussed in terms of concave menisci formation inside the pore space, which was shown to related with the induced pressure in varying the pore diameter from 7.2 nm to 3.4 nm. © 2016 Author(s).},

Memristor has many advantages over conventional CMOS devices such as low leakage current at nanometer scale, easy to manufacture. In this work the switching characteristics of memristor is utilized. First the theoretical equations describing the switching behavior of memristor are investigated. To prove the switching capability of Memristor, a startup circuit based on memristor is proposed which uses series combination of Memristor and capacitor. Proposed circuit is compared with the previously reported MOSFET based startup circuits. Comparison of different circuits was done to validate the results. Simulation results show that memristor based circuit can attain on (I = 12.94 μA) to off state (I = 1.2 μA) in 25 ns while the MOSFET based startup circuits take on (I = 14.19 μA) to off state (I = 1.4 μA) in more than 90 ns. The benefit comes in terms of area because the number of components used in the circuit are lesser than the conventional startup circuits. © 2016 Author(s).},

abstract={ZnO nanoparticles synthesis was carried out by Sol–Gel wet chemical precipitation route. The crystallinity and the structure of ZnO was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern. The pattern gets indexed in wurtzite (hexagonal) structure with lattice constants a = b = 3_2606 Å and c = 5.2214 Å and confirms the single phase material with no impurity. The particle size in the sample is estimated using Debye Scherer’s (DS) formula lie in the range from 40 nm to 55 nm for three major planes, indicating the nano-crystalline nature of the sample. X-ray peak broadening analysis was used to evaluate the crystallite sizes and lattice strain by the Williamson–Hall analysis. The morphological analysis of the sample was carried out by Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The observed size of ZnO nanoparticles by TEM micrograph exhibits the similar trend with the size calculated by Debye-Scherer formula. TEM image shows the irregular shape of the nanoparticles and particle size lies in the range of 20–60 nm. Similar to SEM image, the agglomeration of the nanoparticles have been observed from TEM. The magnetization measurement of ZnO was carried out by SQUID Magnetometer.

This paper proposes a method to find the real-time transient stability state and identification of the coherent generator groups by predicting the rotor angle values following a large disturbance through radial basis function neural network.

abstract={The islanding issue in the distribution system poses great threat to the system during operation. With increased penetration levels of DG, the system is more vulnerable to islanding, leading to the collapse of the system. This paper proposes an improved method to detect the islanding in the system with DG penetration. The proposed work is a two-step method, firstly the siting and sizing of DG is obtained by two stage Genetic Algorithm (GA) to improve the voltage profile and to reduce the active power losses. A two stage GA ensures a faster convergence and better quality of solutions. Finally the proposed improved hybrid method is applied to detect the bus most susceptible for islanding under varying operating conditions. The improved hybrid islanding detection method utilizes the positive features of existing active and passive methods simultaneously. The proposed work is tested on IEEE 33 and 69 bus radial systems and the results obtained are promising. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={The integration of Distributed Generation (DG) into distribution networks is associated with large practical problems. With the large variation in load demand and the high penetration level of these distributed energy resources, the voltage stability issue has become a prime concern for the system operator. This paper proposes an optimal voltage control method for regulating the voltage of LV distribution network with DGs whenever the voltage at any bus exceeds normal operating limits. The algorithm is based on the voltage sensitivities to active and reactive power. The voltage regulation is achieved by power output management of DGs with re-dispatching their power outputs using Nonlinear Programming (NLP) optimization technique. The algorithm is tested on standard IEEE-33 bus radial distribution system and the result obtained shows the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Virtual ground voltage (Vgnd) has been used for fine grained optimization of power gated digital circuits. In this paper, we analyze the potential sources of error in dynamic characteristics of Vgnd due to inaccurate models as well as under-estimation of input voltages of CMOS gates in logic circuits. We propose a piecewise simulation based model for dynamic Vgnd estimation, which further needs capacitance models to be characterized at V gnd node. These capacitance models are used in conjunction with leakage current models to develop dynamic Vgnd model. Average error of less than 0.5% compared to 4.2% of previously reported models is achieved when compared to HSPICE results on ISCAS'85 benchmark circuits. On an average, our proposed model is 30 × efficient than HSPICE for dynamic V gnd estimation during mode transition. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={In order to implement Sequential Bayesian estimator using Monte carlo simulation and to get rid of limitations of Kalman filter, Particle filtering techniques plays a very crucial role for target tracking applications in state space where Importance sampling approximately distributed by posterior distribution with multimodel feature and robustness to noise. However as the particles becomes very large, the Monte carlo representation becomes nearly equivalent to analytical description characterization for posterior distributions and has some deficiencies such as high computational cost and low sampling efficiency. Therefore, emerging computing platform, cuda may be regarded as most appealing platform for such implementaion. Representation provided with set of samples for target distribution of state leads to increase in sampling efficiency so that graphics processing unit (GPUPU) becomes more appealing to use in Particle filter. The modification on mapping architecture are evaluated with qualitative analysis. The proposed design will be 3.5 times faster than direct design. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents a simple and an efficient approach for load flow analysis of a radial distribution network by using parallel computation. By introducing CUDA (Computationally Unified Device Architecture), a platform is provided for performing the parallel implementation of the analysis.The analysis starts by determining the order of the nodes present in the distribution network. To generate the order of the nodes, Breadth First Search is used in parallel. Further, the current and the voltages present at each node of the network are evaluated. This procedure is repeated till the convergence criterion is achieved. CUDA provides an efficient utilization of the computational power of GPU, by which the performance and throughput of sequential load flow algorithm, has been enhanced dramatically. With the immense support of many GPUs, CUDA helps load flow analysis to efficiently manage and manipulate a large blocks of data of the distribution networks. Moreover there has been a lot of reduction in the execution steps as compared to the serial computing. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={The present study describes surface modification of leather using environment friendly atmospheric pressure dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) process to improve dyeing with natural dyes. Leather samples were exposed to dielectric barrier discharge produced in air. DBD plasma treatment changes morphology and chemical composition of the surface of leather samples. The chemical changes at leather surface are confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. The morphology and chemical composition of leather surface is studied using scanning electron microscope and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. We observed significant improvement in dye uptake properties after air plasma treatment. Different species formed in plasma are identified using optical emission spectroscopy. Untreated and plasma treated samples were dyed with Eco-Garnet Brown, Eco-Hill Brown III, Eco-Turkey Red and Eco-Smoke Grey natural dyes. Dyeing behavior was assessed by spectroscopic measurement and by measuring fastness (wash and rub) properties. This has clearly indicated an increase in color intensity of plasma exposed leather as well as an increase in the dye uptake as compared to the untreated leather. Best results were obtained with Eco-Hill Brown III and Eco-Smoke Grey dyes. The study reveals that atmospheric pressure plasma has potential to become dry and eco-friendly process to modify leather surface to improve dye uptake properties with natural dyes. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

The coplanar waveguide fed circular patch antenna is modified by introducing L shaped slits in ground plane and U shaped slot in patch and performance analysis of antenna is simulated by applying CST microwave studio simulation software. Different designed antennas were tested with available experimental facilities.

From the research work done so far it is well understood that the high current crest factor is detrimental for the life of lamp electrodes. The work done in this paper provides information about the filament current crest factor with corresponding change in electrode temperature. The lamps used for these experiment are switched on and off with sufficient time given to cool the lamp electrodes. The degradation of the lamp life with respect to filament current crest factor and electrode temperature are plotted and analysed. The best fit is obtained for the set of experiments conducted. From the set of results obtained a mathematical equation is derived.

abstract={The science of Geomicrobiology. , which deals with mineral- microbe interaction in nature contributes effectively to three important processes namely- mineral and metal bioremediation, biomining and soil mineral formation by microbes. Bioremediation one of the important process of the above, degrades or transforms hazardous contaminants to less toxic compounds. Several groups of fungi have proved highly efficient in this aspect, with asbestos being one such toxic entity in the environment on which their activity was studied. The present investigation uses the same tool as a device for detoxifying asbestos, a potent carcinogenic entity; with fungal isolates native to the asbestos mines of Rajasthan, India, being investigated for the first time. The cellular mechanism of asbestos toxicity is mainly attributed to the presence of iron in its chemical composition which catalyzes generation of free radicals leading to oxidation of biomolecules. The two dominant novel species found therein, identified as Aspergillus tubingenesis and Coemansia reversa have proved capable of actively removing iron from asbestos fibers as studied by scanning electron microscopy- electron diffraction X-ray (SEM-EDX) analysis. This probably could lead to a reduction in toxicity of asbestos, due to reduced iron concentration as reported in related studies. Many fungi are known to release iron chelating compounds, siderophores, which could be instrumental in the study. The findings related to two new fungal species being added to the list of earlier identified fungal bioremediators of asbestos, widens the prospect of using bioremediation as an effective tool for asbestos detoxification. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Influence of ionization is studied on two stream instability (TSI) in an inhomogeneous plasma in the presence of obliquely applied magnetic field. In addition to the usual TSI, a new type of instability is found to occur in this system, which is driven by the magnetic field and survives for relatively longer wavelength of oscillations. The growth rates of both the instabilities are enhanced by the magnetic field but their magnitudes attain a minimum value at certain angles of the wave propagation depending upon the wavelength of oscillations. At a critical value of ionization rate there is a sudden fall in the growth of both the instabilities, the reason of which is understood as the Landau damping. A further enhancement in the ionization suppresses the usual TSI whereas the magnetic field-driven instability attains much lower growth. This new type of instability grows faster in the plasma having heavier ions, but shows a weak dependence on the charge of the ions. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.},

abstract={Aadhar, as the name rightly suggests might be considered the base of an individual's identity in India. Going into the technicalities, Aadhar number can be rightly called a 12 digit Unique Identification Number. It serves as a proof of identity for the citizens of India. Aadhar has not only helped in better identification of Indians but it has also lead them to reap enormous benefits of various government grants as well as subsidies, including the LPG subsidies as well as the scholarships intended for the meritorious students. This number carries various positive implications with itself. At the same time it also suffers from certain shortcomings of the likes of security concerns. This paper aims to assess and analyse the financial aspect of Aadhar/UID. The area under purview here is that of seeding the Aadhar with bank accounts of individuals in India. An assessment has been undertaken of the extent to which individuals feel to be benefitted out of this linkage. The results depict that the people consider this linkage as an effective tool for better identification of an individual.

abstract={Background: The fast emerging Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and its growing demand in each and every sphere of our lives has shifted our focus on the performance of the networks involved in varied fields. Recent studies depict that the performance of network and its utilization can be enhanced by QoS (Quality of Service) routing protocol. Thus, QoS is the essence of the WSNs. So, in this paper, we would like to present a detailed survey of the various routing protocols which play a vital role in attaining the QoS in WSNs. Methods: There are various levels of QoS which are required by the WSNs depending on the applications that they focus upon. The QoS support to WSNs can be achieved by various routing protocols. Thus, a detailed research on various routing protocols is done depicting their strengths and weakness and a comparison table of various protocols on various parameters is provided. Results: The QoS basically aims to focus on the quality that is perceived by the users of various applications. The QoS facilitates the above aim in terms of delay, packet delivery ratio, reduction in power of the sensor nodes, energy efficiency, bandwidth utilization, amount of through put generated and many other factors. However, there are few challenges faced by QoS which may occur due to dynamic topology and constrained resources. Even after these challenges the research suggests QoS is undisputedly the essence of WSNs. Conclusion: The QoS is very advantageous as it helps in improving the service provided to the users, and is accountable in improving the quality of output perceived by the users of various applications. Researchers have started working to overcome the challenges of QoS with the aim to minimize its constraints and maximize its multiple objectives. © 2016 Bentham Science Publishers.},

Threshold mechanism is effective to manage the load among VMs. Previous research shows thrashing is a good option to manage load and migrate the load among VMs during failover and high load.

We aim to split the identity image into well separated partitions in order to simplify the identification task. Our system will use the gray-scale information of the fingerprints. The system will select the primary fingerprint, perform feature extraction & feature matching to identify the image in the database by comparing the featured values of both the fingerprints.

abstract={Achieving expected level of Quality-of-experience (QoE) at receiving end during real-time video streaming is a challenging task in inherently error-prone multihop mobile ad hoc network (MANET). Continuously fluctuating link conditions, dynamicity in bit rates of transmitted video and topology change due to node mobility are some major issues in providing required QoE to multimedia traffic in MANETs. In this paper, we propose a reactive Link Stability Based Routing (LSBR) protocol. LSBR discover route consisting of links having high lifetime. The stability of a link is estimated dynamically during the route dis covery process using its signal strength and interference along with the relative mobility of nodes forming the link. A multi-metric mathematical model has been developed using the aforementioned parameters to select a link from the candidate links at each intermediate node in such a way that leads to selection of high lifetime route. To prove effectiveness of LSBR protocol for real-life video streaming, a hybrid MANET scenario consisted of simulated nodes and physical machines is designed using an industry standard emulation tool called EXata-Cyber. Correctness of LSBR protocol for video streaming is established by simulation, hybrid testbed as well as users’ experience. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

It has remarkable catalytic, electronic, optical and magnetic properties. A number of experimental as well as theoretical researchers are actively involved into this research domain. Theoretical approach is very popular in terms of Density Functional Theory (DFT) to compute the electronic structure of matter. Conceptual DFT based descriptors have been invoked to correlate the experimental properties of nano compounds and composites. In this report, we have studied AunSi (n=1-8) nano alloy clusters. Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) with basis set LanL2DZ have been used in this analysis. The experimental properties of the AunSi (n=1-8) nanoalloy clusters are correlated in terms of DFT based descriptors viz. HOMO-LUMO gap (eV), Electronegativity (χ), Global Hardness (η), Global Softness (S) and Electrophilicity Index (ω). The calculated HOMO-LUMO gap exhibits interesting odd-even oscillation behaviour, indicating that even numbered clusters possess higher stability in comparison with odd numbered clusters. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

It's almost fifteen years into the 21st Century, many universities around the world are trying new ways of teaching and learning and coping to find the new evaluation patterns in the classroom teaching. In the 21st century technology plays a significant role in changing the classroom environment. Many New Media Technologies were introduced by teachers to make the classroom more interactive and collaborative. This change has also been there for years in many universities around the world. Many universities in India are also a part of this pedagogy shift. Many universities are adapting new methods, processes and products to identify educational goals. The use of New Media Technologies, classrooms is becoming knowledge delivery centers and classrooms are expanding by themselves. Students can learn, interact and share the knowledge anywhere in the world. These technologies allow teachers to keep track on the student progress on time from anywhere. The technologies encourage peer to peer learning and collaborative research and also increase the teacher - student relationship. Teaching and learning through new media technologies helps to diversify the learner's need and provide a teacher student collaborative learning environment. This research paper deals with the awareness of the different New Media Technologies used in the classroom teaching among students in Jaipur Region India. The main purpose of this research for the conduction of the experimental research among students in near future and to identify the effect of new media technologies on students' performance.},

abstract={Anomaly exposure is a grave concern in network intrusion classification (IDS). Furthermost anomaly based IDSs employ supervised procedures, whose enactments extremely be contingent on attack-free training statistics. Nonetheless, this generous of training data is problematic to acquire in real-world network environment. Additionally, with fluctuating network setting or services, patterns of typical traffic will be reformed. This leads to high false-positive rate of supervised IDSs. Real-time detection is one of the most imperative issues in intrusion detection. When the network data is becoming enormous with high dimensionality, real-time detection with high detection accuracy and low false alarm rate is challenging for previous methods. The vertical progression in data volume and Hadoop cluster extent make it a momentous encounter to diagnose and localize problems in a production-level cluster setting competently and within a petite epoch of time. Frequently, the disseminated monitoring schemes are not accomplished of perceiving a problem thriving in earlier when a comprehensive Hadoop cluster twitches to depreciate in enactment or becomes unattainable. This research exertion proposed an unsupervised outlier detection based on fuzzy-based model also with typically K-means clustering algorithm and categorize different types of anomaly which can overwhelmed the downsides of supervised incongruity detection. The tryouts were accomplished on KDD’99 intrusion detection dataset to associate the performance and enactment of the proposed procedure with a typical K-means clustering algorithm and perceived reduced computational time and enriched classification accuracy. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2016.},

abstract={Objectives of the Study: The purpose of this paper is to examine the role of financial literacy in the realization of financial inclusion in India. If we analyze the financial inclusion, we will found that achieving the financial inclusion is based on two pillars - demand side and supply side. Where availability of the financial products in the market is very important, equally important is the fact that people are aware of them and they are in a situation to demand those products. In this context, financial literacy among the masses is very important, so that people have the awareness about the financial climate and financial products. This will increase their capability to demand for the financial products. This way, it can achieve the target of financial inclusion. Research Methodology: The research work is based on the secondary data. These data are obtained fromRBI publications, research papers and text books. It also uses secondary data from various other sources- newspapers, journals and periodicals like Economic Times, Business Line, Micro-Finance world etc. The study is designed as follows: In section-1 we introduce the concept of financial inclusion. An attempt is made to understand meaning, role and importance of financial inclusion. Section-2 will describe the link between financial inclusion and financial literacy and the various facets of it. In section-3 we provide our conclusions and some suggestions. Findings: Financial inclusion is an attempt to achieve the ultimate objective i.e. inclusive growth. Financial inclusion is an important constituent of this, because a financially deprivement is a very big deterrent of a person's overall development. Our study reveals that the final answer of financial inclusion rests on both sides-demand side and supply side. It is now, becoming increasingly apparent that addressing the problem of financial exclusion will require a holistic approach in creating awareness about not only on credit management but on financial products, education, debt counseling, savings and advice on money management. Significance of the Work: The research work addresses important aspects like financial awareness, education, debt counseling, etcwhich can contribute to attain our goal of financial inclusion.},

abstract={In the era of Liberalization, the banking sector has grown extremely but still money lenders in rural areas are continuously taking advantage of the poor section. Over the years there have been many schemes that had been taken up by the RBI and the government to take forward the financial inclusion process in India. Financial inclusion is a new concept which enables the alternative techniques to promote the banking habits and acts as enabler in reducing the poverty. The main objective of financial inclusion is to connect all individualwith banking system. This connection will lead to uplift their standard of living and overall development of the economy. The current government in the last year came up with extremelymotivated project, the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) in August 2015. The prime objective of the PMJDY is to ensure financial inclusion of the poor and rural population by giving them selfesteem, financial liberty and financial constancy. This scheme is a national mission on financial inclusion. It has the objective of covering all households in the country having a bank account and other banking facilities.This paper focusesthe evaluation of this scheme with reference to rural people of Bagru village of Jaipur City in Rajasthan. It also aims to highlight the present scenario of PMJDY in 2016 with the help of some true stories.},

We aim to split the identity image into well separated partitions in order to simplify the identification task. Our system will use the gray-scale information of the fingerprints. The system will select the primary fingerprint, perform feature extraction & feature matching to identify the image in the database by comparing the featured values of both the fingerprints. Our implementation mainly incorporates image pre-processing, image partitioning, image binarization, feature extraction and feature matching. It finally generates a score which tells whether two fingerprints match or not. © 2016 The Authors.},

abstract={This paper has been proposed to present a simple approach for load flow analysis of a radial distribution network using parallel programming in Computationally Unified Device Architecture (CUDA). The proposed approach applies Breadth First Search to evaluate the nodes in the network and Kirchhoff’s current law (KCL) as well as Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL) for evaluating the current and voltages at each of the network nodes. The procedure is repeated till the convergence criterion is achieved. The paper demonstrates the working of Breadth First Search using CUDA. The efficiency of load flow algorithm has been enhanced by utilizing parallel computational power of Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). This approach has been tested for 33-nodes as well as for 69-nodes radial distribution systems and comparison has been done between the performances of sequential approach over CPU and parallel approach on GPU. The results show that introducing CUDA to load flow analysis speeds up the performance of the system by faster executions and gives accurate desired results as compared to sequential approach. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2016.},

abstract={The present study investigates the radiation effects in flow through porous medium over a permeable rotating disk with velocity slip and temperature jump. Fluid properties density (ρ), viscosity (μ), and thermal conductivity () are taken to be dependent on temperature. Particular case considering these fluid properties' constant is also discussed. The governing partial differential equations are converted into nonlinear normal differential equation using similarity alterations. Transformed system of equations is solved numerically by using Runge-Kutta method with shooting technique. Effects of various parameters such as porosity parameter K, suction parameter Ws, rotational Reynolds number Re, Knudsen number Kn, Prandtl number Pr, radiation parameter N, and relative temperature difference parameter ϵ on velocity profiles along radial, tangential, and axial direction and temperature distribution are investigated for both variable fluid properties and constant fluid properties. Results obtained are analyzed and depicted through graphs and table. © 2016 Shalini Jain and Shweta Bohra.},

abstract={The population of India has rapidly increased from 68.33 million to 121.01 million from 1981 to 2011, respectively. It is estimated that by the year 2028 India will hold the largest population of the world. The prompt upsurge of the Indian population will force people to migrate from the rural area to the mega cities, to avail basic amenities. The enormous migration will increase the demand for more space to live in mega cities and will lead to a situation of unauthorized, unplanned, uncoordinated, and uncontrolled growth, and this condition called as urban sprawl. The key challenge for a planner is to achieve sustainable development and to predict the future urban sprawl in the city. Unfortunately, conventional techniques that predict urban sprawl are expensive and time consuming. In this paper, we have proposed a novel technique to predict the future urban sprawl. We have used an integrated approach of Remote Sensing, GIS, and Multilayer perceptron to predict the future urban sprawl for the city Jaipur up to 2021. We have compared our results with existing techniques like Linear Regression and Gaussian Process and found that the Multilayer perceptron gives better results than other existing techniques. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

abstract={Due to the advancement in communication technologies, mobile ad hoc networks are very attractive in terms of communication because mobile nodes can communicate without the relay on predefined infrastructure. There-fore, some complex properties of mobile ad hoc networks make it more vulnerable to internal and external attacks. From the security perspective, prevention based methods such as encryption and authentication are not consider-ably good solution for mobile ad hocnetworks to eliminate the attacks so that intrusion detection systems are applied as a keystone in these types of networks. The main objec-tive of intrusion detection system is to categories the nor-mal and suspicious activities in the network. This paper proposed a novel intrusion detection system based on soft computing techniques for mobile ad hoc networks. The proposed system is based on neuro-fuzzy classifier in bi- nary form to detect, one of vey possible attack, i.e. packet dropping attack in mobile ad hoc networks. Qualnet Sim- ulator 6.1 and MatLab toolbox are used to visualize the proposed scenarios and evaluate the performance of pro-posed approach in mobile ad hoc networks.

abstract={Purpose: The research paper aims at studying the various factors affecting consumer's online purchase attitude and the relative importance of these factors in determining consumer's online purchase attitude. Additionally the study focusses on examining the effect of consumer's online purchase attitude on their purchase intention. Design/Methodology/Approach: An empirical study was conducted where 100 individuals responded towards the questionnaire. The study examines that how an individual's perception differs from each other on the different factors affecting their purchase attitude which will determine their online purchase intention. Findings:The proposed framework explains the 64% of the total variance in purchase attitude affected by some identified factors in online shopping. Out of these major identified factors six factors were proven to have a significant effect on the purchase attitude i.e. risk of identity theft, risk of losing privacy, trustworthiness of the vendor, past purchase experience and time taken to deliver the products whereas the remaining three factors were proven to have no significant effect on the purchase attitude i.e. product return policy, time taken to access web page and information on FAQ's and complaint resolution.Additionally As a result the literature support the positive relationship betweenattitude and online purchase intention. Research Limitations/Implications:The study was limited to the population of two cities of Rajasthan i.e. Ajmer and Jaipur taking small sample into consideration. Additionally the study could cover only 64% of variability in the online purchase intention due to the discussed factors. Practical Implications:The study contributes towards the development of the various ecommerce models and helps the various e-commerce companies as well as the online vendors to understand the different factors affecting online purchase intention due to differences in attitude which will increase their revenue and improve upon their strategies. Social implications: The study will benefit the society by providing the various critical factors affecting an individual's online purchase intention to be considered while shopping online and would create more awareness among them about purchasing over the internet. Originality/value:The study covers the population of Ajmer and Jaipur city of Rajasthan where no such studies have been done ever before.},

abstract={Background: Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) consist of sensor nodes which are able to sense a variety of physical phenomenon. It is a well-known fact that in most of the real world applications related to WSNs, the deployment is random as manual deployment is not possible due to harsh environments and other complexities. Therefore, there is no prior knowledge about the position of the sensor nodes that are deployed to form a wireless sensor network. In order to overcome this aspect related to position estimate of sensor nodes various localization schemes and algorithms have been proposed. The schemes and algorithms proposed so far also offer advantages like optimal routing, energy conservation, security, topology control besides providing the accurate position estimation of deployed sensor nodes. This paper explicitly presents a survey on the existing learning and non-learning based algorithms that have special role in localization of sensor nodes for WSNs. Methods: Comparative analysis of prominent learning and non-learning based algorithms. The analysis is based in terms of physical measurement, accuracy, computation and hardware cost and energy efficiency. Result: Detailed reporting of learning and non-learning based algorithms with their sub-categories. The study and survey of various algorithms throw light on their applicability and use for WSNs. Conclusion: Characteristics exhibited by the variants of the discussed algorithms are featured in order to make them application centric and cost effective. © 2016 Bentham Science Publishers.},

The usage of cryptography characteristics of cellular automata are still not much explored in WSN. Hence in this paper, we present a symmetric key cryptography technique of block cipher using cellular automata (CAs) rules applied to sensor data in WSN. This cryptography technique uses non- complemented cellular automata rules and hybrid CA rule vector to form a group cellular automata that would be used to encrypt and decrypt sensor data.

Detection of ALL is usually done by skilled pathologists, automatic detection of leukemia will reduce the diagnosis time and will also be independent of the skills of the pathologist. In this paper, we propose using texture descriptors extracted from the nucleus image for detection of ALL. The disease causes change in the chromatin distribution of the nucleus, which can be observed in the form of texture. We have used two texture features, namely Local Binary pattern and Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix for automatic detection of ALL. A comparative analysis of both the features is presented. It is seen that LBP features perform better than GLCM features. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2016.},

A unidirectional radiation pattern with stable gain has also been observed for the entire range of frequency operation. Symmetric radiation pattern for both E-plane and H-plane has also been confirmed owing to the symmetry of antenna structure and feed excitation.

The governing equations of fluid flow have been solved using regular perturbation technique. This is observed that the small values of the Peclet number increase the thermal conductivity of the fluid and therefore, the heat is able to diffuse away from the heated surface more rapidly. Moreover, an increase in the thermal radiation leads to props up the fluid temperature within the boundary layer. Further, the non-dimensional shearing stress and the rate of heat transfer in terms of the Nusselt number at the walls of channel are also obtained. © 2016 Institute of Thermomechanics CAS, v.v.i.},

abstract={The development of financial inclusive sector in India has been promising with mobile technology playing a prominent role. The rate of growth of rural teledensity is phenomenal. Mobile banking (M-Banking) has therefore proved to be a win-win situation for both banks and telecom companies. On a parallel track, it is seen that acceptance and adoption of mobile as a channel has been an issue in rural areas. There seems to be dearth of analysis of factors resulting in the slow rate of growth. This paper attempts to dig out barriers and enablers of M-Banking in rural India and weave them using an interpretive structural modelling (ISM). The model results in connecting the dots and help the policy makers of banks and telecom companies analyse the issues faced at various levels. The results will add to the body of literature and simultaneously help practitioners to understand the various levels of implementation. Copyright © 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={The impact of ambient temperature rise and, therefore T-point temperature rise too, on the life time of LEDs is analysed in this paper. From the research conducted so far it is understood that life time resource of LEDs is mainly dependent on junction temperature. For most of the high power LEDs, which are enclosed inside a luminaire, dissipation of junction heat from the device is a major concern for most of the manufacturers. In this paper, an attempt has been made to investigate the underlying constraints of heat dissipation and subsequently using LEDs as a general light source. The investigation is carried out in two steps. Firstly, the degradation in light output with corresponding increase in ambient temperature is explored. Secondly, the impact of increase in T-point temperature on the lifetime of the LEDs is observed. The experiment is conducted using high power LEDs and the same is subjected to external thermal stress. The temperature inside the environmental chamber represents the ambient temperature for the LED and thus by gradually increasing the ambient temperature the T-point temperature is also increased. The temperature of the chamber and the T-point are measured by using k-type thermocouple. The corresponding data hence obtained are tabulated and correlated with light output. The results are analysed using statistical tool to obtain the relation between the parameters. © 2016, LLC Editorial of Journal “Light Technik”. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Cellular Automata (CAs) is one of the most engrossing field for encrypting sensor data applied in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). In wireless communications, requirement of security and privacy of information is must. Therefore, transmission of sensor data over wireless communication channel plays a crucial role using cryptography techniques. The usage of cryptography characteristics of cellular automata are still not much explored in WSN. Hence in this paper, we present a symmetric key cryptography technique of block cipher using cellular automata (CAs) rules applied to sensor data in WSN. This cryptography technique uses non- complemented cellular automata rules and hybrid CA rule vector to form a group cellular automata that would be used to encrypt and decrypt sensor data. Proposed methodology has been implemented in C to validate the results. © 2016 The Authors.},

abstract={The screen adaptation of the novella Devdas by Saratchandra Chattopadhyay is an important landmark in early Indian cinema. A prominent film, screened in four Indian languages (Bengali, Hindi, Telugu and Tamil), it seems to offer a novel vision of romantic love and romanticism. This article critiques the fanciful interpretations of the film provided by some postmodern academics in the field of comparative literature. It endeavours to place the film both as text and cinematic work into a broader perspective based on the study of intertextuality of three renditions: Raghavaiah's Devdas (Telugu, 1953), Bimal Roy's Devdas (Hindi, 1955) and Bhansali's Devdas (Hindi, 2002). Grounded in cultural theory and Indian performative aesthetics coupled with moving image analysis, this study highlights the underlying, deep-rooted romanticism embedded in Indian philosophical and aesthetic traditions of devotion between atma (individual soul) and paramatma (absolute soul), personifying Paro/Chandramukhi as atma and Devdas as paramatma. This article, part of a larger project on de-Westernising media studies, makes a critical intervention in current South Asian Studies by aiming to provide a novel theoretical framework to which the philosophical and traditional tenets grounding the novella of Devdas can be anchored. © 2016, SAGE Publications.

abstract={The world is a competitive arena where survival is dependent on sustainability. Environment has gradually changed and had influenced the sustainable development in the recent past. The changing era of technology has played a vital role in enhancing sustainable development through environmental ecosystem. This paper explores a niche area of environmentally sound technology (EST) to understand the holistic view of sustainable development through the microscope of society in India. This paper aims at exploring the barriers in adoption of EST in rural India and modelling the barriers in a revised unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model. It also projects revision in the model by adding moderating effect of prior experience, gender and age of end users to understand the change in behavioural intention of the user in rural areas. The results reflect difference in behavioural intention and degree of usage for different age groups and gender. The results derived from primary data collection showcase a classified result of barriers clearly justifying the moderating effect by each of the external factors. The revised UTAUT model is one of the few models knit for EST in a rural dynamics like India. © 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={Difficult geographies and high mobile penetration were seen as extremely potential for shifting focus from e-governance to m-governance in India. M-governance program 'm-Sewa' was implemented in 2012. However, success of m-Sewa project depends on adoption and implementation by different State governments. A few Indian states have created comprehensive service delivery platform, integrated with their e-governance infrastructure. On the other hand, a few other states are just beginning the journey; while some other states are years behind. This paper attempts to make a comparative study of the m-government projects undertaken by different states of India as the mode to offer various government department services accessible to the citizens through mobile phones. The paper also attempts to evaluate the implementations as per elaboration likelihood model (ELM) framework. This paper will help the policy makers to decide the implementation strategy and kind of services to offer to maximise the adoption by users. Copyright © 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

For the Darcian model, the velocity and heat equations are analytically solved and the effects of various physical parameters on thses are discussed. In addition, the Entropy generation rate, Nusselt number and Bejan number are analyzed for different parameters. It was perceived that entropy generation number attains high values due to the thermal radiation. This is also concluded that rate of heat transfer upsurges due to the radiative heat tansfer and Brinkmann number.},

abstract={Image enhancement is a technique to improve the quality metrics of a distorted image. In forensic laboratory, if the input is noisy fingerprint image then image enhancement plays the crucial role to authenticate the verification stage. In this work, the author proposed to construct a filter based on Log-Gabor theory for enhancement of high noisy (Gaussian Noise) fingerprint image. To construct the filter, first initialize all filter parameters and to overcome the wrap around effect, first calculate the sine and cosine differences along with angular distance. When the filter is constructed, do the convolution with FFT of input noisy image. The resultant enhanced image attained PSNR and MAE (Mean Absolute Error) 7.9230, 101.728 dB, respectively. The comparison values of quality metrics for Mat lab inbuilt function (wiener and median filter) are 7.3291, 7.3281, and 101.977, 101.986 dB respectively for same test image. In this work, there is a little improvement in PSNR value which play significant role in verification stage. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2016.},

abstract={The main task for the software management is to predict the reliability of a software by using an appropriate software reliability growth model (SRGM). The accuracy of the mechanism adopted for reliability prediction is also an important factor. In this study, a software reliability growth modelling problem has been solved using artificial neural networks (ANNs), as ANNs based models are competitive with traditional statistical models for software testing effort estimation. In the first phase, a software reliability growth model has been proposed with compounded decreased error rate to predict the software reliability. The model is further extended by incorporating Cobb-Douglas production function to model the combined effect of time and resources used. Multi-layer feed-forward neural network is used to solve the problems. The weights associated with various input parameters are updated using generalised delta rule and Levenberg-Marquardt method. A comparison is then made with the results from existing models in the literature. The work is validated by using two famous real data sets. Numerical results show that the proposed models perform better in comparison to others existing in the literature. Copyright © 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={Gear system is one of the most important components in any mechanical power transmission system. A gear pair in action is generally subjected to contact loading at the mating surface. In this paper, the stresses due to contact loading have been evaluated on the surface of gear tooth and along the gear tooth depth. The spur gear was considered for this study for two different loading conditions, torques of 150 Nm and 200 Nm. The involute profile of the spur gear was generated using an ANSYS APDL program prior to spur gear model development. The finite element analysis was carried out using ANSYS 15. The Finite Element Method (FEM) was comparatively an easy and accurate technique for analysing the nonlinear gear contact stresses. Frictional coefficients ranging from 0.0 until 0.3 were selected and the corresponding contact stresses were found to be directly proportional to the friction coefficients. A governing equation for the relationship between the dimensionless contact stress values and gear tooth depth ratios for varying friction coefficients was established. The results showed that the maximum stress was located beneath the surface of the gear tooth in contact for low friction coefficient values, μ < 0.23. The stress trend remains the same for μ > 0.23 but the surface stress becomes greater than the stresses beneath the surface. Furthermore, the position of maximum stress along the depth of contact was unchanged regardless of the amount of torque applied and frictional coefficient values. ©2006-2016 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).},

abstract={The energy band alignment at the heterointerfaces plays a vital role in understanding the physics and optical processes such as optical gain or optical absorption in semiconductor opto-electronic devices. This paper reports the behavior of field effective energy band alignment followed by the behavior of probability density of the charge carriers in the respective bands of type-I Al0.45Ga0.55As/GaAs0.84P0.16 symmetric nano-scale-heterostructures. In addition, the optical gain of the structure within TE (transverse electric) and TM (transverse magnetic) modes under constant electric field applied is also simulated and analyzed. In order to simulate the optical gain of the structure, 4 × 4 diagonal k→.P→ Hamiltonian matrix is solved for the purpose of getting envelope functions associated with carriers, carrier densities, dispersion curves of the quantum well structure, transition matrix elements and finally the optical gain. On behalf of simulated results achieved, it is reported that the optical gain in TM mode is found much greater than that in TE mode which is opposite to usual trends. Moreover, the application of external electric field along the growth direction shows that the optical gain within TM mode and the wavelength both can be controlled by controlling the electric field applied. Thus, the nano-heterostructure can be tuned externally by the application of external electric field within the NIR (near infra red) region. © 2016 Elsevier GmbH},

abstract={Speech is the most popular communication medium used in real time. Speech is a one dimensional signal which is easily corrupted by the noise. De-noising is the only technique to remove the noise which is done in preprocessing techniques. Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is the efficient technique used for de-noising. Speech is recorded first and then preprocessed Spectrum is being calculated. The preprocessed speech is then jointly processed by MODGDF and MFCC technique for features extraction and later classified by Naive bias classifier technique for acquiring greater recognition accuracy. The proposed methods are implemented for 100 speakers uttering 10 words. The integrated performance of Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC), Modified group delay function (MODGDF) feature extraction technique and Naïve Bayes classification technique (NBC) is based on recognition accuracy. Parameters like (LSP) Line spectrum, (PPF) Pitch prediction filter, (CBI) Code base indexes, Gain, Synchronization, (FEC) Forward error correction are extracted. The explored results prove the ability of these techniques for recognizing the Telugu speech. © International Science Press.},

abstract={Due to its large scale applications in the real field, the study of bi-metallic nano-alloy clusters is an active field of research. Though a number of experimental reports are available in this domain, a deep theoretical insight is yet to receive. Among several nano-clusters, the compound formed between Cu-Ag has gained a large importance due to its remarkable optical property. Density Functional Theory (DFT) is one of the most popular approaches of quantum mechanics to study the electronic properties of materials. Conceptually, DFT based descriptors have turned to be indispensable tools for analyzing and correlating the experimental properties of compounds. In this venture, we have analyzed the experimental properties of the (Cu-Ag)n=1-7 nano-alloy clusters invoking DFT methodology. A nice correlation has been found between optical properties of the aforesaid nano-clusters with our evaluated theoretical descriptors. The similar agreement between experimental bond length and computed data is also reflected in this analysis. Beside these, the effect of even-odd alternation behavior of nano compounds on the HOMO-LUMO gap is very important in our computation. It is probably the first attempt to establish such type of correlation. © 2015 Prabhat Ranjan et al.},

abstract={In this paper, a novel design of a compact planar ultra wide band (UWB) monopole antenna with triple band notched characteristics has been presented. The antenna has a unique shape and has been fed through a 50 ω microstrip feedline. The strength of the antenna lies in three band notched properties for WiMax system at 3.3-3.7 GHz, WLAN IEEE 802.11a at 5.15-5.85 GHz and X band satellite communication at 7.25-8.395 GHz. The notched bands have been achieved by incorporating an inverted U-slot etched on the radiator patch, an inverted C-slot also on the radiator patch and a U-slot on the microstrip feed line. In order to achieve FCC defined impedance bandwidth of 7.5 GHz, a rectangular cut in the ground plane has been introduced along with staircase structure in the bottom edge of the radiator. The proposed antenna is having a compact size of 30 X 30 X 1.6 mm3 and exhibits a large bandwidth from 2.8 GHz to 10.7 GHz. The antenna has been successfully simulated and fabricated. The radiation pattern is omni-directional in H-plane and the E-plane exhibits dipole like radiation pattern. The gain of the antenna is stable across the whole operating frequency band except at three notched bands. © 2015 SBMO/SBMag.},

The gaseous and solid products were used to generate heat and electrical power, whereas the bio-oil was stored and supplied for other applications. The overall efficiency of the base case model was estimated for conversion of biomass into useable forms of bio-energy. It was found that the proposed design is not only significantly efficient but also potentially suitable for distributed operation of pyrolysis plants having centralised post processing facilities for production of other biofuels and chemicals. It was further determined that the bio-oil quality improved using a multi-stage condensation system. However, the recycling of flue gases coming from combustor instead of non-condensable gases in the pyrolyzer led to increase in the overall efficiency of the process with degradation of bio-oil quality. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

In order to analyze these aspects and to explore the comparative assessment, this work has utilized available statistical data of OECD. The study employed DPSIR methods outlined in the OECD report, which state that Indicators measure the decoupling of environmental pressure from economic growth for analyzing environmental pressure/degradation indicators, such as population growth, energy production, greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, CO2emission, SOx emission, NOx emission, water abstraction and waste with economic indicator, i.e., nominal and per capita GDP. The major finding of this study is that among the selected indicators, some resulted from relative decoupling rather than absolute decoupling, which means that the environmental pressure still increases, albeit at a lower rate than economic performance, and that the presence of decoupling is not an indication for sustainable economic development. © 2015 Taylor and Francis.},

abstract={The process of bioweathering involving natural microbes, natural plants and transgenic animals has proven to be a very efficient and effective tool for detoxifying xenobiotics. The present investigation uses the same tool as a device for detoxifying asbestos, a potent carcinogenic entity. The cellular mechanism of asbestos toxicity to a certain extent, as shown by research, is attributed to its chemical composition particularly the presence of iron in its structure. Many bacteria release iron chelating compounds, siderophores, which could be instrumental in the study. Treatment of asbestos was carried out under specific parameters with bacterial isolates native to the mines of Rajasthan from which asbestos was collected. An assessment was then done to evaluate reduction in iron content of the asbestos fibres by Scanning Electron Microscopy-Energy Dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX). A remarkable decrease was observed in the iron content of asbestos following treatment with most of the bacterial isolates used, which probably could form the basis for asbestos bioweathering studies. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={In this paper, a novel design of diaphragm based pressure sensor has been proposed, which may find its application in Intra Uterine Pressure Catheter (IUPC) system. The novelty of the device lies in the fact that it has got patterned slots over the top layer of the diaphragm similar to a chess-board pattern. This sensor is then compared with a plane diaphragm of same dimensions. In same range of input pressure, results show that the plane diaphragm has capacitive sensitivity of 0.06385 pF/kPa, while in the slotted diaphragm, it is 0.17355 pF/kPa, three times as that of the plane one. However, the static pull-in voltage comes out to be almost 16 volt due to constant air gap of 0.4 μm for both the cases. Due to pull-in voltage in the range of 11-20 volts, it can also be used as an electrostatic actuator in switching networks. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Performance and reliability of nanoscale memory and logic devices is determined by few electron-phenomena. In this context, the organic molecules may offer some advantages for future memory applications. Since, a molecule is the smallest component whose electrical properties can be engineered, it can be argued that the ultimate integrated circuit will be constructed at the molecular level. This fact has been the driving force behind molecular electronics research of recent times. This article investigates the aspects of modeling, synthesis and analysis of nanocell based molecular memory. In our work, we have developed the HSPICE as well as probabilistic models for nanocell based molecular memory. An attempt has been made to develop a CAD tool for synthesis of such molecular memories which are posing interesting and promising research challenges at futuristic cutting edge of technology spectrum. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Key message: Pithecellobium dulcehas a huge repository of morphological and genetic diversity within the species which has been documented for further tree research and breeding programmes. Abstract: A total of 40 accessions of a multipurpose leguminous tree, Pithecellobium dulce, differing in morphological and phenological characteristics was collected from different locations in Rajasthan and genetic diversity assessed using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers. Out of 60 RAPD primers, 43 decamer primers produced 311 scorable bands of which 223 bands were polymorphic. Polymorphic banding patterns with the number of amplified fragments varied from 1 (OPA-12 and OPF-17) to 12 (OPF-04, OPT-07, OPT-17, OPT-20). Percent polymorphism ranged from 33.3 % (OPF-07, OPA-20, OPT-05) to 89 % (OPA-13) with an average of 64.34 %. Out of the 20 ISSR primers screened, 8 primers produced 77 amplification products of which 55 were polymorphic. The number of bands amplified per primer varied between 6 (UBC-820) and 13 (UBC-808 and UBC-816) with average band size between 300 and 4,500 bp. Percent polymorphism ranged from 38 % (UBC-817) to 100 % (UBC-811) with an average of 71 %. Dendrogram constructed on the basis of combined RAPD and ISSR markers separated the accessions into five distinct clusters at 53 % variation with Jaccard’s similarity coefficient ranging from minimum similarity (0.35) between Karoli (K) and Malviya Nagar, Jaipur (MN1) to maximum similarity (0.81) between two populations of Kota (K1 and K2). The matrices for two markers, RAPD and ISSR, were also compared using Mantel’s test. The correlation value between the matrices is high (r = 0.83) indicating good correlation between the two molecular marker systems. The study indicated a high level of morphological and genetic diversity in P. dulce. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Spin-polarized Compton profiles of TbCo2 have been measured to elucidate the interesting behavior of spin and orbital moments at different temperatures. The magnetic Compton profiles (MCPs) have been analyzed in terms of site specific spin moments due to Tb-4f electrons, Co and itinerant electrons. The temperature dependence of the orbital moment has been deduced using Compton and magnetometry data ranging between 6 and 300 K. The present data exhibit a decrease in the ratio of orbital to spin moments from 43.9% to 35.0% (while going from 6 to 300 K). First-principles calculations within DFT + U scheme have also been performed to confirm the spin-, orbital- and site specific-magnetic moments in TbCo2. An antiparallel exchange coupling between the Tb-4f and Co spin moments is found. The orbital moment is found to have a parallel coupling with the Tb spin moment, as evident from the experimental MCPs. From first-principles data it is seen that the orbital moments of Tb and Co sites are antiparallel to each other, as in the case of their spin magnetic moments. The present experimental study also shows an existence of an itinerant moment which is coupled ferromagnetically with the Tb-4f spin moment. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The experimental Compton profile (CP) has been compared with the theoretical profiles computed using linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) within framework Hartree-Fock scheme and of density functional theory. Comparison of theoretical and experimental CPs demonstrates usefulness of revised functional of Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (so called PBEsol) in computing the electronic properties of RuO<inf>2</inf>. The energy bands and density of states of RuO<inf>2</inf> are also reported using LCAO and full potential linearized augmented plane wave (FP-LAPW) method within PBEsol approximation. The complex dielectric functions computed using FP-LAPW method are explained in terms of transitions within energy bands.

abstract={The present research protocol was developed to locate endophytic fungi present inside the healthy leaves of Tinospora cordifolia. The surface sterilized leaf explants after staining with lactophenol cotton blue showed the presence of endophytic fungi in intercellular spaces of ground, dermal tissue especially in midrib region. Leaves have shown dense colonies of endophytic fungi. Microscopic examination of in vitro and in vivo leaves has shown mycelium which was dense, branched and septate. Hence, the comparative study was conducted in both in vitro and in vivo leaves of T. cordifolia to locate endophytic fungi. The present study revealed that the fungi are not only developed in plants under natural environment but also under controlled conditions i.e. tissue culture of plants. Therefore, the present research work favoured the view that endophytes can infect nutrient medium of in vitro culture of T. cordifolia and diversity of endophytic fungi increase after hardening and acclimatization of T. cordifolia plantlets. The presence of endophytes in in vitro cultures depends both on age of tissue and host genotype. Further studies are required to isolate the endophytic fungi, pure culture on PDA plates and their identification to explore their biosynthetic pathway. © 2015 Elsevier GmbH.},

abstract={Localization is extensively used in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) to identify the current location of the sensor nodes. A WSN consist of thousands of nodes that make the installation of GPS on each sensor node expensive and moreover GPS will not provide exact localization results in an indoor environment. Manually configuring location reference on each sensor node is also not possible in the case of dense network This gives rise to a problem where the sensor nodes must identify its current location without using any special hardware like GPS and without the help of manual configuration. Localization techniques make the deployment of WSNs economical. Most of the localization techniques are carried out with the help of anchor node or beacon node, which knows its present location. Based on the location information provided by the anchor node or beacon node, other nodes localize themselves. In this paper we present a succinct survey on the localization techniques used in wireless sensor networks covering its problems and research gap. © 2014 IEEE.},

But the main challenge of Wireless Sensor Networks lies in achieving communications with low energy consumption. In order to overcome the problem of energy consumption, a well-known clustering algorithm, LEACH (Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy) was designed. However, LEACH has some disadvantages. In this paper, we propose a new clustering algorithm based on LEACH. It establishes a new Threshold which includes the node energy and distance between node and base station and distance between cluster head and base station for measuring the threshold value. Simulation results show that proposed algorithm is better than LEACH in balancing the node energy and thus enhancing the network lifetime. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The main aim of the present paper is to analyze the stochastic behavior of a cold standby system with concept of preventive maintenance, priority and maximum repair time. For this purpose, a stochastic model is developed in which initially one unit is operative and other is kept as cold standby. There is a single server who visits the system immediately as and when required. The server takes the unit under preventive maintenance after a maximum operation time at normal mode if one standby unit is available for operation. If the repair of the failed unit is not possible up to a maximum repair time, failed unit is replaced by new one. The failure time, maximum operation time and maximum repair time distributions of the unit are considered as exponentially distributed while repair and maintenance time distributions are considered as arbitrary. All random variables are statistically independent and repairs are perfect. Various measures of system effectiveness are obtained by using the technique of semi-Markov process and RPT. To highlight the importance of the study numerical results are also obtained for MTSF, availability and profit function. © 2015 Growing Science Ltd. All Right reserved.},

abstract={The main concentration of the present paper is on the cost-benefit analysis of a cold standby system with the concept of priority, preventive maintenance and arrival time of the server. For this purpose, a stochastic model is designed in which one unit is operative initially and other unit is kept as cold standby. A single repair facility is provided, which takes some time to arrive at the system to do PM and repair of the components as per the requirement of the system. Server does not do the preventive maintenance, if there is no spare unit available for use. All random variables are statistically independent. The unit after repair and preventive maintenance is considered as good as new. All times distributions are exponential except the repair, arrival time of server and preventive maintenance time distributions, which are considered as general. The expression for various important measures of system effectiveness is obtained by using semi-Markov process and regenerative point technique. The numerical study of the results for mean time to system failure (MTSF), availability and profit has also been made giving some particular values to various costs and parameters.},

abstract={Wireless networks are becoming a combination of more and more diverse and complicated networks. Handoff is a process to maintain data session continuity where mobile node changes from one base station coverage area to another base station area. Mobile maintains its existing connections via vertical handoff. In wireless environment single node mobility is known as host mobility and group of nodes moving together as single network is known as Network Mobility (NEMO). NEMO is extension of MIPv6, invented for reducing number of individual handoffs. To influence smooth mobility between these heterogeneous wireless access networks, expeditious and dependable vertical handoff (VHO) schemes are required. While taking VHO decision several parameters has to consider like received signal strength (RSS), addressable bandwidth, power intake, monetary cost, security, user predilection and etc. In this paper various handoff decision techniques based on different parameters for host mobility, and vertical handoff technique for Network mobility (NEMO) are discussed.

Moreover neighbor node detects and prevents black hole attack using real time monitoring. The new proposed method is effective for multiple sessions. The concept of broadcasting is being used in the method. Node which replies to RouteRequest (RREQ) by source is being monitored in promiscuous mode. Detection of malicious node is actually done by neighbor node of RouteReply (RREP) sender node.

abstract={This work aims to reveal the underlying effect of improved power factor on the life of Self Ballasted Fluorescent Lamps commonly termed as CFL. In the third world country like India because of cost effectiveness CFLs are still used without any power factor correction circuitry. Recently the power factor improvement tool is made compulsive for CFL and the recommended range as suggested by IEC 61000-3-2 is greater than 0.85. In addition to this the current harmonic distortion is preferred to be around 30% as per the standards. But unfortunately there are still CFLs available in the market which have less power factor in comparison with the desired standards. This has caused substantial problems not only on the generation side, but it certainly has considerable impact on the lamp performance. In the present work in order to exemplify this problem, four CFLs of 15W each from two different manufacturers are used for the experiment. Out of these four lamps, two lamps are ballast with low input power factor and instant start type. The other two are incorporated with improved input power factor having rapid start or warm start circuitry. The lamps are constantly switched ON and OFF at regular intervals. The interval was taken as 5 minutes ON and 5 minutes OFF. The lamps were subjected to this accelerated switching test. At the end of every switching cycle the electrode temperature was calculated from the ratio of hot resistance to cold resistance. It was thus observed that lamps with instant start ballast and poor power factor were unable to sustain the switching stress as compared to the lamps with rapid start ballast and improved power factor. Furthermore, the rise in electrode temperature for the lamps with improved power factor was within the desired standards. Thus it was concluded that lamps with poor power factor was more prone to early end in comparison with the other variety. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={In Bioinformatics, gene dataset experiments are generating thousands of gene expression measurements, which generally used to collect information from tissue and cell samples regarding gene expression differences. Optimum gene selection from such gene expression datasets and their classification plays an important role for disease prediction & diagnosis. Further the task ahead to understand that, what is the best way of gene selection to get maximum classification accuracy from such high dimensional gene expression dataset, whether the filter is the best way to rely upon or wrapper approach can be the best suitable, beyond that which classifier works well with filter and with wrapper? To answer the question, in this paper, the performance of the filter vs. wrapper gene selection technique is being evaluated by supervised classifiers over three well known public domain datasets viz. Ovarian Cancer, Lymphomas & Leukemia. For optimal gene selection, ReliefF method is used as a filter based gene selection and Random gene subset selection algorithm is used as a wrapper based gene selection. For classification, different linear as well as an ensemble classifiers have been tested for their performances. This paper also tries to bring the fact of timing details so that through analysis, it can get derived upon that which approach is more appropriate for better time management as well as with high accuracy of the selected dataset. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Surface geometry plays an important role in case of analyte sensing and RF switching using beams and electrodes. In general, rather than simply supported beam and diaphragm, microcantilever beams are widely preferred in BIO-MEMS and RF-MEMS for biosensing and RF switching, respectively. The lower level detection ability and simple structure make these cantilevers more applicable in many applications. The rectangular cantilever beams are most widely used in TG detection. but due to their constant or planner geometry and non-adhesion of analyte they are less sensitive in case of nano or pico level biosensing. This paper introduces the fractal surface geometry concept for increasing the deflection sensitivity corresponding to lower molecular or analyte loading. The rectangular and stepped cantilever beam structures along with fractal surface are simulated and analysed for TG molecular pressure 294.3 Pa. Both the rectangular and stepped microcantilever beams with fractal surface exhibit better free end or tip deflection (nearly 2×) as compare to the planner surface based beam. The proposed fractal concept also reduces the actuation voltage requirement for perfect switching. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={The present paper addresses the solution for gene subset selection problem with the help of proposed hybrid model for the binary class classification task under supervised learning. As established facts that filter approach is better than wrapper in terms of computational efficiency and time consumption. On the other hand, accuracy of wrapper is higher in comparison to filter. The dilemma faced by the researchers, can be minimised by developing a hybrid model to utilise the efficiency of the filter and accuracy of wrapper together to get the best possible outcome in terms of optimum accuracy. Here the selection of filter is as ReliefF algorithm and wrapper as randomised gene subset selection algorithm. The proposed model is, to first applying an accurate filter, to find out most relevant gene and further applying the efficient wrapper to extract most informative gene from the previous one and optimum gene subset is appreciated by linear as well as an ensemble classifier to classify public domain viz. leukaemia, ovarian cancer, lymphomas and prostate tumour datasets with fivefold cross validation calculation and also signifies the performance measures of the classifiers along with time measurement.

abstract={The use of mobile agents for collaborative processing in wireless sensor network has gained considerable attention. This is when mobile agents are used for data aggregation to exploit redundant and correlated data. The efficiency of agent-based data aggregation depends on the agent migration scheme. However, in general, most of the proposed schemes are centralized approach-based schemes where the sink node determines the migration paths for the agents before dispatching them in the sensor network. The main limitations with such schemes are that they need global network topology information for deriving the migration paths of the agents, which incurs additional communication overhead, since each node has a very limited communication range. In addition, a centralized approach does not provide fault tolerant and adaptive migration paths. In order to solve such problems, we have proposed a distributed approach-based scheme for determining the migration path of the agents where at each hop, the local information is used to decide the migration of the agents. In addition, we also propose a local repair mechanism for dealing with the faulty nodes. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme performs better than existing schemes in the presence of faulty nodes within the networks, and manages to report the aggregated data to the sink faster. © 2015 KIPS.},

abstract={Structuring public private partnerships (PPP) in railways is a challenge, given its technology base, and obligation as a public and affordable mode of transportation. The sector provides strong incentives for vertical integration due to economies of scope. However, it is evident from the literature that large integrated PPPs in railway systems are not feasible due to higher commercial risks. They also suffer from implicit cross subsidization since the railway infrastructure is capital intensive, common to multiple revenue sources, and fare box revenues are generally not sufficient to recover investments. This is being addressed by various unbundling approaches in recent PPPs. The common unbundling is between infrastructure, operations, and services.The objective of this research is to explore the potential of unbundling further and to come up with a framework that helps policy makers in taking macro level decisions on PPP structuring. The research disaggregates the railway system into over 40 'elements' wherein an element is the smallest unit that can be given to a party for execution. However this unbundling would result in significant horizontal and vertical interfaces between these elements.A sustainable PPP would need to limit the extent of interfaces due to transaction costs and risks. This can be achieved by bundling the elements horizontally and/or vertically into 'entities' to extract the best value for a PPP. The governing principles would be scale economies (horizontal integration), scope economies (vertical integration), need for competition (horizontal disaggregation), level playing field, transactional transparency, and need for specialization (vertical disaggregation). Additional drivers would be appetite for investment, availability of competence and accountability for an entity. The findings of the research indicate that the entity formation is one of the most crucial aspects of a PPP in railways.A consequential critical area is managing the interfaces between entities, which are subject to transaction costs and risks. These should be carefully identified and addressed by well-designed contractual agreements and independent regulation. © 2014 World Conference on Transport Research Society.},

abstract={In this study, the authors propose a novel extended continuous time birth-death model for reliability analysis of a nanocell device. A nanocell consists of conducting nanoparticles connected via randomly placed self-assembled monolayer of molecules. These molecules behave as a negative differential resistor. The mathematical expression for expected nanocell lifetime and its availability, in presence of transient errors is computed. On the basis of the model, an algorithm is developed and implemented in MATLAB, PERL and HSPICE, to automatically generate the proposed model representation for a given nanocell. It is used to estimate the success_ratio as well as the nanocell reliability, while considering the uncertainties induced by transient errors. The theoretical results for reliability are validated by simulating HSPICE model of nanocell in presence of varying defect rates. It is observed that the device reliability increases with increase in the number of nanoparticles and molecules. A lower and upper bounds for nanocell reliability are calculated in theory which is validated in simulations. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2015.},

abstract={Chemical modifications including Ag nanoparticle deposition have been performed on electrochemically formed mesoporous silicon (PS) to optimize confinement and templating of molecular systems within PS as well as to modify the electronic properties of both the host and the guest. A complete quenching of photoluminescence (PL) of PS along with a considerable change of the optical properties of the dye rhodamine 6G (R6G) in PS has been achieved. For all states of preparation of the sample, PL, UV/vis transmission spectroscopy and electrical measurements were carried out. From our transmission and electrical measurements we concluded that the quenching of PL is attributed to a fundamental disruption of the luminescence mechanism. A blue shift in the PL peak of R6G in PS compared to bulk R6G is attributed to an efficient quantum confinement effect. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.},

abstract={The purpose of the present work is to evaluate the functioning of a computer system using the concepts of imperfect fault detection of hardware parts and up-gradation of software upon their failure. A stochastic model for a data processor system consisting of two identical units-one is operative and the other kept as a standby is developed. A single repair facility is supplied to the system which plays the double function of the sensor as well as a maintenance man. Upon failure of the detector to detect the fracture of the hardware component unit immediately replaced by the maintenance man. Nonetheless, only up-gradation of the software is made upon failure. All time distribution except failures follows an arbitrary distribution while failures are exponentially dispersed. The expressions for several reliability measures are derived by making use of semi-Markov processes and regenerative point of technique.

Naïve Bayes) estimate joint probability distribution p(x,y) or likelihood p(x or y) with the help of different density estimators, which are not suitable for large data sets due to their high time and space complexities. These classifiers also make different assumptions; allow limited dependencies among attributes and estimate one-dimensional likelihood. A new generative classifier known as MassBayes, works without making any assumptions and estimates multi-dimensional likelihood. We evaluate the MassBayes and two different versions of Naïve Bayes (Naïve Bayes using Kernel Density Estimator and Naïve Bayes using Discretisation) for Pendigits data set. Our evaluation shows that MassBayes can work efficiently on large and multi-dimensional datasets.

abstract={In this paper, multi-walled carbon nanotubes are synthesized by arc-discharge and chemical vapor decomposition methods. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes are synthesized on thin film of nickel sputtered on silicon substrate by thermal chemical vapor deposition of acetylene at a temperature of 750°C. The flow of current in arc-discharge method varies in the range 50–200 A. Further arc-synthesized carbon nanotubes are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and the results are compared with nanotubes grown by chemical vapor deposition method. XRD result shows a characteristic peak (0 0 2) at 26.54° corresponding to the presence of carbon nanotubes. SEM and TEM results give morphology of as-synthesized multi-walled nanotubes. TEM results indicate synthesis of well-graphitized carbon nanotubes by arc-discharge method. Dispersion of arc-synthesized nanotubes in SDS solution under the effect of different sonication times is studied. Dispersion of nanotubes in SDS solution is analyzed using UV–vis–NIR spectroscopy and it shows an absorption peak at 260 nm. It was found that with the increase in sonication time, the absorption peak in UV–vis–NIR spectra will increase and optimum sonication time was 2 hours. Functionalization of synthesized carbon nanotubes by H2SO4 and HNO3 acids has been studied and analysis of functionalized groups has been done using FT-IR spectroscopy and compared and the results are reported in this paper. FT-IR spectroscopy verifies the presence of carboxylic groups attached to carbon nanotubes. These functional groups may change properties of carbon nanotubes and may be used in vast applications of carbon nanotubes. © 2015 The Author(s).

The charge reorganization in Dy1-xErxAl2 (x=0, 0.2), on the formation of compound, has been discussed using the valence band Compton profile data. The experimental Compton profile data unambiguously establish charge transfer from Al to Dy (Dy and Er) on formation of x=0.0 (0.2) compound, which is in tune with spin polarized relativistic Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (SPR-KKR) calculations.

To optimize the light extraction efficiency of LEDs, various types of facet-patterning have been introduced on the free surfaces of the n-GaN epitaxial layer. A drastic increase in light extraction efficiency of the LED is observed due to increase of random and multiple scattering of light through patterned surfaces. The improvement in overall light extraction efficiency for the LEDs having rectangular and hexagonal patterning in free surfaces have been estimated around 2.25 and 3.39 times of that of the LED structure with smooth free surface (i.e., without any patterning), respectively. © 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

This approach also uses the external repository of super-organisms that is used to guide other super-organisms. It guides the artificial organisms to search towards non-crowding and external regions of Pareto front.

abstract={In the present work nanofibers has been prepared by electrospinning method. Zinc Oxide nanofibrous thin film were electrospun on ITO substrate from a solution containing Poly Ethylene Oxide (PEO) and Zn(CH3COO)2.2H2O. Calcination process of ZnO/PEO composite at 600oC forms a random network of poly crystalline ZnO nanofiber. Surface morphology of the electrospun ZnO thin film, studied using FE-SEM shows a uniform, continous parallel aligned sharp nanofibers. The crystal structure and orientation of ZnO thin film was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Gas sensing characteristics were studied on a custom made chamber based on two probe resistance measurement method. The film shows a good sensitivity towards organic vapours such as methanol, ethanol, acetone and propanol. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={MANETs has become a broad area in wireless networks, because of its reduced deployment cost, ease of use, and deliverance from wires. MANETs uses a decentralized and infrastructure-less network, thus making the nodes to route its messages / data with the help of intermediate nodes. Routing in MANETs is carried out with the help of broadcasting schemes, among which MPR is found to be the effectual and uncomplicated scheme. The MPR scheme broadcasts its messages only to the selected MPR nodes. The selected MPR node may be any node in the network, and there are no obligatory and adequate conditions that provides assurance about the selected node’s integrity. In this paper, we have proposed a novel approach in the MPR node selection, by adding a security feature prior to the MPR node selection. We have verified the time constraints and efficiency with the help of localization techniques. Future events are also been discussed. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={Feature selection is an optimization problem that selects the features that have minimum redundancy and maximum relevance to improve the efficiency of algorithms. In this paper, we have proposed a novel automatic unsupervised feature selection method based on gravitational search algorithm, called AFSGSA (automatic feature selection using gravitational search algorithm). In contrast to most of existing unsupervised feature selection techniques, the proposed AFSGSA requires no prior knowledge of the data to be classified and number of features to be selected. AFSGSA determines the optimal number of features of the data-set on the run. Statistical property of data-set is used to develop a novel threshold setting concept to refine the features. A novel fitness function is also proposed to make the search more efficient. The performance of AFSGSA has been compared with recently developed well-known feature selection techniques. The experimental results reveal the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed feature selection technique over other existing techniques. © 2014 by the IETE.},

abstract={The goal of this investigation is to study the three layered (core layer, intermediate layer, and peripheral layer) tubular flow of power law fluids with variable viscosity by peristalsis in order to investigate the strength of the role played by an artificially generated intermediate layer to ease constipation.The solution is carried out under the long wavelength and low Reynolds number approximations in the wave frame of reference as the flow is creeping one.The stream functions for each layer such as core layer, intermediate layer, and peripheral layer are determined.The expressions for axial pressure gradient, interfaces, trapping, and reflux limits are obtained. The effects of power law index and viscosities on pressure across one wavelength, mechanical efficiency, and trapping are discussed numerically. It is found that the pressure required to restrain flowrates and the mechanical efficiency increase with the viscosities of the intermediate and peripheral layers as well as with the flow behaviour index. It is observed that the axisymmetric flow in intestines is less prone to constipation than two-dimensional flow and may be more easily overcome with introducing a viscous intermediate layer. © 2015 S.

abstract={A biofluid dynamics mathematical model is developed to study peristaltic flow of non-Newtonian physiological liquid in a two-dimensional asymmetric channel containing porous media as a simulation of obstructed digestive (intestinal) transport. The fractional Oldroyd-B viscoelastic rheological model is utilized. The biophysical flow regime is constructed as a wave-like motion and porous medium is simulated with a modified Darcy-Brinkman model. This model is aimed at describing the digestive transport in intestinal tract containing deposits which induce impedance. A low Reynolds number approximation is employed to eliminate inertial effects and the wavelength to diameter ratio is assumed to be large. The differential transform method (DTM), a semi-computational technique is employed to obtain approximate analytical solutions to the boundary value problem. The influences of fractional (rheological material) parameters, relaxation time, retardation time, amplitude of the wave, and permeability parameter on peristaltic flow characteristics such as volumetric flow rate, pressure difference and wall friction force are computed.

abstract={Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) has made a remarkable improvement in hardware design, resource efficiency, communication and routing protocols, and other aspects thereby, making it widely used in the current decade. Nowadays, people started preferring mobile nodes in the place of static nodes, which brought mobile sensor network into focus. Current position information always shows a key role in Mobile wireless sensor network (MWSN) and accurate localization has always been an encounter for mobile sensor nodes. Installing GPS receivers for each node would also increase network installation cost for a large network, thereby making the sensor nodes to identify its own location coordinates or location reference without using GPS, and is achieved with the help of a special node that knows its location coordinates and protocols, called anchor node. The localization process suffers some setbacks due to adversary nodes. The adversary nodes make the location process tedious by giving false location references. This paper's goal is to confer different localization techniques used by mobile sensor nodes to identify their location information and the attacks confronted during localization. Problems and future issues have also been discussed.},

abstract={Nanoporous gold (npg) produced by dealloying of Au alloys has been recently proposed for many different applications from catalysis to bio-sensors. Furthermore, Au alloys constitute an important model system in the context of corrosion, dealloying, and stress corrosion cracking. Adsorbed self-assembled monolayers of thiol molecules inhibit the dealloying reaction. On thiol-modified Cu-Au alloys dealloying finally proceeds in a localized reaction instead of a homogeneous process. Using ethanethiols as an example, we show here that thiols can be effectively removed by application of anodic oxidation. Homogeneous porosity forms then after an oxidation step. In-situ X-ray diffraction and crystal truncation rod analysis of ethanethiol-modified Au (001) confirms that a bare Au surface is recovered after a similar oxidation step. In consequence, a multi-step dealloying process including complete initial thiol-layers as well as partially or fully re-cleaned surfaces can produce different micro-cracks, providing larger scale openings, and homogeneous nanoporous Au in between. Such hierarchically structured surfaces may show superior applicability for reactions where mass transport into the porous layer plays a decisive role for the reaction rate or detection probability. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Sometimes it becomes very difficult to identify the valuable text written by some great personalities; especially when the text is not having a signature or the author is anonymous. Deserted manuscripts or documents without a title or heading can be an additional pain. It might happen that the work of dignitaries are lost or only some part of their valuable piece of work is found available in the libraries or with other storage media's. By deploying Zipf's law with the NLTK module available in python, this problem can be solved to a great extent, helping save the originality of the valuable texts and not leaving them unidentified. This can also be helpful in some real time data analysis where frequency plays an important role; plagiarism detection in written texts is one such example. NLTK is a strong toolkit which helps in extracting, segmenting, parsing, tagging and searching etc. of many natural languages with the help of python modules. In this paper it has been tried to combine Zipf's Law with NLTK to come up with a tool to identify the anonymous or deserted valuable texts. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

abstract={Interaction-centric capabilities for engaging consumers are the basis of "co-creation capabilities" of a firm. These capabilities can be used as a strategic tool to develop competitive advantage for service firms under service-dominant logic. The authors develop a "co-creation continuum" for scaling of services, based on their relative extent of co-creation capability. The study establishes consumer's knowledge about the service process or the application technology, flexibility within the service processes, level of people interaction involved, and degree of importance of the service, as the underlying factors determining co-creation capability of a service. Practicing managers can use this continuum to effectively develop consumer co-creation strategies, by gauging the existing capabilities of their firm and hence, focusing on key areas of improvement. This research also conceptualizes a "co-creation willingness matrix," which is helpful in classification of services based on the firm-consumer willingness to co-create. This classification is useful for the firms lying on the disadvantageous end of the co-creation continuum, to reap the benefits of high level of consumer value co-creation by displaying higher willingness to co-create and by generating consumers' willingness to co-create by adopting suitable strategies. This article also sets out agenda for future research. © 2014 Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

So web applications security is today's most significant battlefield between attackers and resources of web service. It is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. By considering recent attacks it has been found that major attacks in Web Applications have been carried out even when system having most significant network level security. Poor input validation mechanisms that using in Web Applications shall causes to launching vulnerable web applications, which easy to exploit easy in future stages. Critical Web Application Vulnerabilities like Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and Injections (SQL, PHP, LDAP, SSL, XML, Command, and Code) are happen because of base level Validations, and it is enough to update system in unauthorized way or may be causes to exploit the system. In this paper we present those issues in data validations strategies, to avoid deployment of vulnerable web applications. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Traditional naval architecture includes all the departments concatenated into a single physical network and if it has to be separated, then physically different network is formed. This paper strives on removing the logical single network whilst maintaining the physical network intact on all the departments by implementing VLAN. Various automation systems like IBS, IPMS, CCTV, APMS and communication systems could be on the same physical network (reducing the cabling) and logically separated leading to isolation of network traffic to specified systems and smooth running of the automation systems without additional load in it, further as VLAN segment the network into different broadcast domains so the packets are only delivered between ports that are combined for the same VLAN. The latency is of key importance, to boost this up, further rapid spanning tree protocol; RSTP is used to get better results. The monitoring software; wireshark was used to compare the analysis of latency, considering real time architectural parameters. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Localization is extensively used in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) to identify the current location of the sensor nodes. A WSN consist of thousands of nodes that make the installation of GPS on each sensor node expensive and moreover GPS will not provide exact localization results in an indoor environment. Manually configuring location reference on each sensor node is also not possible in the case of dense network. This gives rise to a problem where the sensor nodes must identify its current location without using any special hardware like GPS and without the help of manual configuration. Localization techniques makes the deployment of WSNs economical. Most of the localization techniques are carried out with the help of anchor node or beacon node, which knows its present location. Based on the location information provided by the anchor node or beacon node, other nodes localize themselves. In this paper we present a succinct survey on the localization techniques used in wireless sensor networks covering its problems and research gap. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

abstract={In recent years, nanoscience and nanotechnology have emerged as a new area of fundamental science and are receiving global attention due to their extensive applications. Conventionally nanoparticles were manufactured by physical and chemical techniques. The recent development and implementation of new technologies have led to a new trend, the nano-revolution unfolding the role of plants in bio- and green synthesis of nanoparticles which seems to have drawn a quite unequivocal attention to the synthesis of stable nanoparticles. Although nanoparticles can be synthesized through many conventional methods, biological route of the synthesis is more competent than the physical and chemical techniques. Biologically synthesized nanoparticles have enjoyed an upsurge of applications in various sectors. Hence, the present study envisions biosynthesis of nanoparticles from plants which are emerging as nanofactories. Hence, the present review summarizes the literature reported thus far and envisions plants as emerging sources of nanofactories along with applications, the mechanism behind phytosynthesis of nanoparticles and the mechanism of antibacterial action of nanoparticles. © 2014 Vietnam Academy of Science & Technology},

abstract={In the present paper, some reliability measures of a computer system of two cold standby identical units are obtained using a semi-Markov process and a regenerative point technique. For this purpose, a reliability model is proposed by considering independent h/w and s/w failure. Initially, one unit is operative and another is kept as spare in cold standby. A single server is provided to conduct preventive maintenance, repair, replacement and up-gradation of the components upon their failure. Then, a maximum operation time system undergoes preventive maintenance, directly from normal mode. If the repair of the h/w is not possible by the server up to a pre-specific time, it is replaced by a new one with some replacement time. However, only up-gradation of the software by a new one is made whenever s/w fails to execute the desired function properly. Priority to h/w repair is given over h/w replacement and s/w up-gradation. The failure time distribution of the h/w and s/w follows a negative exponential while the distributions of preventive maintenance, repair, up-gradation and replacement time are taken as arbitrary with different probability density functions. To depict the importance of the study, graphs are drawn for a particular case with fixed values of other parameters and costs. © 2014 Jordan Journal of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering.},

abstract={In this information age, providing security over the Internet is a major issue. Internet security is all about trust at a remote distance, because we are dealing with everyone remotely and not able to confirm identity or authenticity in the traditional sense. To increase the password authentication a scheme was proposed by Chun-Ta Li which is basically a smart card-based password authentication and update scheme. The Chun's scheme provides user anonymity and eviction of unauthorized users. In our research work we have crypt analyze the Chun's method and shown that it is vulnerable to various types of attacks: insider attack, off line password verifier attack, stolen verifier attack and impersonating attack. To overcome the security vulnerability of Chun's scheme, we have proposed an advance scheme of password authentication and user anonymity using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and stegnography. The proposed scheme also provides privacy to the client. Based on scheme performance criteria such as immunity to known attacks and functional features, we came to the conclusion that the proposed scheme is much efficient and solves several hard security threats. © 2014 IEEE.},

It is observed that the surface of plasma treated polyester is more hydrophilic due to incorporation of nitrogenous polar functional groups and shows different conformational composition and crystallinity. The ATR–FTIR results clearly indicate the conversion of trans ethylene glycol residue to gauche one after plasma treatment and thus reduction in crystallinity. Plasma treatment has shown synergetic effect on dye uptake. Natural dyeing of plasma treated polyester with ‘Rubia cordifolia’ has shown 65% improvement in colour depth in comparison to untreated polyester fabric. © 2014 Indian Journal of Fibre & Textile Research.

abstract={Expressed sequence tags (EST) are potential source for the development of genic microsatellite markers, gene discovery, comparative genomics, and other genomic studies. In the present study, 7630 ESTs were examined from NCBI for SSR identification and characterization. A total of 263 SSRs were identified with an average density of one SSR/4.2 kb (3.4% frequency). Analysis revealed that trinucleotide repeats (47.52%) were most abundant followed by tetranucleotide (19.77%), dinucleotide (19.01%), pentanucleotide (9.12%), and hexanucleotide repeats (4.56%). Functional annotation was done through homology search and gene ontology, and 35 EST-SSRs were selected. Primer pairs were designed for evaluation of cross transferability and polymorphism among 11 plants belonging to five different families. Total 402 alleles were generated at 155 loci with an average of 2.6 alleles/locus and the polymorphic information content (PIC) ranged from 0.15 to 0.92 with an average of 0.75. The cross transferability ranged from 34.84% to 98.06% in different plants, with an average of 67.86%. Thus, the validation study of annotated 35 EST-SSR markers which correspond to particular metabolic activity revealed polymorphism and evolutionary nature in different families of Angiospermic plants. © 2014 Shamshad ul Haq et al.},

abstract={Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are on a steady rise in the current decade because of its progressions in hardware design, resource efficiency, communication and routing protocols, and other aspects. Recently, people started preferring mobile nodes in the place of static nodes, which brought mobile sensor network into focus. Location information always plays a key role in Mobile wireless sensor network (MWSN) and precise localization has always been a challenge for mobile sensor nodes. Deploying GPS receivers for each node would render network deployment cost for a dense network. The unavailability of GPS in indoor and underground environment has also put the installation of GPS into question. This makes the sensor nodes to identify its location coordinates or location reference without using GPS, and is achieved with the help of a special node that knows its location coordinates and protocols, called beacon node. This paper’s goal is to confer different localization techniques used by mobile sensor nodes to identify their location information. Problems and future issues have also been discussed. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.},

abstract={In this paper reliability measures of a two-unit cold standby system are evaluated considering the ideas of arrival time of the server, preventive maintenance of the system after a maximum operation time and replacement of the failed unit if its repair is not possible by the server in a pre-specific time (called maximum repair time). The failure time of the unit follows negative exponential distribution while the distribution of arrival time, preventive maintenance time, repair time and replacement time of the unit are taken as arbitrary with different probability density functions. The system has been analyzed stochastically in detail using semi-Markov process and regenerative point technique. The behavior of some important measures of system effectiveness has been observed graphically giving particular values to various parameters and costs. © 2013, UK Simulation Society.

abstract={Major industrial sectors like automotive, aerospace and others are increasingly using adhesively bonded high performance polymers in their structural parts. Unfortunately, the surface of polymers is chemically inert and, therefore, exhibits poor adhesion properties. It is established that for successful application of polymeric materials to form structural parts using adhesive bonding, they need to have certain surface properties like polarity/high surface energy. This review article discusses the effect of modifying polymer surfaces by different plasma techniques on the surface energy and surface roughness of the polymers which play an important role in improving adhesive bond strength.},

abstract={In this manuscript, a fast improved technique is proposed for handwritten Devanagari numerals recognition. Today's scenario demands along with the high recognition rate require a technique which is fast and computationally efficient. Existing technique Foreground sub-sampling (FS) is based on the horizontal and vertical projection computation at each granularity level to find the division points. Here we proposed a technique through which the computation of horizontal and vertical projection at each granularity level becomes fast and efficient by using vertical and horizontal integral image. If sample image is 90 by 90 sized by FS technique at granularity level 3, 62100 addition (+) operations are required to find 85 division points while in our proposed technique only 18000 addition (+) operations are enough to compute same features. So the computation time of foreground subsampling technique is reduced 3 times. Our database (handwritten Devanagari numerals) is given by ISI (Indian Statistical Institute), Kolkata. The size of training and testing data are 18783, 3763 respectively and 98.97 % recognition accuracy is achieved.},

abstract={Global production of textiles products has increased more than 72.5 million metric tonnes of which synthetic fibers form an important part [1]. In fact, the production of natural fibers surpasses by synthetic fibers with more than 55% of products in the textile industry [2]. Polyester is the most used synthetic fiber first commercially produced by the du Pont Company. Polyesters are made from chemical substances found mainly in petroleum and are manufactured in three basic forms-fibers, films and plastics of which polyester fibers used to make fabrics is the largest segment. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) (Fig. 1) is the most common polyester used for textile manufacturing. PET is synthesized from ethylene glycol with either terephthalic acid (Fig. 2) or its methyl ester in the presence of an antimony catalyst under high temperature and vacuum to achieve high molecular weights needed to form useful fibers. Production of polyester accounted of 30.3 million metric tonnes in 2008 representing about 72% of the entire man-made fiber [1]. The 2009 global aggregate polyethylene terephthalate output summed up 49.2 m tonnes, of which PET fiber accounted for about two-thirds, whereas PET for packages and films 34% [1]. In 2010, the world textile industry has experienced the most potent growth in 25 years. Manufacturing volumes of natural and manmade fibers rocketed upwards by 8.6%, or 6.4 million tonnes, at 80.8 million tonnes of polyester indus- polyester indus-industrial filament yarn jumped up by spectacular 37%. Viscose fibers produced a record-breaking growth of 17% [2]. PET fibers are expected to account for 50% of the world fibers production in 2012 [1]. © 2013 by Apple Academic Press, Inc.},

abstract={Visual cryptography (VC) is a useful technique that combines the notions of perfect ciphers and secret sharing in cryptography. VC takes a binary image (the secret) and divides it into two or more pieces known as shares. When the shares are printed on transparencies and then superimposed, the secret can be recovered. No computer participation is required. There are various measures on which performance of visual cryptography scheme depends, such as pixel expansion, contrast, security, accuracy, computational complexity, share generated is meaningful or meaningless, type of secret images (either binary or color) and number of secret images(either single or multiple) encrypted by the scheme. In this paper, we will summarize the developments of visual cryptography since its birth in 1994, introduce the main research topics in this area where researchers have been contributing and outline the application of these schemes. © Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2013.},

abstract={Recently, Roy et al., published the synthetic procedure of biologically active mesoionic heterocycles. They have observed a peculiar mechanistic feature that substituted mesoionic derivatives do not undergo cyclisation whereas the unsubstituted one readily participates into the cyclisation. It is also revealed from their experimental study that sulphur containing mesoionic heterocycles are less reactive as compared to the oxygen containing derivatives. In this report, we have evaluated theoretical DFT based local reactivity parameters like fukui functions, local softness and local philicity indices to validate the above mentioned experimental facts. We have also calculated the global reactivity parameters to explain the reactivity differences between the substituted and unsubstituted mesoionic derivatives. The nice correlation between the experimental and theoretical counterpart supports our venture. © 2013 by Apple Academic Press, Inc.},
