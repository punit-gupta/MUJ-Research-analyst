Abstract = {{A series of multifunctional carbohydrazide based chromofluorescent
   sensor molecules derived from carbohydrazide, 4-formyl-1-substituted
   phenyl-pyrazole-3-carboxylate and 2-hydroxy-naphthaldehyde were
   successfully designed and synthesized. The synthesized sensor molecules
   exhibit significant red shift in their absorption spectra with visual
   color changes on interaction with Cu(II) and Zn(II) ions. In addition,
   the optimized sensor showed excellent selectivity towards Cu(II) and
   Zn(II) ions with fluorescence turn off and turn on modes respectively.
   Along with this, anion recognition studies were carried out using
   UV-visible and fluorescence spectrophotometric titrations which revealed
   that synthesized sensors also exhibit selective sensing of F-, CH3COO-
   and H2PO4- ions via H-bond interaction and subsequent deprotonation to
   elicit distinct visual color change from light yellow to orange with
   significant quenching in its emission intensity. Furthermore, the
   in-situ prepared sensor-anion adduct solution exhibited colorimetric
   ``On-Off{''}sensing of Cu(II) and Zn(II) ions, which was confirmed
   through UV-visible titration experiments.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with unsteady oscillatory flow of viscous
   incompressible fluid with heat \& mass transfer in a horizontal channel
   partially occupied by porous medium following the Darcy-Brinkman model.
   The inner territory of the channel consists of two regions; one of them
   is filled with porous material and second is clear fluid. At the porous
   medium fluid interface, interfacial coupling conditions for the fluid
   velocity, temperature and concentration were used to derive the
   analytical solution. Some standard values of Schmidt number like
   Hydrogen(0.22), Helium(0.30), Amonia(0.78); Eckert number (0.25, 0.5, 1,
   2) and Prandtl number for water(0.71) and Air(7.0) was considered in
   this paper. The effects of pertinent physical fluid parameter like
   porosity, viscosity ratio, density ratio etc. on velocity, temperature
   and concentration distribution are considered and demonstrated through
   graphs. Heavier diffusive species and high molecular diffusivity ratio
   decreases the fluid concentration throughout the region. Increasing
   values of Prandtl number upsurge the fluid temperature throughout the
   region.}},

Abstract = {{In this research study, empirical mathematical models for cutting forces
   and surface roughness have been developed to investigate the effect of
   axial depth of cut, feed, radial depth of cut and cutting speed in
   high-speed ball-end milling of Al2014-T6. Ball-end milling experiments
   have been planned using central composite design based on response
   surface methodology. The mathematical models have been established and
   tested for adequacy. A full quadratic model has been adopted for
   modelling. It has been found that axial depth of cut is the most
   dominant cutting parameter for the tangential and axial cutting forces,
   accounting for 49.38 and 47.12\% contributions, respectively. Radial
   depth of cut is the most dominant parameter for radial force and
   contributes 69.94\% for it. Results also revealed that force components
   decrease with increase in cutting speed. There is very small variation
   in cutting force components in the cutting speed range of 75-150 m/min
   at lower values of axial and radial depth of cut. Surface roughness is
   effected by cutting speed largely followed by feed. Multi-objective
   optimization has been performed using composite desirability to optimize
   the cutting parameters for minimum surface roughness and cutting forces
   simultaneously. Confirmation tests have been conducted using optimal set
   of cutting parameters. The results of confirmation tests are very close
   to the predicted results.}},

Title = {{INBREEDED GA FOR OPTIMAL DR ALLOCATION IN DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING-JOE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Although the phenomenon of inbreeding is quite usual in animals, but has
   not been yet attempted to enhance the performance of genetic algorithms
   (GAs). The crossover operator of GA can be modified using the concept of
   inbreeding in animals. This single measure enhances the pace of GA.
   However, GA stagnates due to inbreeding, as in animals, which is then
   overcome by suggesting mandatory mutation in addition to the
   conventional mutation. This paper proposes inbreeded GA (IGA) which is
   then applied to efficiently solve the simultaneous optimal allocation of
   shunt capacitors and distributed generations in distribution systems
   while considering realities of practical distribution systems. The
   objective considered is to maximize annual energy loss reduction. The
   proposed method is applied on the benchmark IEEE 33-bus test
   distribution system. The application results obtained shows the
   supremacy of IGA over GA and other existing metaheuristics.}},

Abstract = {{Automobile emissions are the main source of greenhouse gases (GHG)
   accumulation in environment. As old engines (Euro III or earlier)
   produce more emissions and it will be difficult to entirely stop their
   usage especially in developing and underdeveloped nations, it is desired
   that appropriate emission reduction technologies are tested on such
   engines to analyze their feasibility and economical acceptability. While
   most such studies have been conducted on constant speed stationary
   engines and modern engines, this study tried to analyze the
   effectiveness of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system on a Euro-1,
   water-cooled, direct injection, variable speed, compression ignition
   (C.I.) engine in a laboratory setup in India. This was done by testing
   an electronic control unit (ECU)-controlled EGR valve running the engine
   on different speeds; with different torques, as also with varying EGR
   percentages. Then optimum value of EGR valve opening for each set of
   engine speed and torque was determined, that is, corresponding to
   minimum oxides of nitrogen (NOx). Optimum EGR valve position was
   programmatically fed, for each set of torque and engine speed (in RPM),
   into EGR ECU and then the engine was run at varying speeds and torques
   and the emissions were verified in the automated mode. It was found that
   using EGR, NOx emissions were substantially reduced (average 45\%
   reduction), without significantly impacting the engine performance.
   However, smoke emission increased with EGR. In order to counter the
   adverse effects, additional emission reduction technologies should be
   used in tandem with EGR. (c) 2017 American Institute of Chemical

Abstract = {{Quaternary and ternary alloy semiconductors offer an extra degree of
   flexibility in terms of bandgap tuning. Modifications in the wave
   functions and alterations in optical transitions in quaternary and
   ternary QW (quantum well) heterostructures due to external uniaxial
   strain provide valuable insights on the characteristics of the
   heterostructure. This paper reports the optical gain in strained
   InGaAsP/GaAsSb type-II QW heterostructure (well width = 20 angstrom)
   under external uniaxial strain at room temperature (300 K). The entire
   heterostructure is supposed to be grown on InP substrate
   pseudomorphically. Band structure, wave functions, energy dispersion and
   momentum matrix elements of the heterostructure have been computed. 6 x
   6 diagonalised (k) over right arrow . (p) over right arrow Hamiltonian
   matrix of the system is evaluated and Luttinger-Kohn model has been
   applied for the band structure and wavefunction calculations. TE mode
   optical gain spectrum in the QW-heterostructure under uniaxial strain
   along {[}110] is calculated. Optical gain of the heterostructure as a
   function of 2D carrier density and temperature variation is
   investigated. The variation of the peak optical gain as a function of As
   and Sb fractions in InGaAsP as a barrier and GaAsSb as a well
   respectively is exhibited. For a charge carrier injection of 5 x
   10(12)/cm(2), the TE optical gain is 3952 cm(-1) at room temperature
   under no external uniaxial strain. Significant increase in TE mode
   optical gain is observed under high external uniaxial strain (1, 5 and
   10 GPa) along {[}110] within IR (Infrared region) region. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{Proteases account for nearly 60\% of the industrial enzyme market and
   have wide applications. Present study has been designed to isolate and
   screen protease producing fungi from various soil samples of Jaipur
   region and optimum physico-cultural conditions for enhanced protease
   production from selected isolate was also investigated. Isolate fungi
   were screened by growing them onto skim milk agar plates and the zone of
   proteolysis was noted. Isolate FGCC/BLS2 showed maximum hydrolysis
   capacity when compared to wild type positive reference strain
   Aspergillus flavus. Molecular. Characterization of the FGCC/BLS 2
   isolate confirmed it as Cladosporium sp. PAB 2014 strain FGCC/BLS 2
   (Submitted to Gen Bank: Accession Number KU 752193). The highest enzyme
   activity was obtained with production media at 120 hour (60.9 +/- 2.17
   U/mg protein) with 2\% inoculums (63.19 +/- 0.59 U/mg protein), pH 7
   (63.77 +/- 2.45 U/mg protein), dextrose as the carbon source (63.9 +/-
   1.63U/mg protein) and tryptone as a nitrogen source (66.9 +/- 2.34 U/mg

Abstract = {{This paper predict the effect of the object's morphology on the final
   accuracy of the scanned data, for the case of contactless laser
   scanning. On the basis of the scanned objects morphology, two important
   process parameters are specified namely scanning angle and distance of
   the laser from the part surface. Experiments have been performed with
   different scanning conditions using full factorial design. An analytical
   prediction model for determining the standard deviation of the final
   surface is developed in terms of the aforesaid scanning parameters using
   response surface methodology (RSM). Furthermore, the optimal scanning
   parameters are predicted after comparing two almost unexplored nature
   inspired algorithms i.e. Whale Optimization Algorithm(WOA) andMoth-Flame
   Optimization (MFO). Finally, two realistic non-trivial case studies are
   considered for validation of the proposed methodology. The result shows
   that the standard deviation of the final reverse engineered models
   significantly reduced by 21.6\% and 13.77\%. The adopted methodology
   provides the optimal combination of morphological scanning process
   parameters with a considerable reduction in standard deviation for final
   scanned surface models.}},

   effectively manages the load imbalance. Virtual Machine (VM) migration

   loaded VM help to decrease the queue size and increase the throughput of
   the system. Effective resource management mechanism improves the
   performance and reduces the service level agreement (SLA) violations.
   Although researchers did the lot of work to manage load imbalance, but
   still need improvement. In this paper, proposed Dynamic weighted Live
   Migration (DWLM) Load balancing algorithm to manage the load imbalance
   problem. The proposed experiment result compares with another two

   energy loss and conductivity of both compounds are performed to validate
   their applicability for solar photovoltaic and other optoelectronic

Abstract = {{Mycosporine-like amino acids are the most common group of transparent
   ultraviolet radiation absorbing intracellular secondary metabolites.
   These molecules absorb light in the range of ultraviolet-A and -B with a
   maximum absorbance between 310 and 362nm. Cyanobacteria might have faced
   the most deleterious ultraviolet radiation, which leads to an evolution
   of ultraviolet protecting mycosporine-like amino acids for efficient
   selection in the environment. In the last 30 years, scientists have
   investigated various cyanobacteria for novel mycosporine-like amino
   acids, applying different induction techniques. This review organizes
   all the cyanobacterial groups that produce various mycosporine-like
   amino acids. We found out that cyanobacteria belonging to orders
   Synechococcales, Chroococcales, Oscillatoriales, and Nostocales are
   frequently studied for the presence of mycosporine-like amino acids,
   while orders Gloeobacterales, Spirulinales, Pleurocapsales, and
   Chroococcidiopsidales are still need to be investigated. Nostoc and
   Anabaena strains are major studied genus for the mycosporine-like amino

   their oxime derivatives to pure alumina were carried out by the sol-gel
   technique. The powder XRD patterns of all the formed alumina suggest
   formation of cubic phase (y-alumina) with average crystallites size of

Abstract = {{This paper presents a modified particle swarm optimization (MPSO)
   algorithm for the evaluation of geometric characteristics defining form
   and function of planar surfaces. The geometric features of planar
   surfaces are decomposed into four components; namely straightness,
   flatness, perpendicularity, and parallelism. A non-linear minimum zone
   objective function is formulated mathematically for each planar surface
   geometric characteristic. Finally, the result of the proposed method is
   compared with previous work on the same problem and with other nature
   inspired algorithms. The results demonstrate that the proposed MPSO
   algorithm is more efficient and accurate in comparison to other
   algorithms and is well suited for effective and accurate evaluation of
   planar surface characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{Neuroinflammation, the condition associated with the hyperactivity of
   immune cells within the CNS (central nervous system), has recently been
   linked to a host range of neurodegenerative disorders. Targeting
   neuroinflammation could be of prime importance as recent research
   highlights the beneficial aspects associated with modulating the
   inflammatory mediators associated with the CNS. One of the main
   obstructions in neuroinflammatory treatments is the hindrance posed by
   the blood-brain barrier for the delivery of drugs. Hence, research has
   focused on novel modes of transport for drugs to cross the barrier
   through drug delivery and nanotechnology approaches. In this Review, we
   highlight the therapeutic advancement made in the field of
   neurodegenerative disorders by focusing on the effect neuroinflammation

Abstract = {{Biomimetic synthesis of metal nanoparticles (NPs) is safe and

   the soil fungi Penicillium chrysogenum strain Fungal germplasm
   collection centre/ BLS1 was isolated, characterized and explored to
   synthesize extracellular silver NPs (AgNPs) under optimised conditions.
   The synthesis of AgNPs was investigated using ultraviolet (UV)-visible
   spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR),
   transmission electron microscope (TEM) and dynamic light scattering
   (DLS) analysis. Process optimisation exhibited AgNPs synthesis within 8
   h using 2 mM AgNO3 at pH 11 and temperature 70 degrees C. TEM analysis
   revealed polydispersed ellipsoidal shaped AgNPs with average particle
   size 96.8 nm as measured by DLS. AgNPs showed negative zeta potential
   that confers surface stability in solution. FTIR spectra confirmed the
   presence of protein bound to AgNPs. Antibacterial activity against
   Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus by the
   AgNPs (100 ppm) was demonstrated by counting colony forming unit , disc
   diffusion, and growth kinetics assay. Additionally radial assay revealed
   antifungal activity of AgNPs (100 ppm) against phytopathogenic fungi
   Sclerotinia sclerotiorum Microbial type culture collection 8785.
   Furthermore, AgNPs (100 ppm) did not show any cytotoxic effects on human
   Red blood cells. Therefore, this novel fungal strain can be utilised for
   biofabrication of AgNPs under optimised conditions and have shown strong
   antimicrobial property.}},

   synthesized by the reactions of {[}V(NPh)(O (i) Pr)(3)] (A) with
   2-acetylfuryl oxime in different molar ratios in anhydrous benzene. All
   these new derivatives have been characterized by elemental analyses,
   Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance
   (H-1, C-13 \{H-1\}), V-51) and fast atom bombardment mass spectral
   studies. Spectral studies appear to be indicating mono-dentate and
   bi-dentate mode of attachment of the oximato moieties in the solution
   and solid state, respectively. Fast atom bombardment mass study of one
   of the representative derivative, {[}V(NPh)\{(ONC)(CH3)(C4H3O-2)\}(3)]
   (3) suggests the monomeric nature of all these complexes.
   Thermogravimetric curve of {[}V(NPh)\{(ONC)(CH3)(C4H3O-2)\}(3)] (3)

   in (vn) is confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and
   nuclear magnetic resonance spectral studies as well as by the
   thermogravimetric study. The X-ray diffraction patterns of vanadia, (a)
   and (b) indicate formation of orthorhombic phase and the scanning
   electron microscope images of (a) and (b) show rod like morphology of
   the crystallites. Absorption spectra of vanadia, (a) and (b) indicate
   energy band gaps of 2.62 and 2.43 eV, respectively.

Abstract = {{The present article studies theoretically the electrokinetic pumping of
   nanofluids with heat and mass transfer in a micro-channel under
   peristaltic waves, a topic of some interest in medical nano-scale
   electro-osmotic devices. The microchannel walls are deformable and
   transmit periodic waves. The Chakraborty-Roy nanofluid electrokinetic
   formulation is adopted in which Joule heating effects are incorporated.
   Soret and Dufour cross-diffusion effects are also considered. Under low
   Reynolds number (negligible inertial effects), long wavelength and Debye
   linearization approximations, the governing partial differential
   equations for mass, momentum, energy and solute concentration
   conservation are derived with appropriate boundary conditions at the
   micro-channel walls. The merging model features a number of important
   thermo-physical, electrical and nanoscale parameter, namely thermal and
   solutal Grashof numbers, the Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity (maximum
   electro-osmotic velocity) and Joule heating to surface heat flux ratio.
   Closed-form solutions are derived for the solute concentration,
   temperature, axial velocity, averaged volumetric flow rate, pressure
   difference across one wavelength, and stream function distribution in
   the wave frame. Additionally expressions are presented for the surface
   shear stress function at the wall (skin friction coefficient), wall heat
   transfer rate (Nusselt number) and wall solute mass transfer rate
   (Sherwood number). The influence of selected parameters on these flow
   variables is studied with the aid of graphs. Bolus formation is also
   visualized and analyzed in detail. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 26}},
Abstract = {{Here we report an in-silico approach for identification,
   characterization and validation of deleterious non-synonymous SNPs
   (nsSNPs) in the interleukin-8 gene using three steps. In first step,
   sequence homology-based genetic analysis of a set of 50 coding SNPs
   associated with 41 rsIDs using SIFT (Sorting Intolerant from Tolerant)
   and PROVEAN (Protein Variation Effect Analyzer) identified 23 nsSNPs to
   be putatively damaging/deleterious in at least one of the two tools
   used. Subsequently, structure-homology based PolyPhen-2 (Polymorphism
   Phenotyping) analysis predicted 9 of 23 nsSNPs (K4T, E31A, E31K, S41Y,
   I55N, P59L, P59S, L70P and V88D) to be damaging. According to the
   conditional hypothesis for the study, only nsSNPs that score
   damaging/deleterious prediction in both sequence and structural
   homology-based approach will be considered as `high-confidence' nsSNPs.
   In step 2, based on conservation of amino acid residues, stability
   analysis, structural superimposition, RSMD and docking analysis, the
   possible structural-functional relationship was ascertained for
   high-confidence nsSNPs. Finally, in a separate analysis (step 3), the
   IL-8 deregulation has also appeared to be an important prognostic marker
   for detection of patients with gastric and lung cancer. This study, for
   the first time, provided in-depth insights on the effects of amino acid
   substitutions on IL-8 protein structure, function and disease
   association.}},

Title = {{Natural convective heat transfer analysis of MHD unsteady Carreau

Volume = {{317}},

Abstract = {{The present numerical simulations are carried out to investigate the
   effect of viscous dissipation, temperature dependent viscosity and heat
   source/sink on magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) unsteady Carreaue nanofluid
   over a cone filled with different alloy nanoparticles. We considered two
   different types of alloy nanoparticle namely nickel chromium iron alloy
   (Nimonic 80A) and titanium aluminum vanadium alloy (Ti\%6Al\%4V). The
   governing equations of the flow are solved using the Runge-Kutta and
   Newton's method. The present numerical results are compared with the
   previous study and found agreement with the uncertainty of +/- 2.5\%.
   Effects of various non dimensional parameters such as Eckert number,
   power index parameter, volume fraction, heat source/sink parameter,
   viscous variation parameter and semi-vertical angle of the cone on the
   momentum and thermal boundary layer including the friction factor
   coefficients and local Nusselt number are presented and analyzed for two
   different alloy considered in the present study. It is found that the
   viscous variation parameter enables to enhance the heat transfer rate.
   The Ti\%6Al\%4V alloy has higher friction factor coefficient along the
   azimuthal direction of the flow while Nimonic 80A alloy boosts up the
   friction coefficient along the tangential direction. It is worth to
   mention that the heat transfer rate of Nimonic 80A alloy is higher than
   that of Ti\%6Al\%4V alloy. Hence, Nimonic 80A alloy signifies a better
   thermal performance than the Ti\%6Al\%4V alloy. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{This paper presents a mathematical model for simulating viscous,
   incompressible, steady-state blood flow containing copper nanoparticles
   and coupled heat transfer through a composite stenosed artery with
   permeable walls. Wall slip hydrodynamic and also thermal buoyancy
   effects are included. The artery is simulated as an isotropic elastic
   tube, following Joshi et al. (2009), and a variable viscosity
   formulation is employed for the flowing blood. The equations governing
   the transport phenomena are non-dimensionalized and the resulting
   boundary value problem is solved analytically in the steady state
   subject to physically appropriate boundary conditions. Numerical
   computations are conducted to quantify the effects of relevant
   hemodynamic, thermophysical and nanoscale parameters emerging in the
   model on velocity and temperature profiles, wall shear stress, impedance
   resistance and also streamline distributions. The model may be
   applicable to drug fate transport modeling with nanoparticle agents and
   also to the optimized design of nanoscale medical devices for diagnosing
   stenotic diseases in circulatory systems.}},

Abstract = {{Background and objectives: This paper aims to investigate the unsteady
   flow of two types of nanofluids i.e Copper water nanofluids and Silver
   water nanofluids) through finite length non-uniform channel driven by
   peristaltic sinusoidal wave propagations.
   Methods: The governing equations are reduced in linear form using
   dimensional analysis and considering the low Reynolds number and large
   wavelength approximations. The time dependent temperature field, axial
   velocity, transverse velocity and pressure difference are obtained
   analytically in closed form solution. Trapping phenomenon is also
   discussed with the help of contour plots of stream function. A
   comparative study of pure water (Newtonian fluid), Copper water
   nanofluids and Silver water nanofluids under the influence of relevant
   physical parameters is made in graphical form and also discussed. The
   effects of absorption parameter and Grashof number on velocity profiles,
   temperature profiles and pressure distribution along the length of
   channel are examined.
   Results conclusions: The computational results reveal that the velocity
   profile is maximum for Silver water nanofluids however, it is least for
   Copper water nanofluids. It is also concluded the temperature profile is
   more for pure water in comparison to Silver water and Copper water
   nanofluids. This model is applicable to design, micro-peristaltic pumps
   which help in Nanoparticle-based targeted drug delivery and to transport
   the sensitive or corrosive fluids, sanitary fluids, slurries and noxious
   fluids in nuclear industry. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{MATERIALS CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},

Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{The poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) polymer blend films were prepared
   by solution casting method with varying PolyChloroTriFluoroEthylene
   (PCTFE) concentrations (1-5 wt \%). The crystallinity, bonding behavior
   and disorder in the films were investigated with X-ray diffraction
   (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), UV-visible and ellipsometry
   techniques, while surface morphology was studied using Atomic force
   microscopy (AFM). The nanocrystalline nature of PMMA is seen to be
   preserved in the blends although there are clear indications of bond
   modifications. The addition of PCTFE results in the improvement of
   overall crystallinity of the films via the interaction among PMMA and
   degraded PCTFE molecules when the films are casted from diluted
   solutions. In agreement, corresponding disorder in terms of Urbach
   energy shows a decreasing trend upon inclusion of more and more PCTFE
   molecules. Micro-Raman spectra are dominated by fluorescence background,
   which is proposed as arising from degraded PCTFE. Supporting this, FOR
   spectra also shows modifications in bonding as a function of PCTFE
   percentage, but this bond modification is not enough to produce
   refractive index variation in the sample, which is dominated by the host
   PMMA contribution for all the PCTFE concentrations. The study suggests
   the useful range of PCTFE concentration in which PMMA host properties
   can be modified for optimizing optical and structural properties without
   much degradation of PCTFE. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to study the Bodewadt flow of a magnetic
   nanofluid in the presence of geothermal viscosity. The effects of
   porosity on an unsteady boundary layer flow of water-based magnetic
   nanofluids over a uniformly heated stationary disk are discussed
   numerically. Fluid viscosity is considered as a function of both depth
   and temperature. The Runge-Kutta fourth-order method along with the
   shooting technique is employed for solving a set of coupled ordinary
   differential equations. The computed results reveal that heat transfer
   is appreciably enhanced with more porosity and rotation of the fluid.
   Also, varying the fluids Prandtl number from 20 to 80, the rate of heat
   transfer increases by 93.35\% and faster cooling of the system occurs.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study is to investieate the effect of fiber orientation

   the critical buckling strength, experimentally and by using nonlinear
   finite element analysis. The composite laminated plates are simply
   supported and subjected to axial compression load. Nonlinear FEA results
   using ANSYS have good agreement with the experimental results. FEA
   results showed that the outer layers have the most significant influence
   on the buckling strength of the composite laminated material.
   Furthermore, placing carbon fiber reinforced layers in the outer surface
   of the basalt-carbon/epoxy hybrid laminates results in significant
   increase in the critical buckling load compared to placing basalt fiber
   reinforced layers in the outer surface. It is also concluded that
   {[}O2C/OB/+/- 45B]s laminate is the best combination of the hybrid

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR LIQUIDS}},

Abstract = {{Biomimetic propulsion mechanisms are increasingly being explored in
   engineering sciences. Peristalsis is one of the most efficient of these
   mechanisms and offers considerable promise in microscale fluidics.
   Electrokinetic peristalsis has recently also stimulated significant
   attention. Electrical and magnetic fields also offer an excellent mode
   for regulating flows. Motivated by novel applications in
   electro-conductive microchannel transport systems, the current article
   investigates analytically the electromagnetic pumping of non-Newtonian
   aqueous electrolytes via peristaltic waves in a two-dimensional
   microchannel with different peristaltic waves propagating at the upper
   and lower channel wall (complex wavy scenario). The Stokes couple stress
   model is deployed to capture micro-structural characteristics of real
   working fluids. The unsteady two-dimensional conservation equations for
   mass and momentum conservation, electro-kinetic and magnetic body
   forces, are formulated in two dimensional Cartesian co-ordinates. The
   transport equations are transformed from the wave frame to the
   laboratory frame and the electrical field terms rendered into electrical
   potential terms via the Poisson-Boltzmann equation, Debye length
   approximation and ionic Nernst Planck equation. The dimensionless
   emerging linearized electro-magnetic boundary value problem is solved
   using integral methods. The influence of Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity
   (characteristic electro-osmotic velocity), couple stress length
   parameter (measure of the polarity of the fluid), Hartmann magnetic
   number, and electro-osmotic parameter on axial velocity, volumetric flow
   rate, time-averaged flow rate and streamline distribution are visualized
   and interpreted at length. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Enhanced production of berberine in In vitro regenerated cell of
   Tinospora cordifolia and its analysis through LCMS QToF}},
Journal = {{3 BIOTECH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Tinospora cordifolia is a prioritized medicinal plant and having an
   immense medicinal importance especially in Indian medicinal system. But
   this plant needs a regeneration protocol for its rapid propagation. An
   efficient regeneration protocol was developed for T. cordifolia using
   nodal explants. High frequency of multiple shoot formation was induced
   when the nodal segments were cultured on MS medium supplemented with BAP
   (1.0 mg L-1) and 2- iP (0.5 mg L-1). The highest mean number of shoots
   per nodal explant (7.9 +/- 0.45) with highest shoot length (9.3 +/- 0.48
   cm) and 86\% response were achieved on this media and hormonal
   concentration. The optimum rooting was obtained on 1/2 strength of MS
   medium augmented with IBA (0.5 mg L-1) with 8.3 +/- 0.46 cm root length
   and 89\% response. Micropropagated plantlets were found to be identical
   with the mother plant when clonal fidelity of these plantlets were
   analyzed with inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) marker. The berberine
   content was analyzed through LCMS QToF and the highest amount was found
   in in vitro callus (19.8 mu g/gm) followed by stem (9.3 mu g/gm) and
   leaves of field-grown plants (8.4 mu g/gm). Further, presence of
   berberine was confirmed by ESI-MS spectra with protonated molecular ions
   ({[}M + H](+)) at m/z 336. Furthermore, MS-MS fragmentation pattern
   confirmed for the presence of berberine in both the samples. Both the
   spectra (standard and samples) showed common peaks for berberine in the
   form of protonated molecular ions ({[}M + H](+)) at m/z 320, m/z 304,
   m/z 292, m/z 278 in MS/MS mode. The study revealed that developed
   protocol is potent for rapid mass propagation of this plant species with
   high accumulation of important secondary metabolite berberine.}},

Title = {{Experimental investigation of impact of diesel particulate filter on
   smoke and NOx emissions of a Euro-I compression ignition engine with
   active and off-board regeneration}},
Journal = {{CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{19}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Old engines (Euro III or earlier) produce more emissions, and it will be
   difficult to entirely stop their usage especially in developing and
   under-developed nations; hence, it is desired that appropriate emission
   reduction technologies are tested on such engines to analyze their
   feasibility and economical acceptability. While most such studies have
   been conducted on constant speed stationary engines and modern engines,
   this study tried to analyze the effectiveness of an uncoated wall-flow
   type ceramic diesel particulate filter on a Euro-I, water-cooled, direct
   injection, variable speed, compression ignition engine in a laboratory
   set-up in India. Also, this study focused on diesel particulate filter
   regeneration by two methods: active regeneration by diesel injection in
   the particulate filter using an electronic control unit and off-board
   regeneration by taking out and heating the diesel particulate filter in
   an electrical resistance furnace at 650 A degrees C for 10 h. The
   results, in the form of smoke emission, NOx emission and engine
   performance, obtained using both the regeneration methods were analyzed,
   and conclusions were drawn. It was found that using diesel particulate
   filter, particulate matter emissions (smoke) were almost entirely
   eliminated. It was also found that off-board regeneration had numerous
   advantages compared to active regeneration. Since a furnace would be
   needed for off-board regeneration, an exchange process for diesel
   particulate filter is suggested.}},

Journal = {{THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES IN INFECTIOUS DISEASE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{4}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Telavancin (TD-6424), a semisynthetic lipoglycopeptide
   vancomycin-derivative, is a novel antimicrobial agent developed by
   Theravance for overcoming resistant Gram-positive bacterial infections,
   specifically methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The US
   Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) had approved telavancin in 2009 for
   the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSIs)
   caused by Gram-positive bacteria, including MRSA (S. aureus,
   Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus
   anginosus group, or Enterococcus faecalis). Telavancin has two proposed
   mechanisms of action. In vitro, telavancin has a rapid,
   concentration-dependent bactericidal effect, due to disruption of cell
   membrane integrity. Telavancin has demonstrable in vitro activity
   against aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria. Telavancin and
   vancomycin have similar spectra of activity. Gram-negative bacteria are
   usually non-susceptible to telavancin. Telavancin has been successfully
   tested in various animal models of bacteremia, endocarditis, meningitis,
   and pneumonia. Phase II Telavancin versus Standard Therapy for Treatment
   of Complicated Skin and Soft-Tissue Infections due to Gram-Positive
   Bacteria (FAST 1 and FAST 2) and phase III {[}Assessment of Telavancin
   in Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections 1 (ATLAS 1 and ATLAS
   2)] clinical trials have been conducted for evaluating telavancin's
   efficacy and safety in cSSSIs. Phase III clinical trials have been
   carried out for evaluating telavancin's safety and efficacy in
   nosocomial pneumonia {[}Assessment of Telavancin for Treatment of
   Hospital acquired Pneumonia 1 and 2 (ATTAIN 1 and ATTAIN 2)]. A phase II
   randomized, double-blind, clinical trial has been carried out for
   evaluating telavancin's safety and efficacy in uncomplicated S. aureus
   bacteremia {[}Telavancin for Treatment of Uncomplicated S. aureus
   Bacteremia (ASSURE)]. Pacemaker lead-related infective endocarditis due
   to a vancomycin intermediate S. aureus (VISA) strain (non-daptomycin
   susceptible) was successfully treated with parenteral telavancin for 8
   weeks. Telavancin extensively binds to serum albumin (similar to 93\%)
   and has a relatively small volume of distribution. Telavancin is not
   biotransformed by any cytochrome P450 microsomal enzymes and excreted
   mainly in the urine. Though well-tolerated, worrisome adverse effects,
   including renal dysfunction and QTc prolongation are of potential
   concern. Given its extensive binding to plasma proteins, long half-life,
   and a long post-antibiotic effect, it represents a promising addition to
   the therapeutic armamentarium in combating infections caused by
   resistant Gram-positive pathogens, namely, MRSA.}},

Journal = {{SOLID STATE COMMUNICATIONS}},

Volume = {{254}},
Pages = {{1-5}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In the present work, we report exchange bias tuning by varying thin film
   deposition parameters such as synthesis method and underlying layer
   patterning. The patterned substrates for this study were prepared by
   self-assembly of polystyrene (PS) latex spheres (-530 nm) on Si (100)
   substrate. The desired magnetic nanocaps composed of CoO/Co bilayer film
   on these patterned substrates were prepared by molecular beam epitaxy
   technique under ultra-high vacuum conditions. For this, a Co layer of-10
   nm thickness was deposited on the substrates and then oxidized in-situ
   to form CoO/Co/PS in-situ oxidized film or ex-situ in ambiance which
   also gives CoO/Co/PS naturally oxidized film. Simultaneously, reference
   thin films of Co (-10 rim) were also prepared on plane Si substrate and
   similar oxidation treatments were performed on them respectively. The
   magnetic properties studied using SQUID technique revealed higher
   exchange bias (1736 Oe) in the in-situ oxidized Co/PS film as compared
   to that in naturally oxidized Co/PS film (-1544 Oe) and also compared to
   the reference film. The observed variations in the magnetic properties
   are explained in terms of surface patterning induced structural changes
   of the deposited films and different oxidation methods.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, electronic structure and optical properties investigations
   for defect-chalcopyrite semiconductors ZnGa2Te4 and CdGa2Te4 are

   Energy bands and density of states (DOS) computations are performed
   using different flavors of exchange and correlations. The calculations
   are performed using Wu-Cohen generalized gradient approximation
   (WC-GGA), Perdew et al. (PBE-sol) and the most accurate modified Becke

   and DOS computed using mBJ potential are in better agreement with the
   available experimental data. Optical properties such as, dielectric
   tensor components, absorption spectra, reflectivity, refractivity,
   dielectric loss, are investigated using mBJ potential. Imaginary peaks
   of di-electric tensor epsilon(2)(omega), are interpreted by means of
   inter-band transitions from valence to conduction band. High intensity
   absorption curves from 3 to 5 eV, energy band gap depicted for ZnGa2Te4
   (1.61 eV) and CdGa2Te4 (1.78 eV) materials indicates their applicability

Pages = {{945-952}},
Abstract = {{In traditional verification environment, hardware and software involve
   isolated design and verification. Due to the demise of Moore's law, the
   processor's frequency is no longer increasing. This demise of Moore's
   law and time-to-market pressures drive the wave of new technology where
   hardware and software are tightly integrated. This is done in order to
   increase the speed of computation. Moreover, in domains like Data
   Analytics, data has to be processed in real time and that too at low
   latency. Solarflare's Application On-load Engine (AOE) represents a
   platform where an FPGA processing engine integrates with a low latency
   server for applications that require real time and low latency of data
   processing. This is where co-verification provides a solution for
   integration of hardware and software. Universal Verification Methodology
   (UVM) doesn't support co-verification and uses Direct Programming
   Interface (DPI) for co-simulation. Vlang, which is built on the top of
   D, a systems programming language, has complete implementation of UVM
   version 1.2. In co-verification, emulation of software is run along with
   the hardware verification where, software is emulated separately on

Abstract = {{An analytical investigation is presented to study the unsteady
   peristaltic transport of nanofluids. Three different geometries of
   nanoparticle viz bricks, cylinder and platelets are considered in our
   analysis. The flow geometry is taken as nonuniform channel of finite
   length to explore our model for wide range of biomedical applications.
   Exact solutions are obtained for the non-dimensional governing equations
   subject to physically realistic boundary conditions. The effects of
   nanoparticle shapes on effective thermal conductivity, axial velocity,
   transverse velocity, temperature, and pressure difference distributions
   along the length of non-uniform channel with variation of different flow
   parameters are discussed with the help of graphical illustrations. It is
   observed that platelet shaped nanoparticles carry maximum velocity
   whereas brick shaped nanoparticles are the best to enhance the thermal
   conductivity. An inherent property of peristaltic transport i.e.
   trapping is also discussed. This model is applicable in drugs delivery
   system where different geometries of drugs are delivered and it is also
   applicable to design a microperistaltic pump for transportation of
   nanofluids. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. This is an

Journal = {{ENGINEERING COMPUTATIONS}},

Volume = {{34}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this study is to analyze magnetohydrodynamic
   three-dimensional flow of Casson nanofluid over a stretching sheet in
   presence of thermophoresis and Brownian motion effects. In contrast, the
   convective surface boundary conditions with the effects of radiation are
   applied.
   Design/methodology/approach - The governing partial differential
   equations are transformed into highly nonlinear coupled ordinary
   differential equations consisting of the momentum, energy and
   nanoparticle concentration via suitable similarity transformations,
   which are then solved the using optimal homotopy analysis method (OHAM)
   a Mathematica Package BVPh2.0.
   Findings - The influence of emerging physical flow parameters on fluid
   velocity component, temperature distribution and nanoparticle
   concentration are discussed in detail. Also, an OHAMsolution
   demonstrates very good correlation with those obtained in the previously
   published results. It is noticed that OHAMcan overcome the earlier
   restriction, assumptions and limitation of traditional perturbation
   method. The main advantage of this method is that OHAM can be applied
   directly to nonlinear differential equations without using linearization
   and round-off errors, and therefore, it cannot be affected by error
   associated to discretization.
   Originality/value - Here the approximate solutions are compared with the
   numerical results published in earlier work.}},

Abstract = {{Analytical solutions are developed for the electro-kinetic flow of a
   viscoelastic biological liquid in a finite length cylindrical capillary
   geometry under peristaltic waves. The Jefferys' non-Newtonian
   constitutive model is employed to characterize rheological properties of
   the fluid. The unsteady conservation equations for mass and momentum
   with electro-kinetic and Darcian porous medium drag force terms are
   reduced to a system of steady linearized conservation equations in an
   axisymmetric coordinate system. The long wavelength, creeping (low
   Reynolds number) and Debye-Hiickel linearization approximations are
   utilized. The resulting boundary value problem is shown to be controlled
   by a number of parameters including the electro-osmotic parameter,
   Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity (maximum electro-osmotic velocity), and
   Jefferys' first parameter (ratio of relaxation and retardation time),
   wave amplitude. The influence of these parameters and also time on axial
   velocity, pressure difference, maximum volumetric flow rate and
   streamline distributions (for elucidating trapping phenomena) is
   visualized graphically and interpreted in detail. Pressure difference
   magnitudes are enhanced consistently with both increasing
   electro-osmotic parameter and Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity, whereas
   they are only elevated with increasing Jefferys' first parameter for
   positive volumetric flow rates. Maximum time averaged flow rate is
   enhanced with increasing electro-osmotic parameter,
   Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity and Jefferys' first parameter. Axial
   flow is accelerated in the core (plug) region of the conduit with
   greater values of electro-osmotic parameter and Helmholtz-Smoluchowski
   velocity whereas it is significantly decelerated with increasing
   Jefferys' first parameter. The simulftions find applications in
   electro-osmotic (E0) transport processes in capillary physiology and
   also bio-inspired EO pump devices in chemical and aerospace engineering.

Abstract = {{This paper describes the performance of thermal storage integrated
   micro-cogeneration system based on single cylinder diesel engine. In
   addition to electricity generated from genset, waste heat from hot
   exhaust of diesel engine was used to heat water in a double pipe heat
   exchanger of 67.70 cm length with inside tube diameter of 3.81 cm and
   outside tube diameter of 5.08 cm. Additionally, a latent heat thermal
   energy storage system was also integrated with this cogeneration system.
   A shell and tube type heat exchanger of 346 mm diameter and 420 mm
   height with 45 tubes of 18 mm diameter each was designed and fabricated,
   to store thermal energy, in which Erythritol (C4H10O4) was used as phase
   changing material. The test results show that micro capacity (4.4 kW),
   stationary, single cylinder, diesel engine can be successfully utilized
   to simultaneously produce power as well as heating, and to also store
   thermal energy. Slight decrease in engine performance was observed when
   double pipe heat exchanger and latent heat thermal energy storage system
   was integrated with engine but the amount of energy which could be
   recovered was significant. Maximum percentage of energy saved was
   obtained at a load of 3.6 kW and was 15.2\%. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All
