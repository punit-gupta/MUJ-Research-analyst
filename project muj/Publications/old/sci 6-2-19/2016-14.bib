Abstract = {{This paper aims to open a new vista of research in the direction of
   possible application of power electronics DC-DC converters in analog
   chaotic communication. Most of the work reported on analog chaotic
   communication is based on the pioneer work of Pecora and Caroll, with
   synchronization between transmitter and receiver. Receiver based on
   synchronization, also known as coherent receiver, has a disadvantage of
   parameter mismatch and is sensitive to noise. In the present work,
   firstly, a secure transmitter using chaotic DC-DC converters is proposed
   that encrypts information using chaotic switching map technique. In
   chaotic switching map technique, the message is encrypted by randomly
   switching from one chaotic converter to another. The bifurcation
   parameter of the randomly switched chaotic converter is modulated by the
   message. Secondly, an attempt has been made to design a robust
   non-coherent receiver that is adaptable to the switching chaotic
   transmitters, even in the presence of noise. Once the receiver
   identifies the chaotic converter, it can decode the message as per the
   decryption algorithm. With the proposed non-coherent receiver, the
   disadvantages of coherent receivers can be overcome. We have also
   devised a prototype smart meter, used in smart distribution grid for
   implementing the proposed communication technique. Copyright (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Background and objectives: With ongoing interest in CNT nanofluids and
   materials in biotechnology, energy and environment, microelectronics,
   composite materials etc., the current investigation is carried out to
   analyze the effects of variable viscosity and thermal conductivity of
   CNT nanofluids flow driven by cilia induced movement through a circular
   cylindrical tube. Metachronal wave is generated by the beating of cilia
   and mathematically modeled as elliptical wave propagation by Blake
   (1971).
   Methods, results and conclusions: The problem is formulated in the form
   of nonlinear partial differential equations, which are simplified by
   using the dimensional analysis to avoid the complicacy of dimensional
   homogeneity. Lubrication theory is employed to linearize the governing
   equations and it is also physically appropriate for cilia movement.
   Analytical solutions for velocity, temperature and pressure gradient and
   stream function are obtained. The analytical results are numerically
   simulated by using the Mathematica Software and plotted the graphs for
   velocity profile, temperature profile, pressure gradient and stream
   lines for better discussion and visualization. This model is applicable
   in physiological transport phenomena to explore the nanotechnology in
   engineering the artificial cilia and ciliated tube/pipe. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{We investigate the velocity slip and thermal slip effects on
   peristaltically driven thermal transport of nanofluids through the
   vertical parallel plates under the influence of transverse magnetic
   field. The wall surface is propagating with sinusoidal wave velocity c.
   The flow characteristics are governed by the mass, momentum and energy
   conservation principle. Low Reynolds number and large wavelength
   approximations are taken into consideration to simplify the non-linear
   terms. Analytical solutions for axial velocity, temperature field,
   pressure gradient and stream function are obtained under certain
   physical boundary conditions. Two types of nanoparticles, SiO2 and Ag,
   are considered for analysis with water as base fluid. This is the first
   article in the literature that discusses the SiO2 and Ag nanoparticles
   for a peristaltic flow with variable viscosity. The effects of physical
   parameters on velocity, temperature, pressure and trapping are
   discussed. A comparative study of SiO2 nanofluid, Ag nanofluid and pure
   water is also presented. This model is applicable in biomedical
   engineering to make thermal peristaltic pumps and other pumping devices
   like syringe pumps, etc. It is observed that pressure for pure water is
   maximum and pressure for Ag nanofluid is minimum.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing gap between demand and supply of energy has resulted in
   raised prices of conventional energy sources, and concern for clean
   environment has led to increase in use of renewable energy and focus on
   increased energy efficiency. In context of increased energy efficiency,
   energy storage and waste heat recovery play an important role as these
   systems improve overall efficiency of systems. In this study, a latent
   heat thermal energy storage system (LHTESS) for stationary C.I. engine
   exhaust heat was developed and integrated with engine. A shell and tube
   type heat exchanger having 346 mm diameter and 420 mm height with 45
   numbers of tubes with 18 mm diameter was developed to store thermal
   energy, in which Erythritol (C4H10O4) was used as a phase change
   material. The engine performance and the thermal energy storage system
   performance parameters such as amount of heat stored, and charging
   efficiency were evaluated. Slight decrease in the engine performance was
   observed when latent heat thermal energy storage system was integrated
   to engine but amount of energy which could be recovered was significant.
   At a load of 4.4 kW the maximum charging efficiency, recovery efficiency
   and percentage energy saved was 69.53\%, 38\% and 11.33\% respectively.

Abstract = {{The rapid increase in population of India forced people to migrate from
   rural areas and small towns to metropolitan cities for better
   employment, education, and, good lifestyle. Major cities of India were
   industrialized and required more work force in metropolitan cities,
   leading to uncoordinated and unplanned growth, often termed as urban
   sprawl. Urban sprawl destroyed the natural resources such as open green
   space, agricultural land, open water bodies and ground water. In this
   paper, an attempt has been made to monitor urban sprawl using Shannon's
   Entropy model, Remote Sensing, and GIS for city Jaipur, India. The
   changed entropy value during the years 1972-2013 proves more dispersed
   growth in the city. The built-up area of Jaipur has increased from 40
   km2 in 1972 to 400 km2 in 2013. Land use percentage of urban settlement
   is doubled as compared to the urban population of Jaipur during
   1972-2013. This study shows remarkable urban sprawl in fringe areas of

Abstract = {{Background: Eco-friendly synthesis of nanoparticles is viewed as an
   alternative to the chemical method and initiated the use of
   microorganisms for synthesis. The present study has been designed to
   utilize plant pathogenic fungi Sclerotinia sclerotiorum MTCC 8785 strain
   for synthesis and optimization of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs)
   production as well as evaluation of antibacterial properties. The AgNPs
   were synthesized by reduction of aqueous silver nitrate (AgNO3) solution
   after incubation of 3-5 days at room temperature. The AgNPs were further
   characterized using UV-visible spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy (FTIR) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Reaction
   parameters including media, fungal biomass, AgNO3 concentration, pH and
   temperature were further optimized for rapid AgNPs production. The
   antibacterial efficacy of AgNPs was evaluated against Escherichia coli
   ATCC 25922 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 by disc diffusion and
   growth kinetics assay at the concentration determined by the minimum
   inhibitory concentration (MIC).
   Results: AgNPs synthesis was initially marked by the change in colour
   from pale white to brown and was confirmed by UV-Vis spectroscopy.
   Optimization studies showed that potato dextrose broth (PDB) media, 10 g
   of biomass, addition of 2 mM AgNO3, pH 11 and 80 degrees C temperature
   resulted in enhanced AgNPs synthesis through extracellular route. TEM
   data revealed spherical shape AgNPs with size in the range of 10 nm.
   Presence of proteins capped to AgNPs was confirmed by FTIR. AgNPs showed
   antibacterial activity against E. coli and S. aureus at 100 ppm
   concentration, corresponding MIC value.
   Conclusion: S. sclerotiorum MTCC 8785 mediated AgNPs was synthesized
   rapidly under optimized conditions, which showed antibacterial activity.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a laboratory-based penning plasma discharge source is
   reported which has been developed in two anode configurations and is
   able to produce visible and VUV lights simultaneously. The developed
   source has simultaneous diagnostics facility using Langmuir probe and
   optical emission spectroscopy. The two anode configurations, namely,
   double ring and rectangular configurations, have been studied and
   compared for optimum use of the geometry for efficient light emissions
   and recording. The plasma is produced using helium gas and admixture of
   three noble gases including helium, neon, and argon. The source is
   capable to produce eight spectral lines for pure helium in the VUV range
   from 20 to 60 nm and total 24 spectral lines covering the wavelength
   range 20-106 nm for the admixture of gases. The large range of VUV lines
   is generated from gaseous admixture rather from the sputtered materials.
   The recorded spectrum shows that the plasma light radiations in both
   visible and VUV range are larger in double ring configuration than that
   of the rectangular configurations at the same discharge operating
   conditions. To clearly understand the difference, the imaging of the
   discharge using ICCD camera and particle-in-cell simulation using VORPAL
   have also been carried out. The effect of ion diffusion, metastable
   collision with the anode wall and the nonlinear effects are correlated
   to explain the results.}},

Abstract = {{A design of two-dimensional hybrid photonic crystal fiber (PCF) with
   elliptical and circular air holes and its analyses for large flattened
   dispersion and high birefringence is presented. The PCF has hexagonal
   layout with triangular lattice. There are five rings around the solid
   core. The inner three rings around the core have elliptical air holes
   while the outer two rings have circular air holes. Three such layouts
   are designed, analyzed, and compared with the layout having only
   circular air hole using full-vector finite difference time domain
   method. The layout with hybrid structure having combined elliptical and
   circular air hole gives a large flattened dispersion of the order of
   4.88 ps/nm/km for the wavelength range of 1.2 to 1.8 mu m and magnitude
   of modal birefringence is 1.238 x 10(-3) at 1.55-mu m wavelength. (C)

Abstract = {{The present study describes surface modification of leather using
   environment friendly atmospheric pressure dielectric barrier discharge
   (DBD) process to improve dyeing with natural dyes. Leather samples were
   exposed to dielectric barrier discharge produced in air. DBD plasma
   treatment changes morphology and chemical composition of the surface of
   leather samples. The chemical changes at leather surface are confirmed
   by Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. The morphology and chemical
   composition of leather surface is studied using scanning electron
   microscope and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. We observed significant
   improvement in dye uptake properties after air plasma treatment.
   Different species formed in plasma are identified using optical emission
   spectroscopy. Untreated and plasma treated samples were dyed with
   Eco-Garnet Brown, Eco-Hill Brown III, Eco-Turkey Red and Eco-Smoke Grey
   natural dyes. Dyeing behavior was assessed by spectroscopic measurement
   and by measuring fastness (wash and rub) properties. This has clearly
   indicated an increase in color intensity of plasma exposed leather as
   well as an increase in the dye uptake as compared to the untreated
   leather. Best results were obtained with Eco-Hill Brown III and
   Eco-Smoke Grey dyes. The study reveals that atmospheric pressure plasma
   has potential to become dry and eco-friendly process to modify leather
   surface to improve dye uptake properties with natural dyes.}},

Abstract = {{The screen adaptation of the novella Devdas by Saratchandra
   Chattopadhyay is an important landmark in early Indian cinema. A
   prominent film, screened in four Indian languages (Bengali, Hindi,
   Telugu and Tamil), it seems to offer a novel vision of romantic love and
   romanticism. This article critiques the fanciful interpretations of the
   film provided by some postmodern academics in the field of comparative
   literature. It endeavours to place the film both as text and cinematic
   work into a broader perspective based on the study of intertextuality of
   three renditions: Raghavaiah's Devdas (Telugu, 1953), Bimal Roy's Devdas
   (Hindi, 1955) and Bhansali's Devdas (Hindi, 2002). Grounded in cultural
   theory and Indian performative aesthetics coupled with moving image
   analysis, this study highlights the underlying, deep-rooted romanticism
   embedded in Indian philosophical and aesthetic traditions of devotion
   between atma (individual soul) and paramatma (absolute soul),
   personifying Paro/Chandramukhi as atma and Devdas as paramatma. This
   article, part of a larger project on de-Westernising media studies,
   makes a critical intervention in current South Asian Studies by aiming
   to provide a novel theoretical framework to which the philosophical and
   traditional tenets grounding the novella of Devdas can be anchored.}},

   all repair activities. After a pre-specified time to enhance the
   performance and efficiency of the system the unit goes for preventive
   maintenance (PM). Priority to the repair of original unit is given over
   the PM of duplicate unit. Numerical results for the mean time of system
   failure, availability and profit function have been derived for a

Abstract = {{The present study investigates the radiation effects in flow through
   porous medium over a permeable rotating disk with velocity slip and
   temperature jump. Fluid properties density (rho), viscosity (mu), and
   thermal conductivity (kappa) are taken to be dependent on temperature.
   Particular case considering these fluid properties' constant is also
   discussed. The governing partial differential equations are converted
   into nonlinear normal differential equation using similarity
   alterations. Transformed system of equations is solved numerically by
   using Runge-Kutta method with shooting technique. Effects of various
   parameters such as porosity parameter K, suction parameter W-s,
   rotational Reynolds number Re, Knudsen number Kn, Prandtl number Pr,
   radiation parameter N, and relative temperature difference parameter
   epsilon on velocity profiles along radial, tangential, and axial
   direction and temperature distribution are investigated for both
   variable fluid properties and constant fluid properties. Results

Abstract = {{Due to its large scale applications in the real field, the study of
   bi-metallic nano-alloy clusters is an active field of research. Though a
   number of experimental reports are available in this domain, a deep
   theoretical insight is yet to receive. Among several nano-clusters, the
   compound formed between Cu-Ag has gained a large importance due to its
   remarkable optical property. Density Functional Theory (DFT) is one of
   the most popular approaches of quantum mechanics to study the electronic
   properties of materials. Conceptually, DFT based descriptors have turned
   to be indispensable tools for analyzing and correlating the experimental
   properties of compounds. In this venture, we have analyzed the
   experimental properties of the (Cu-Ag)(n) (= 1 - 7) nano-alloy clusters
   invoking DFT methodology. A nice correlation has been found between
   optical properties of the aforesaid nano-clusters with our evaluated
   theoretical descriptors. The similar agreement between experimental bond
   length and computed data is also reflected in this analysis. Beside
   these, the effect of even-odd alternation behavior of nano compounds on
   the HOMO-LUMO gap is very important in our computation. It is probably
   the first attempt to establish such type of correlation.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study is to closely examine the evidence of
   decoupling of economic growth from environmental degradation as
   experienced by OECD member countries. In order to analyze these aspects

   outlined in the OECD report, which state that Indicators measure the
   decoupling of environmental pressure from economic growth for analyzing
   environmental pressure/degradation indicators, such as population
   growth, energy production, greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, CO2 emission,
   SOx emission, NOx emission, water abstraction and waste with economic
   indicator, i.e., nominal and per capita GDP. The major finding of this
   study is that among the selected indicators, some resulted from relative
   decoupling rather than absolute decoupling, which means that the
   environmental pressure still increases, albeit at a lower rate than
   economic performance, and that the presence of decoupling is not an
   indication for sustainable economic development.}},

Journal = {{CASE STUDIES ON TRANSPORT POLICY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{295-303}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Structuring public private partnerships (PPP) in railways is a
   challenge, given its technology base, and obligation as a public and
   affordable mode of transportation. The sector provides strong incentives
   for vertical integration due to economies of scope. However, it is
   evident from the literature that large integrated PPPs in railway
   systems are not feasible due to higher commercial risks. They also
   suffer from implicit cross subsidization since the railway
   infrastructure is capital intensive, common to multiple revenue sources,
   and fare box revenues are generally not sufficient to recover
   investments. This is being addressed by various unbundling approaches in
   recent PPPs. The common unbundling is between infrastructure,
   operations, and services.
   The objective of this research is to explore the potential of unbundling
   further and to come up with a framework that helps policy makers in
   taking macro level decisions on PPP structuring. The research
   disaggregates the railway system into over 40 `elements' wherein an
   element is the smallest unit that can be given to a party for execution.
   However this unbundling would result in significant horizontal and
   vertical interfaces between these elements.
   A sustainable PPP would need to limit the extent of interfaces due to
   transaction costs and risks. This can be achieved by bundling the
   elements horizontally and/or vertically into `entities' to extract the
   best value for a PPP. The governing principles would be scale economies
   (horizontal integration), scope economies (vertical integration), need
   for competition (horizontal disaggregation), level playing field,
   transactional transparency, and need for specialization (vertical
   disaggregation). Additional drivers would be appetite for investment,
   availability of competence and accountability for an entity. The
   findings of the research indicate that the entity formation is one of
   the most crucial aspects of a PPP in railways.
   A consequential critical area is managing the interfaces between
   entities, which are subject to transaction costs and risks. These should
   be carefully identified and addressed by well-designed contractual
   agreements and independent regulation. (C) 2014 World Conference on

Abstract = {{Spin-polarized Compton profiles of TbCo2 have been measured to elucidate
   the interesting behavior of spin and orbital moments at different
   temperatures. The magnetic Compton profiles (MCPs) have been analyzed in
   terms of site specific spin moments due to Tb-4f electrons, Co and
   itinerant electrons. The temperature dependence of the orbital moment
   has been deduced using Compton and magnetometry data ranging between 6
   and 300 K. The present data exhibit a decrease in the ratio of orbital
   to spin moments from 43.9\% to 35.0\% (while going from 6 to 300 K).
   First-principles calculations within DFT + U scheme have also been
   performed to confirm the spin-, orbital-and site specific-magnetic
   moments in TbCo2. An antiparallel exchange coupling between the Tb-4f
   and Co spin moments is found. The orbital moment is found to have a
   parallel coupling with the Tb spin moment, as evident from the
   experimental MCPs. From first-principles data it is seen that the
   orbital moments of Tb and Co sites are antiparallel to each other, as in
   the case of their spin magnetic moments. The present experimental study
   also shows an existence of an itinerant moment which is coupled
   ferromagnetically with the Tb-4f spin moment. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The present research protocol was developed to locate endophytic fungi
   present inside the healthy leaves of Tinospora cord ifolia. The surface
   sterilized leaf explants after staining with lactophenol cotton blue
   showed the presence of endophytic fungi in intercellular spaces of
   ground, dermal tissue especially in midrib region. Leaves have shown
   dense colonies of endophytic fungi. Microscopic examination of in vitro
   and in vivo leaves has shown mycelium which was dense, branched and
   septate. Hence, the comparative study was conducted in both in vitro and
   in vivo leaves of T. cord ifolia to locate endophytic fungi. The present
   study revealed that the fungi are not only developed in plants under
   natural environment but also under controlled conditions i.e. tissue
   culture of plants. Therefore, the present research work favoured the
   view that endophytes can infect nutrient medium of in vitro culture of
   T. cord ifolia and diversity of endophytic fungi increase after
   hardening and acclimatization of T. cord ifolia plantlets. The presence
   of endophytes in in vitro cultures depends both on age of tissue and
   host genotype. Further studies are required to isolate the endophytic
   fungi, pure culture on PDA plates and their identification to explore
   their biosynthetic pathway. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the present work an effort has been made to estimate the plasma
   parameters simultaneously like-electron density, electron temperature,
   ground state atom density, ground state ion density and metastable state
   density from the observed visible spectra of penning plasma discharge
   (PPD) source using least square fitting. The analysis is performed for
   the prominently observed neutral helium lines. The atomic data and
   analysis structure (ADAS) database is used to provide the required
   collisional-radiative (CR) photon emissivity coefficients (PECs) values
   under the optical thin plasma condition in the analysis. With this
   condition the estimated plasma temperature from the PPD is found rather
   high. It is seen that the inclusion of opacity in the observed spectral
   lines through PECs and addition of diffusion of neutrals and metastable
   state species in the CR-model code analysis improves the electron
   temperature estimation in the simultaneous measurement.}},

   considerable change of the optical properties of the dye rhodamine 6G
   (R6G) in PS has been achieved. For all states of preparation of the
   sample, PL, UV/vis transmission spectroscopy and electrical measurements
   were carried out. From our transmission and electrical measurements we
   concluded that the quenching of PL is attributed to a fundamental
   disruption of the luminescence mechanism. A blue shift in the PL peak of
   R6G in PS compared to bulk R6G is attributed to an efficient quantum

   Functional theory (DFT). It is seen that the generalized gradient

   than other DFT based approximations, validating the GGA approximation
   for rare-earth sesquioxides. The energy bands and density of states
   computed using LCAO calculations show its wide band gap nature which is

Abstract = {{Nanoporous gold (npg) produced by dealloying of Au alloys has been
   recently proposed for many different applications from catalysis to
   bio-sensors. Furthermore, Au alloys constitute an important model system
   in the context of corrosion, dealloying, and stress corrosion cracking.
   Adsorbed self-assembled monolayers of thiol molecules inhibit the
   dealloying reaction. On thiol-modified Cu-Au alloys dealloying finally
   proceeds in a localized reaction instead of a homogeneous process. Using
   ethanethiols as an example, we show here that thiols can be effectively
   removed by application of anodic oxidation. Homogeneous porosity forms
   then after an oxidation step. In-situ X-ray diffraction and crystal
   truncation rod analysis of ethanethiol-modified Au (001) confirms that a
   bare Au surface is recovered after a similar oxidation step. In
   consequence, a multi-step dealloying process including complete initial
   thiol-layers as well as partially or fully re-cleaned surfaces can
   produce different micro-cracks, providing larger scale openings, and
   homogeneous nanoporous Au in between. Such hierarchically structured
   surfaces may show superior applicability for reactions where mass
   transport into the porous layer plays a decisive role for the reaction
   rate or detection probability. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The effect of atmospheric pressure ammonia dielectric bather discharge
   on the surface of polyester fabric has been studied using contact angle
   goniometer, ATR-FTIR spectroscopy and SEM. It is observed that the
   surface of plasma treated polyester is more hydrophilic due to
   incorporation of nitrogenous polar functional groups and shows different
   conformational composition and crystallinity. The ATR-FTIR results
   clearly indicate the conversion of trans ethylene glycol residue to
   gauche one after plasma treatment and thus reduction in crystallinity.
   Plasma treatment has shown synergetic effect on dye uptake. Natural
   dyeing of plasma treated polyester with `Rubia cordifolia' has shown
   65\% improvement in colour depth in comparison to untreated polyester
   fabric.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, the use of mobile agents in wireless sensor networks (WSNs)
   has emerged as the topic of extensive research due to their efficient
   utilization of network bandwidth and energy, and flexibility of their
   use for different WSN applications. Most of the proposed mobile agent
   based schemes use static itineraries for agents' migration that are
   computed at the sink using a centralized algorithm. These centralized
   algorithms require global knowledge of sensor distribution, which is
   difficult to obtain accurately. Other issue with static itinerary based
   agent migration is that an agent may not move along its itinerary due to
   node failures or malicious node attacks. In order to solve these issues,
   we first propose a framework for trust evaluation to identify the
   malicious behavior of sensor nodes and then give a localized distributed
   protocol, called energy and trust aware mobile agent migration (ETMAM)
   protocol for periodic data gathering application. The results of our
   simulation study show that the ETMAM protocol is effective in improving
   resilience against node failures or malicious nodes attacks. (c) 2014
