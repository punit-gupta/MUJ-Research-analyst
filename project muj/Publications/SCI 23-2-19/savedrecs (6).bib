Title = {{Enhanced production of berberine in In vitro regenerated cell of
   Tinospora cordifolia and its analysis through LCMS QToF}},
Journal = {{3 BIOTECH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{APR 11}},
Abstract = {{Tinospora cordifolia is a prioritized medicinal plant and having an
   immense medicinal importance especially in Indian medicinal system. But
   this plant needs a regeneration protocol for its rapid propagation. An
   efficient regeneration protocol was developed for T. cordifolia using
   nodal explants. High frequency of multiple shoot formation was induced
   when the nodal segments were cultured on MS medium supplemented with BAP
   (1.0 mg L-1) and 2- iP (0.5 mg L-1). The highest mean number of shoots
   per nodal explant (7.9 +/- 0.45) with highest shoot length (9.3 +/- 0.48
   cm) and 86\% response were achieved on this media and hormonal
   concentration. The optimum rooting was obtained on 1/2 strength of MS
   medium augmented with IBA (0.5 mg L-1) with 8.3 +/- 0.46 cm root length
   and 89\% response. Micropropagated plantlets were found to be identical
   with the mother plant when clonal fidelity of these plantlets were
   analyzed with inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) marker. The berberine
   content was analyzed through LCMS QToF and the highest amount was found
   in in vitro callus (19.8 mu g/gm) followed by stem (9.3 mu g/gm) and
   leaves of field-grown plants (8.4 mu g/gm). Further, presence of
   berberine was confirmed by ESI-MS spectra with protonated molecular ions
   ({[}M + H](+)) at m/z 336. Furthermore, MS-MS fragmentation pattern
   confirmed for the presence of berberine in both the samples. Both the
   spectra (standard and samples) showed common peaks for berberine in the
   form of protonated molecular ions ({[}M + H](+)) at m/z 320, m/z 304,
   m/z 292, m/z 278 in MS/MS mode. The study revealed that developed
   protocol is potent for rapid mass propagation of this plant species with
   high accumulation of important secondary metabolite berberine.}},

Abstract = {{A low voltage self-biased high swing cascode current mirror (SHCCM) with
   improved bandwidth has been proposed. The recently reported SHCCM
   architecture use the bulk-driven quasi-floating gate (BDQFG) MOS
   transistors to enhance the effective transconductance which improves the
   current mirror input resistance and bandwidth range over the same
   architecture realized using bulk-driven MOS transistors. To further
   improve the bandwidth the proposed BDQFG based SHCCM uses two
   resistances which makes the current mirror frequency response free from
   input capacitors and also reduces the parasitic capacitance effect which
   results in increased bandwidth with an advantage of having no
   degradation in other performance parameters of current mirror. The
   proposed current mirror operates well for input current range from 0 to
   200 mu A with good linearity and shows the bandwidth of 298 MHz (i.e.,
   1.6 times over prior reported BDQFG based SHCCM). The observed input and
   output resistance is 306 Omega and 165 k Omega, respectively. Further,
   the THD analysis is carried to prove the robustness of proposed current
   mirror. The complete analysis is performed on UMC 0.18 mu m technology
   using HSpice.}},

Abstract = {{Old engines (Euro III or earlier) produce more emissions, and it will be
   difficult to entirely stop their usage especially in developing and
   under-developed nations; hence, it is desired that appropriate emission
   reduction technologies are tested on such engines to analyze their
   feasibility and economical acceptability. While most such studies have
   been conducted on constant speed stationary engines and modern engines,
   this study tried to analyze the effectiveness of an uncoated wall-flow
   type ceramic diesel particulate filter on a Euro-I, water-cooled, direct
   injection, variable speed, compression ignition engine in a laboratory
   set-up in India. Also, this study focused on diesel particulate filter
   regeneration by two methods: active regeneration by diesel injection in
   the particulate filter using an electronic control unit and off-board
   regeneration by taking out and heating the diesel particulate filter in
   an electrical resistance furnace at 650 A degrees C for 10 h. The
   results, in the form of smoke emission, NOx emission and engine
   performance, obtained using both the regeneration methods were analyzed,
   and conclusions were drawn. It was found that using diesel particulate
   filter, particulate matter emissions (smoke) were almost entirely
   eliminated. It was also found that off-board regeneration had numerous
   advantages compared to active regeneration. Since a furnace would be
   needed for off-board regeneration, an exchange process for diesel
   particulate filter is suggested.}},

Journal = {{EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{132}},

Month = {{MAR 2}},
Abstract = {{The transport of single-wall carbon nanotube (CNT) nanofluids with
   temperature-dependent variable viscosity is analyzed by peristaltically
   driven flow. The main flow problem has been modeled using cylindrical
   coordinates and flow equations are simplified to ordinary differential
   equations using long wavelength and low Reynolds' number approximation.
   Analytical solutions have been obtained for axial velocity, pressure
   gradient and temperature. Results acquired are discussed graphically for
   better understanding. It is observed that with an increment in the
   Grashof number the velocity of the governing fluids starts to decrease
   significantly and the pressure gradient is higher for pure water as
   compared to single-walled carbon nanotubes due to low density. As the
   specific heat is very high for pure water as compared to the multi-wall
   carbon nanotubes, it raises temperature of the muscles, in the case of
   pure water, as compared to the multi-walled carbon nanotubes.
   Furthermore, it is noticed that the trapped bolus starts decreasing in
   size as the buoyancy forces are dominant as compared to viscous forces.
   This model may be applicable in biomedical engineering and
   nanotechnology to design the biomedical devices.}},

Abstract = {{As the amount of assets invested in mutual funds has ballooned, mutual
   funds have become more abundant and more attractive to investors. The
   initial goal of mutual funds was to make saving and diversification more
   seamless for the lay investor, but as more and more mutual funds were
   developed and as more investment companies marketed their mutual funds,
   it became very difficult and confusing for investors to select mutual
   funds. Moreover, as the popularity of these mutual funds increased,
   evidenced by the sheer amount and growth of invested assets from 1999 to
   2010, finance practitioners and researchers scholars started examining
   the attributes of mutual funds that affected sales of mutual funds. The
   purpose of the study is to determine whether mutual fund attributes
   affect mutual fund performance. In the present study attributes like
   Brandname and Asset under Management (AUM) is studied and how these
   attributes affect the investment in Mutual fund by retail investors is
   examined. This is an empirical study, where responses from investors are
   collected with the help of questionnaire and cross tab function in SPSS
   used to analyse the relationship between Brandname and Sales and AUM and
   Sales. It can be concluded from the analysis that both investors
   consider both Brand name and AUM of mutual fund before making investment

   vancomycin-derivative, is a novel antimicrobial agent developed by
   Theravance for overcoming resistant Gram-positive bacterial infections,
   specifically methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The US
   Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) had approved telavancin in 2009 for
   the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSIs)
   caused by Gram-positive bacteria, including MRSA (S. aureus,
   Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus
   anginosus group, or Enterococcus faecalis). Telavancin has two proposed
   mechanisms of action. In vitro, telavancin has a rapid,
   concentration-dependent bactericidal effect, due to disruption of cell
   membrane integrity. Telavancin has demonstrable in vitro activity
   against aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria. Telavancin and
   vancomycin have similar spectra of activity. Gram-negative bacteria are
   usually non-susceptible to telavancin. Telavancin has been successfully
   tested in various animal models of bacteremia, endocarditis, meningitis,

   susceptible) was successfully treated with parenteral telavancin for 8
   weeks. Telavancin extensively binds to serum albumin (similar to 93\%)
   and has a relatively small volume of distribution. Telavancin is not
   biotransformed by any cytochrome P450 microsomal enzymes and excreted
   mainly in the urine. Though well-tolerated, worrisome adverse effects,
   including renal dysfunction and QTc prolongation are of potential
   concern. Given its extensive binding to plasma proteins, long half-life,
   and a long post-antibiotic effect, it represents a promising addition to
   the therapeutic armamentarium in combating infections caused by
   resistant Gram-positive pathogens, namely, MRSA.}},

Abstract = {{A mathematical model to simulate oxygen delivery through a capillary to
   tissues under the influence of an external force field is presented. The
   multi-term general fractional diffusion equation containing force terms
   and a time dependent absorbent term is taken into account. Fractional
   calculus is applied to describe the phenomenon of sub-diffusion of
   oxygen in both transverse and longitudinal directions. A new
   computational algorithm, i.e., the new iterative method (NIM) is
   employed to solve the spatio-temporal fractional partial differential
   equation subject to appropriate physical boundary conditions. Validation
   of NIM solutions is achieved with a modified adomian decomposition
   method (MADM). A parametric study is conducted for three loading
   scenarios on the capillary-radial force alone, axial force alone and the
   combined case of both forces. The results demonstrate that the force
   terms markedly influence the oxygen diffusion process. For example, the
   radial force exerts a more profound effect than axial force on
   sub-diffusion of oxygen indicating that careful manipulation of these
   forces on capillarytissues may assist in the effective reduction of
   hypoxia or other oxygen depletion phenomena.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The present investigation focusses on a mathematical study of creeping
   viscous flow induced by metachronal wave propagation in a horizontal
   ciliated tube containing porous media. Creeping flow limitations are
   imposed, i. e. inertial forces are small compared to viscous forces and
   therefore a very low Reynolds number ( Re << 1) is taken into account.
   The wavelength of metachronal wave is also considered to be very large
   for cilia movement. The physical problem is linearized and exact
   solutions are developed for the differential equation problem.
   Mathematica software is used to compute and illustrate numerical
   results. The influence of slip parameter and Darcy number on velocity
   profile, pressure gradient and trapping of bolus are discussed with the
   aid of graphs. It is found that with increasing magnitude of the slip
   parameter, the trapped bolus inside the streamlines increases in size.
   The study is relevant to biological propulsion of medical micromachines

Volume = {{254}},
Pages = {{1-5}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In the present work, we report exchange bias tuning by varying thin film
   deposition parameters such as synthesis method and underlying layer
   patterning. The patterned substrates for this study were prepared by
   self-assembly of polystyrene (PS) latex spheres (-530 nm) on Si (100)
   substrate. The desired magnetic nanocaps composed of CoO/Co bilayer film
   on these patterned substrates were prepared by molecular beam epitaxy
   technique under ultra-high vacuum conditions. For this, a Co layer of-10
   nm thickness was deposited on the substrates and then oxidized in-situ
   to form CoO/Co/PS in-situ oxidized film or ex-situ in ambiance which
   also gives CoO/Co/PS naturally oxidized film. Simultaneously, reference
   thin films of Co (-10 rim) were also prepared on plane Si substrate and
   similar oxidation treatments were performed on them respectively. The
   magnetic properties studied using SQUID technique revealed higher
   exchange bias (1736 Oe) in the in-situ oxidized Co/PS film as compared
   to that in naturally oxidized Co/PS film (-1544 Oe) and also compared to
   the reference film. The observed variations in the magnetic properties
   are explained in terms of surface patterning induced structural changes
   of the deposited films and different oxidation methods.}},

Journal = {{IET GENERATION TRANSMISSION \& DISTRIBUTION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{3, SI}},

Month = {{FEB 16}},
Abstract = {{The integration of Distributed Generation (DG) units in the existing
   power system has made the reliable operation of the system more complex.
   This has necessitated a comprehensive approach in planning the expansion
   of the system with the incorporation of DG units for effective and
   reliable operation of the system. In this study, a robust Hybrid
   Islanding Detection Technique (HIDT) has been proposed for identifying
   the islanding event early and accurately in the distribution networks
   with DGs installed by a two-step Genetic Algorithm (GA) process. As the
   reliability of power supply to the customer is of utmost importance, a
   priority-based load shedding scheme is proposed. The proposed load
   shedding scheme sheds only the vulnerable loads in the island for
   regaining the frequency and voltage stabilities. By the proposed
   methods, a comprehensive solution for system planning and emergency
   control actions can be obtained for effective operation of the system
   with DG units. The proposed methods are investigated on standard IEEE 33
   and 69 bus distribution systems under different loading conditions. The
   results obtained show that the proposed methods are able to identify the
   islanding event more effectively and also regain the stability in the
   island with less amount of load shedding.}},

Abstract = {{paper presents an analytical study of magnetohydrodynamics and
   convective heat transfer of nanofluids synthesized by three different
   shaped (brick, platelet and cylinder) silver (Ag) nanoparticles in
   water. A two-phase nanoscale formulation is adopted which is more
   appropriate for biophysical systems. The flow is induced by metachronal
   beating of cilia and the flow geometry is considered as a cylindrical
   tube. The analysis is carried out under the low Reynolds number and long
   wavelength approximations and the fluid and cilia dynamics is of the
   creeping type. A Lorentzian magnetic body force model is employed and
   magnetic induction effects are neglected. Solutions to the transformed
   boundary value problem are obtained via numerical integration. The
   influence of cilia length parameter, Hartmann (magnetic) number, heat
   absorption parameter, Grashof number (free convection), solid
   nanoparticle volume fraction, and cilia eccentricity parameter on the
   flow and heat transfer characteristics (including effective thermal
   conductivity of the nanofluid) are examined in detail. Furthermore a
   comparative study for different nanoparticle geometries (i.e. bricks,
   platelets and cylinders) is conducted. The computations show that
   pressure increases with enhancing the heat absorption, buoyancy force
   (i.e. Grashof number) and nanoparticle fraction however it reduces with
   increasing the magnetic field. The computations also reveal that
   pressure enhancement is a maximum for the platelet nano-particle case
   compared with the brick and cylinder nanoparticle cases. Furthermore the
   quantity of trapped streamlines for cylinder type nanoparticles exceeds
   substantially that computed for brick and platelet nanoparticles,
   whereas the bolus magnitude (trapped zone) for brick nanoparticles is
   demonstrably greater than that obtained for cylinder and platelet
   nanoparticles. The present model is applicable in biological and
   biomimetic transport phenomena exploiting magnetic nanofluids and
   ciliated inner tube surfaces. (C) 2016 The Society of Powder Technology

Abstract = {{This paper presents and examines the interreligious
   philosopher-theologian Raimon Panikkar's proposal of `Cosmic Confidence'
   in interreligious spirituality and another dialogue theologian Paul
   Knitter's critique on it. Their conversation is to be situated in a
   wider issue of the relation between pluralism and justice. The paper
   proceeds in three parts. The first part summarily presents the context
   and direction of Panikkar's pluralistic vision, particularly with a
   focus on his central insight of cosmic confidence. The second part
   indicates a challenge to Panikkar's cosmic confidence in terms of a
   preferential option for the poor - a spirit, of course, of liberation
   theology, but also that gets reflected in the challenge thrown by
   Knitter. And the final part deals with some implications of their mutual
   dialogue for the issue of pluralism, justice and reconciliation.}},

   evaluated for six different DG operational modes and compared with
   results obtained in the base case. By investigation of obtained

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel approach in addressing a critical power
   system issue, i.e., automatic generation control (AGC) in a smart grid
   scenario. It proposes the design and implementation of an optimized
   fuzzy logic controller (FLC) for AGC of interconnected power network.
   There are three different sources of power generation considered in the
   two-area interconnected model of power system network. First area is
   equipped with a single reheat thermal unit and a superconducting
   magnetic energy storage (SMES) unit, while another area has a hydro-unit
   with SMES. A multi-stage optimization strategy for the optimal solution
   of FLC for tie-line and frequency oscillation suppression is proposed in
   this paper using an ant colony optimization technique. The optimization
   of FLC is carried out in four different stages. The first stage is the
   optimization of range of input and output variables; the second stage is
   the optimization of membership function; the third and fourth stages are
   the optimization for rule base and rule weight optimization,
   respectively. The performance of the proposed controller is also
   compared with another control approaches to stabilize Ptie-line and
   Lambda f oscillations; these are the Ziegler-Nichols-tuned
   proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller and genetic algorithm
   optimized PID controller. A comprehensive analysis of the traditional
   techniques and proposed techniques is presented on the basis of major
   dynamic performance parameters, i.e., settling time and peak overshoot.}},

Abstract = {{In traditional verification environment, hardware and software involve
   isolated design and verification. Due to the demise of Moore's law, the
   processor's frequency is no longer increasing. This demise of Moore's
   law and time-to-market pressures drive the wave of new technology where
   hardware and software are tightly integrated. This is done in order to
   increase the speed of computation. Moreover, in domains like Data
   Analytics, data has to be processed in real time and that too at low
   latency. Solarflare's Application On-load Engine (AOE) represents a
   platform where an FPGA processing engine integrates with a low latency
   server for applications that require real time and low latency of data
   processing. This is where co-verification provides a solution for
   integration of hardware and software. Universal Verification Methodology
   (UVM) doesn't support co-verification and uses Direct Programming
   Interface (DPI) for co-simulation. Vlang, which is built on the top of
   D, a systems programming language, has complete implementation of UVM
   version 1.2. In co-verification, emulation of software is run along with
   the hardware verification where, software is emulated separately on

Journal = {{RESULTS IN PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2017}},

Pages = {{2477-2484}},
Abstract = {{An analytical investigation is presented to study the unsteady
   peristaltic transport of nanofluids. Three different geometries of
   nanoparticle viz bricks, cylinder and platelets are considered in our
   analysis. The flow geometry is taken as nonuniform channel of finite
   length to explore our model for wide range of biomedical applications.
   Exact solutions are obtained for the non-dimensional governing equations
   subject to physically realistic boundary conditions. The effects of
   nanoparticle shapes on effective thermal conductivity, axial velocity,
   transverse velocity, temperature, and pressure difference distributions
   along the length of non-uniform channel with variation of different flow
   parameters are discussed with the help of graphical illustrations. It is
   observed that platelet shaped nanoparticles carry maximum velocity
   whereas brick shaped nanoparticles are the best to enhance the thermal
   conductivity. An inherent property of peristaltic transport i.e.
   trapping is also discussed. This model is applicable in drugs delivery

Abstract = {{This paper emphasizes the development of control strategy for inter-area
   oscillation suppression for a unified two-area hydro-thermal deregulated
   power system. A proportional derivative-type fuzzy logic controller with
   integral (PDFLC+I) controller was proposed for automatic generation
   control. Further comparisons among conventional integral controller,
   proportional integral derivative controller, and PDFLC+I are carried
   out, where the PDFLC+I controller is optimized by four different
   optimization techniques namely, algorithm, ant colony optimization,
   classical particle swarm optimization, and adaptive particle swarm
   optimization. In PDFLC+I controller optimization, scaling parameters of
   controllers are optimized. A comparative study shows that the proposed
   PDFLC+I controller has a better dynamic response following a step load
   change for the combination of PoolCo and bilateral contract-type
   transaction in deregulated environment. Proposed controller performance
   has also been examined for +/- 30\% variation in system parameters.
   Non-linearity in the form of governor dead band is taken into account
   during simulation.}},

   radiation}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING COMPUTATIONS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this study is to analyze magnetohydrodynamic
   three-dimensional flow of Casson nanofluid over a stretching sheet in
   presence of thermophoresis and Brownian motion effects. In contrast, the
   convective surface boundary conditions with the effects of radiation are
   applied.
   Design/methodology/approach - The governing partial differential
   equations are transformed into highly nonlinear coupled ordinary
   differential equations consisting of the momentum, energy and
   nanoparticle concentration via suitable similarity transformations,
   which are then solved the using optimal homotopy analysis method (OHAM)
   a Mathematica Package BVPh2.0.
   Findings - The influence of emerging physical flow parameters on fluid
   velocity component, temperature distribution and nanoparticle
   concentration are discussed in detail. Also, an OHAMsolution
   demonstrates very good correlation with those obtained in the previously
   published results. It is noticed that OHAMcan overcome the earlier
   restriction, assumptions and limitation of traditional perturbation
   method. The main advantage of this method is that OHAM can be applied
   directly to nonlinear differential equations without using linearization
   and round-off errors, and therefore, it cannot be affected by error
   associated to discretization.
   Originality/value - Here the approximate solutions are compared with the
   numerical results published in earlier work.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to understand antecedents of
   app-based shopping in an Indian context. The paper has used unified
   theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) 2 model for examining
   the impact of various constructs on behavioral intention and usage
   behavior of smart phone users toward the mobile shopping apps.
   Design/methodology/approach - The constructs were tested and validated
   by means of a structured questionnaire which was administered on a
   sample of 350 mobile app shoppers in Delhi. AMOS 20 was used to analyze
   the collected data.
   Findings - The study revealed that hedonic and habit are the strongest
   predictors of users' behavioral intention to use mobile apps for
   shopping. Respondents are also influenced by the deals that are being
   offered by the marketers. The research also suggests that facilitating
   conditions help in usage of mobile apps for shopping.
   Research limitations/implications - Managerial implications simplifying
   the interface which would encourage the less technologically advanced
   individuals to use mobile apps. Hedonic element of shopping through
   mobile apps should also be enhanced.
   Originality/value - This study contributes to the research on intentions
   and usage behavior of consumer technologies by adopting UTAUT 2 model to
   explain the intentions and usage behavior toward mobile apps for
   shopping. The paper also measured the role of deals in influencing the

Abstract = {{Rotavirus is the leading cause of severe and dehydrating diarrhea in
   children aged under 5years. We undertook this hospital-based
   surveillance study to examine the possible relationship between the
   severity of diarrhea and the various G-group rotaviruses circulating in
   India. Stool samples (n = 2,051) were systematically collected from
   4,711 children aged <5years admitted with severe acute gastroenteritis
   to 12 medical school centers from April 2011 to July 2012. Rotavirus
   testing was undertaken using a commercially available enzyme immunoassay
   kit for the rotavirus VP6 antigen (Premier Rotaclone Qualitative ELISA).
   Rotavirus positive samples were genotyped for VP7 and VP4 antigens by
   reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction at a central laboratory.
   Of the stool samples tested for rotavirus antigen, 541 (26.4\%) were
   positive for VP6 antigen. Single serotype infections from 377 stool
   samples were compared in terms of gastroenteritis severity. Among those
   with G1 rotavirus infection, very severe diarrhea (Vesikari score 16)
   was reported in 59 (33.9\%) children, severe diarrhea (Vesikari score
   11-15) in 104 (59.8\%), moderate (Vesikari score 6-10) and mild diarrhea
   (Vesikari score 0-5) in 11 (6.3\%). Among those with G2 infection, very
   severe diarrhea was reported in 26 (27.4\%) children, severe diarrhea in
   46 (48.4\%), and moderate and mild diarrhea in 23 (24.2 \%). Among those
   with G9 infection, very severe diarrhea was reported in 47 (54.5\%)
   children, severe diarrhea in 29 (33.6\%), and moderate and mild diarrhea
   in 10 (11.9\%). Among those with G12 infection, very severe diarrhea was
   reported in 9 (40.9\%) children and severe diarrhea in 13 (59.1\%). The
   results of this study indicate some association between rotavirus
   serotypes and severity of gastroenteritis.}},

Abstract = {{Analytical solutions are developed for the electro-kinetic flow of a
   viscoelastic biological liquid in a finite length cylindrical capillary
   geometry under peristaltic waves. The Jefferys' non-Newtonian
   constitutive model is employed to characterize rheological properties of
   the fluid. The unsteady conservation equations for mass and momentum
   with electro-kinetic and Darcian porous medium drag force terms are
   reduced to a system of steady linearized conservation equations in an
   axisymmetric coordinate system. The long wavelength, creeping (low
   Reynolds number) and Debye-Hiickel linearization approximations are
   utilized. The resulting boundary value problem is shown to be controlled
   by a number of parameters including the electro-osmotic parameter,
   Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity (maximum electro-osmotic velocity), and
   Jefferys' first parameter (ratio of relaxation and retardation time),
   wave amplitude. The influence of these parameters and also time on axial
   velocity, pressure difference, maximum volumetric flow rate and
   streamline distributions (for elucidating trapping phenomena) is
   visualized graphically and interpreted in detail. Pressure difference
   magnitudes are enhanced consistently with both increasing
   electro-osmotic parameter and Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity, whereas
   they are only elevated with increasing Jefferys' first parameter for
   positive volumetric flow rates. Maximum time averaged flow rate is
   enhanced with increasing electro-osmotic parameter,
   Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity and Jefferys' first parameter. Axial
   flow is accelerated in the core (plug) region of the conduit with
   greater values of electro-osmotic parameter and Helmholtz-Smoluchowski
   velocity whereas it is significantly decelerated with increasing
   Jefferys' first parameter. The simulftions find applications in
   electro-osmotic (E0) transport processes in capillary physiology and
   also bio-inspired EO pump devices in chemical and aerospace engineering.

Abstract = {{This paper describes the performance of thermal storage integrated
   micro-cogeneration system based on single cylinder diesel engine. In
   addition to electricity generated from genset, waste heat from hot
   exhaust of diesel engine was used to heat water in a double pipe heat
   exchanger of 67.70 cm length with inside tube diameter of 3.81 cm and
   outside tube diameter of 5.08 cm. Additionally, a latent heat thermal
   energy storage system was also integrated with this cogeneration system.
   A shell and tube type heat exchanger of 346 mm diameter and 420 mm
   height with 45 tubes of 18 mm diameter each was designed and fabricated,
   to store thermal energy, in which Erythritol (C4H10O4) was used as phase
   changing material. The test results show that micro capacity (4.4 kW),
   stationary, single cylinder, diesel engine can be successfully utilized
   to simultaneously produce power as well as heating, and to also store
   thermal energy. Slight decrease in engine performance was observed when
   double pipe heat exchanger and latent heat thermal energy storage system
   was integrated with engine but the amount of energy which could be
   recovered was significant. Maximum percentage of energy saved was
   obtained at a load of 3.6 kW and was 15.2\%. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This paper aims to open a new vista of research in the direction of
   possible application of power electronics DC-DC converters in analog
   chaotic communication. Most of the work reported on analog chaotic
   communication is based on the pioneer work of Pecora and Caroll, with
   synchronization between transmitter and receiver. Receiver based on
   synchronization, also known as coherent receiver, has a disadvantage of
   parameter mismatch and is sensitive to noise. In the present work,
   firstly, a secure transmitter using chaotic DC-DC converters is proposed
   that encrypts information using chaotic switching map technique. In
   chaotic switching map technique, the message is encrypted by randomly
   switching from one chaotic converter to another. The bifurcation
   parameter of the randomly switched chaotic converter is modulated by the
   message. Secondly, an attempt has been made to design a robust
   non-coherent receiver that is adaptable to the switching chaotic
   transmitters, even in the presence of noise. Once the receiver
   identifies the chaotic converter, it can decode the message as per the
   decryption algorithm. With the proposed non-coherent receiver, the
   disadvantages of coherent receivers can be overcome. We have also
   devised a prototype smart meter, used in smart distribution grid for
   implementing the proposed communication technique. Copyright (C) 2016

Title = {{Mechanistic Basis of Antimicrobial Actions of Silver Nanoparticles}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{NOV 16}},
Abstract = {{Multidrug resistance of the pathogenic microorganisms to the
   antimicrobial drugs has become a major impediment toward successful
   diagnosis and management of infectious diseases. Recent advancements in
   nanotechnology-based medicines have opened new horizons for combating
   multidrug resistance in microorganisms. In particular, the use of silver
   nanoparticles (AgNPs) as a potent antibacterial agent has received much
   attention. The most critical physico-chemical parameters that affect the
   antimicrobial potential of AgNPs include size, shape, surface charge,
   concentration and colloidal state. AgNPs exhibits their antimicrobial
   potential through multifaceted mechanisms. AgNPs adhesion to microbial
   cells, penetration inside the cells, ROS and free radical generation,
   and modulation of microbial signal transduction pathways have been
   recognized as the most prominent modes of antimicrobial action. On the
   other side, AgNPs exposure to human cells induces cytotoxicity,
   genotoxicity, and inflammatory response in human cells in a cell-type
   dependent manner. This has raised concerns regarding use of AgNPs in
   therapeutics and drug delivery. We have summarized the emerging
   endeavors that address current challenges in relation to safe use of
   AgNPs in therapeutics and drug delivery platforms. Based on research
   done so far, we believe that AgNPs can be engineered so as to increase
   their efficacy, stability, specificity, biosafety and biocompatibility.
   In this regard, three perspectives research directions have been
   suggested that include (1) synthesizing AgNPs with controlled
   physico-chemical properties, (2) examining microbial development of
   resistance toward AgNPs, and (3) ascertaining the susceptibility of
   cytoxicity, genotoxicity, and inflammatory response to human cells upon
   AgNPs exposure.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Child health is a key priority on the global health agenda,
   yet the provision of essential and emergency surgery in children is
   patchy in resource-poor regions. This study was aimed to determine the
   mortality risk for emergency abdominal paediatric surgery in low-income
   countries globally.
   Methods: Multicentre, international, prospective, cohort study.
   Self-selected surgical units performing emergency abdominal surgery
   submitted prespecified data for consecutive children aged <16 years
   during a 2-week period between July and December 2014. The United
   Nation's Human Development Index (HDI) was used to stratify countries.
   The main outcome measure was 30-day postoperative mortality, analysed by
   multilevel logistic regression.
   Results: This study included 1409 patients from 253 centres in 43
   countries; 282 children were under 2 years of age. Among them, 265
   (18.8\%) were from low-HDI, 450 (31.9\%) from middle-HDI and 694
   (49.3\%) from high-HDI countries. The most common operations performed
   were appendectomy, small bowel resection, pyloromyotomy and correction
   of intussusception. After adjustment for patient and hospital risk
   factors, child mortality at 30 days was significantly higher in low-HDI
   (adjusted OR 7.14 (95\% CI 2.52 to 20.23), p<0.001) and middle-HDI (4.42
   (1.44 to 13.56), p=0.009) countries compared with high-HDI countries,
   translating to 40 excess deaths per 1000 procedures performed.
   Conclusions: Adjusted mortality in children following emergency
   abdominal surgery may be as high as 7 times greater in low-HDI and
   middle-HDI countries compared with high-HDI countries. Effective
   provision of emergency essential surgery should be a key priority for
   global child health agendas.}},

Title = {{MHD dissipative flow and heat transfer of Casson fluids due to

   slip effects under an oblique magnetic field}},
Journal = {{ACTA ASTRONAUTICA}},
Year = {{2016}},

Pages = {{1-12}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{A theoretical investigation of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flow and heat
   transfer of electrically-conducting viscoplastic fluids through a
   channel is conducted. The robust Casson model is implemented to simulate
   viscoplastic behavior of fluids. The external magnetic field is oblique
   to the fluid flow direction. Viscous dissipation effects are included.
   The flow is controlled by the metachronal wave propagation generated by
   cilia beating on the inner walls of the channel. The mathematical
   formulation is based on deformation in longitudinal and transverse
   velocity components induced by the ciliary beating phenomenon with cilia
   assumed to follow elliptic trajectories. The model also features
   velocity and thermal slip boundary conditions. Closed-form solutions to
   the non-dimensional boundary value problem are obtained under
   physiological limitations of low Reynolds number and large wavelength.
   The influence of key hydrodynamic and thermo-physical parameters i.e.
   Hartmann (magnetic) number, Casson (viscoplastic) fluid parameter,
   thermal slip parameter and velocity slip parameter on flow
   characteristics are investigated. A comparative study is also made with
   Newtonian fluids (corresponding to massive values of plastic viscosity).
   Stream lines are plotted to visualize trapping phenomenon. The
   computations reveal that velocity increases with increasing the
   magnitude of Hartmann number near the channel walls whereas in the core
   flow region (center of the channel) significant deceleration is
   observed. Temperature is elevated with greater Casson parameter,
   Hartmann number, velocity slip, eccentricity parameter, thermal slip and
   also Brinkmann (dissipation) number. Furthermore greater Casson
   parameter is found to elevate the quantity and size of the trapped
   bolus. In the pumping region, the pressure rise is reduced with greater
   Hartmann number, velocity slip, and wave number whereas it is enhanced
   with greater cilia length. (C) 2016 IAA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {{COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{136}},
Pages = {{21-29}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background and objectives: With ongoing interest in CNT nanofluids and
   materials in biotechnology, energy and environment, microelectronics,
   composite materials etc., the current investigation is carried out to
   analyze the effects of variable viscosity and thermal conductivity of
   CNT nanofluids flow driven by cilia induced movement through a circular
   cylindrical tube. Metachronal wave is generated by the beating of cilia
   and mathematically modeled as elliptical wave propagation by Blake
   (1971).
   Methods, results and conclusions: The problem is formulated in the form
   of nonlinear partial differential equations, which are simplified by
   using the dimensional analysis to avoid the complicacy of dimensional
   homogeneity. Lubrication theory is employed to linearize the governing
   equations and it is also physically appropriate for cilia movement.
   Analytical solutions for velocity, temperature and pressure gradient and
   stream function are obtained. The analytical results are numerically
   simulated by using the Mathematica Software and plotted the graphs for
   velocity profile, temperature profile, pressure gradient and stream
   lines for better discussion and visualization. This model is applicable
   in physiological transport phenomena to explore the nanotechnology in
   engineering the artificial cilia and ciliated tube/pipe. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The influence of transverse magnetic field on time-dependent peristaltic
   transport of electrically conducting fluids through a microchannel under
   an applied external electric field with induced electric field effect is
   considered, based on lubrication theory approximations. The
   electrohydrodynamic (EHD) problem is also simplified under the Debye
   linearization. Closed-form solutions for the linearized dimensionless
   boundary value problem are derived. With increasing Hartmann number, the
   formation of bolus in the regime (associated with trapping) is inhibited
   up to a critical value of magnetic field. Flow rate, axial velocity and
   local wall shear stress are strongly decreased with greater Hartmann
   number whereas pressure difference is enhanced with higher Hartmann
   number at low time values but reduced with greater elapse in time. With
   greater electro-osmotic parameter (i.e. smaller Debye length), maximum
   time-averaged flow rate is enhanced, whereas the axial velocity is
   reduced. An increase in electrical field parameter (i.e. maximum
   electro-osmotic velocity) causes an increase in maximum time-averaged
   flow rate. The simulations find applications in electromagnetic
   peristaltic micro-pumps in medical engineering and also ``smart{''}
   fluid pumping systems in nuclear and aerospace industries. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Transmission of radiation fluence through patients body has a
   correlation to the planned target dose. A method to estimate the
   delivered dose to target volumes was standardized using a beam level 0.6
   cc ionization chamber (IC) positioned at electronic portal imaging
   device (EPID) plane from the measured transit signal (S t ) in patients
   with cancer of uterine cervix treated with three-dimensional conformal
   radiotherapy (3DCRT). The IC with buildup cap was mounted on linear
   accelerator EPID frame with fixed source to chamber distance of 146.3
   cm, using a locally fabricated mount. S t s were obtained for different
   water phantom thicknesses and radiation field sizes which were then used
   to generate a calibration table against calculated midplane doses at
   isocenter (D iso,TPS ), derived from the treatment planning system. A
   code was developed using MATLAB software which was used to estimate the
   in vivo dose at isocenter (D iso,Transit ) from the measured S t s. A
   locally fabricated pelvic phantom validated the estimations of D
   iso,Transit before implementing this method on actual patients. On-line
   dose estimations were made (3 times during treatment for each patient)
   in 24 patients. The D iso,Transit agreement with D iso,TPS in phantom
   was within 1.7\% and the mean percentage deviation with standard
   deviation is 1.37\% 2.03\% (n = 72) observed in patients. Estimated in
   vivo dose at isocenter with this method provides a good agreement with
   planned ones which can be implemented as part of quality assurance in
   pelvic sites treated with simple techniques, for example, 3DCRT where
   there is a need for documentation of planned dose delivery.}},

Abstract = {{Alterations in optical transitions and distortions in wave symmetry in
   nano-scale QW (quantum well) heterostructures are seen due to external
   uniaxial strain under different polarizations. This paper reports the
   anisotropy phenomena and optical gain improvement realized in
   In0,3Ga0.7As/GaAs0.4Sb0.6 type-Il QW-heterostructure (well width = 20
   angstrom) under uniaxial strain in the SWIR (short wave infra red)
   region. The detailed study of the band structure, wave functions
   associated with the charge carriers in the respective bands and optical
   gain under electromagnetic field perturbation is reported. The 6 x 6
   diagonal (k) over right arrow center dot (p) over right arrow
   Hamiltonian matrix is evaluated and Luttinger-Kohn model is used for the
   band structure calculation. Optical gain spectrum in the
   QW-heterostructure under uniaxial strain along {[}110] for different
   polarizations of light is calculated. For a charge carrier injection of
   5 x 10(12)/cm(2) the optical gain is similar to 1600/cm under input
   z-polarization, similar to 14500/cm under x polarization and similar to
   15700/cm under y-polarization without external uniaxial strain applied.
   A significant improvement in optical gain is observed under uniaxial
   strain along {[}110] direction under different input polarizations.
   Keeping in views its utilization in optoelectronics due its very high
   optical gain in near-infra-red region in x- or y-polarization mode, such
   structure can be considered as a novel structure. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
