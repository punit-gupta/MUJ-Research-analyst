Abstract = {{Sequential treatment studies have been done using photo-Fenton and
   sono-photo-Fenton, and compared with individual processes to analyze
   possible favorable effects of combined systems for the degradation of
   Reactive Black 5 (RB5). The coupled system enhances the degradation as
   compared to the ultrasound or UV-light irradiation processes along with
   the reduction in treatment time. Batch runs were carried out to
   investigate the process operational conditions: pH, H2O2 dosage, Fe2+
   dosage, and RB5 concentration; to obtain the results at best possible
   operating conditions render advanced oxidation processe (AOP)
   competitive with other processes; and to ensure the rapid and complete
   transformation of the toxic organic compounds to benign chemicals.
   Degradation observed was 69\% under Fenton and 93\% under photo-Fenton
   with experimentally optimized conditions i.e. pH 4, Fe2+ concentration
   0.050gL(-1) and H2O2 0.150gL(-1) after 20min. Sono-photo-Fenton
   treatment enhances the degradation up to 98\% with experimentally
   optimized parameters within 12min of reaction.}},

Abstract = {{We present first ever electron momentum density of RuO2 using 20 Ci
   Cs-137 (661.65 keV) Compton spectrometer at a resolution (Gaussian FWHM)
   of 0.34 a.u. The experimental Compton profile (CP) has been compared
   with the theoretical profiles computed using linear combination of
   atomic orbitals (LCAO) within framework Hartree-Fock scheme and of
   density functional theory. Comparison of theoretical and experimental
   CPs demonstrates usefulness of revised functional of
   Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (so called PBEsol) in computing the electronic
   properties of RuO2. The energy bands and density of states of RuO2 are
   also reported using LCAO and full potential linearized augmented plane
   wave (FP-LAPW) method within PBEsol approximation. The complex
   dielectric functions computed using FP-LAPW method are explained in
   terms of transitions within energy bands. Our results for dielectric
   functions show a good agreement with the available experimental data and
   confirm the Drude like behavior of RuO2. The Fermi surface structure and

Abstract = {{The process of bioweathering involving natural microbes, natural plants
   and transgenic animals has proven to be a very efficient and effective
   tool for detoxifying xenobiotics. The present investigation uses the
   same tool as a device for detoxifying asbestos, a potent carcinogenic
   entity. The cellular mechanism of asbestos toxicity to a certain extent,
   as shown by research, is attributed to its chemical composition
   particularly the presence of iron in its structure. Many bacteria
   release iron chelating compounds, siderophores, which could be
   instrumental in the study. Treatment of asbestos was carried out under
   specific parameters with bacterial isolates native to the mines of
   Rajasthan from which asbestos was collected. An assessment was then done
   to evaluate reduction in iron content of the asbestos fibres by Scanning
   Electron Microscopy-Energy Dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX). A remarkable
   decrease was observed in the iron content of asbestos following
   treatment with most of the bacterial isolates used, which probably could
   form the basis for asbestos bioweathering studies.}},

Journal = {{CASE STUDIES ON TRANSPORT POLICY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{295-303}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Structuring public private partnerships (PPP) in railways is a
   challenge, given its technology base, and obligation as a public and
   affordable mode of transportation. The sector provides strong incentives
   for vertical integration due to economies of scope. However, it is
   evident from the literature that large integrated PPPs in railway
   systems are not feasible due to higher commercial risks. They also
   suffer from implicit cross subsidization since the railway
   infrastructure is capital intensive, common to multiple revenue sources,
   and fare box revenues are generally not sufficient to recover
   investments. This is being addressed by various unbundling approaches in
   recent PPPs. The common unbundling is between infrastructure,
   operations, and services.
   The objective of this research is to explore the potential of unbundling
   further and to come up with a framework that helps policy makers in
   taking macro level decisions on PPP structuring. The research
   disaggregates the railway system into over 40 `elements' wherein an
   element is the smallest unit that can be given to a party for execution.
   However this unbundling would result in significant horizontal and
   vertical interfaces between these elements.
   A sustainable PPP would need to limit the extent of interfaces due to
   transaction costs and risks. This can be achieved by bundling the
   elements horizontally and/or vertically into `entities' to extract the
   best value for a PPP. The governing principles would be scale economies
   (horizontal integration), scope economies (vertical integration), need
   for competition (horizontal disaggregation), level playing field,
   transactional transparency, and need for specialization (vertical
   disaggregation). Additional drivers would be appetite for investment,
   availability of competence and accountability for an entity. The
   findings of the research indicate that the entity formation is one of
   the most crucial aspects of a PPP in railways.
   A consequential critical area is managing the interfaces between
   entities, which are subject to transaction costs and risks. These should
   be carefully identified and addressed by well-designed contractual
   agreements and independent regulation. (C) 2014 World Conference on

Abstract = {{In this study, the authors propose a novel extended continuous time
   birth-death model for reliability analysis of a nanocell device. A
   nanocell consists of conducting nanoparticles connected via randomly
   placed self-assembled monolayer of molecules. These molecules behave as
   a negative differential resistor. The mathematical expression for
   expected nanocell lifetime and its availability, in presence of
   transient errors is computed. On the basis of the model, an algorithm is
   developed and implemented in MATLAB, PERL and HSPICE, to automatically
   generate the proposed model representation for a given nanocell. It is
   used to estimate the success\_ratio as well as the nanocell reliability,
   while considering the uncertainties induced by transient errors. The
   theoretical results for reliability are validated by simulating HSPICE
   model of nanocell in presence of varying defect rates. It is observed
   that the device reliability increases with increase in the number of
   nanoparticles and molecules. A lower and upper bounds for nanocell
   reliability are calculated in theory which is validated in simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Spin-polarized Compton profiles of TbCo2 have been measured to elucidate
   the interesting behavior of spin and orbital moments at different
   temperatures. The magnetic Compton profiles (MCPs) have been analyzed in
   terms of site specific spin moments due to Tb-4f electrons, Co and
   itinerant electrons. The temperature dependence of the orbital moment
   has been deduced using Compton and magnetometry data ranging between 6
   and 300 K. The present data exhibit a decrease in the ratio of orbital
   to spin moments from 43.9\% to 35.0\% (while going from 6 to 300 K).
   First-principles calculations within DFT + U scheme have also been
   performed to confirm the spin-, orbital-and site specific-magnetic
   moments in TbCo2. An antiparallel exchange coupling between the Tb-4f
   and Co spin moments is found. The orbital moment is found to have a
   parallel coupling with the Tb spin moment, as evident from the
   experimental MCPs. From first-principles data it is seen that the
   orbital moments of Tb and Co sites are antiparallel to each other, as in
   the case of their spin magnetic moments. The present experimental study
   also shows an existence of an itinerant moment which is coupled
   ferromagnetically with the Tb-4f spin moment. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Key message Pithecellobium dulce has a huge repository of morphological
   and genetic diversity within the species which has been documented for
   further tree research and breeding programmes.
   A total of 40 accessions of a multipurpose leguminous tree,
   Pithecellobium dulce, differing in morphological and phenological
   characteristics was collected from different locations in Rajasthan and
   genetic diversity assessed using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)
   and inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers. Out of 60 RAPD primers,
   43 decamer primers produced 311 scorable bands of which 223 bands were
   polymorphic. Polymorphic banding patterns with the number of amplified
   fragments varied from 1 (OPA-12 and OPF-17) to 12 (OPF-04, OPT-07,
   OPT-17, OPT-20). Percent polymorphism ranged from 33.3 \% (OPF-07,
   OPA-20, OPT-05) to 89 \% (OPA-13) with an average of 64.34 \%. Out of
   the 20 ISSR primers screened, 8 primers produced 77 amplification
   products of which 55 were polymorphic. The number of bands amplified per
   primer varied between 6 (UBC-820) and 13 (UBC-808 and UBC-816) with
   average band size between 300 and 4,500 bp. Percent polymorphism ranged
   from 38 \% (UBC-817) to 100 \% (UBC-811) with an average of 71 \%.
   Dendrogram constructed on the basis of combined RAPD and ISSR markers
   separated the accessions into five distinct clusters at 53 \% variation
   with Jaccard's similarity coefficient ranging from minimum similarity
   (0.35) between Karoli (K) and Malviya Nagar, Jaipur (MN1) to maximum
   similarity (0.81) between two populations of Kota (K1 and K2). The
   matrices for two markers, RAPD and ISSR, were also compared using
   Mantel's test. The correlation value between the matrices is high (r =
   0.83) indicating good correlation between the two molecular marker
   systems. The study indicated a high level of morphological and genetic
   diversity in P. dulce.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrous bismuth oxides (HBO2) have been reported to have anionic
   sorptive properties. In the present study, removal of fluoride from
   aqueous solution has been explored for its possible application in
   drinking water treatment. The performance of fluoride removal from

   (Fe2+, Mg2+, Ca2+ and Cu2+) in the matrix of hydrous bismuth oxide
   (HBO2). Enhanced fluoride removals properties were observed by addion of
   cations in hydrous bismuth oxide as compared to hydrous bismuth oxide
   alone. The pH of the treated water was remained in the range 6.9-9.1,
   indicating that OH- ions are not released from the adsorbents during
   fluoride adsorption. Characterizations of HBO2 and HBO2 with four
   cationic ligands were achieved by using XRD analyses and the tested
   powders are found crystalline in nature as they show large and sharp
   peaks. FTIR analyses of tested materials support the results obtained
   through XRD analyses. Ca and Mg ions in HBO2 appear to increase the pH

Abstract = {{The present research protocol was developed to locate endophytic fungi
   present inside the healthy leaves of Tinospora cord ifolia. The surface
   sterilized leaf explants after staining with lactophenol cotton blue
   showed the presence of endophytic fungi in intercellular spaces of
   ground, dermal tissue especially in midrib region. Leaves have shown
   dense colonies of endophytic fungi. Microscopic examination of in vitro
   and in vivo leaves has shown mycelium which was dense, branched and
   septate. Hence, the comparative study was conducted in both in vitro and
   in vivo leaves of T. cord ifolia to locate endophytic fungi. The present
   study revealed that the fungi are not only developed in plants under
   natural environment but also under controlled conditions i.e. tissue
   culture of plants. Therefore, the present research work favoured the
   view that endophytes can infect nutrient medium of in vitro culture of
   T. cord ifolia and diversity of endophytic fungi increase after
   hardening and acclimatization of T. cord ifolia plantlets. The presence
   of endophytes in in vitro cultures depends both on age of tissue and
   host genotype. Further studies are required to isolate the endophytic
   fungi, pure culture on PDA plates and their identification to explore
   their biosynthetic pathway. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the present work an effort has been made to estimate the plasma

   ground state atom density, ground state ion density and metastable state
   density from the observed visible spectra of penning plasma discharge
   (PPD) source using least square fitting. The analysis is performed for
   the prominently observed neutral helium lines. The atomic data and
   analysis structure (ADAS) database is used to provide the required
   collisional-radiative (CR) photon emissivity coefficients (PECs) values
   under the optical thin plasma condition in the analysis. With this
   condition the estimated plasma temperature from the PPD is found rather
   high. It is seen that the inclusion of opacity in the observed spectral
   lines through PECs and addition of diffusion of neutrals and metastable

Abstract = {{The use of mobile agents for collaborative processing in wireless sensor
   network has gained considerable attention. This is when mobile agents
   are used for data aggregation to exploit redundant and correlated data.
   The efficiency of agent-based data aggregation depends on the agent
   migration scheme. However, in general, most of the proposed schemes are
   centralized approach-based schemes where the sink node determines the
   migration paths for the agents before dispatching them in the sensor
   network. The main limitations with such schemes are that they need
   global network topology information for deriving the migration paths of
   the agents, which incurs additional communication overhead, since each
   node has a very limited communication range. In addition, a centralized
   approach does not provide fault tolerant and adaptive migration paths.
   In order to solve such problems, we have proposed a distributed
   approach-based scheme for determining the migration path of the agents
   where at each hop, the local information is used to decide the migration
   of the agents. In addition, we also propose a local repair mechanism for
   dealing with the faulty nodes. The simulation results show that the
   proposed scheme performs better than existing schemes in the presence of
   faulty nodes within the networks, and manages to report the aggregated
   data to the sink faster.}},

Abstract = {{Chemical modifications including Ag nanoparticle deposition have been
   performed on electrochemically formed mesoporous silicon (PS) to
   optimize confinement and templating of molecular systems within PS as
   well as to modify the electronic properties of both the host and the
   guest. A complete quenching of photoluminescence (PL) of PS along with a
   considerable change of the optical properties of the dye rhodamine 6G
   (R6G) in PS has been achieved. For all states of preparation of the
   sample, PL, UV/vis transmission spectroscopy and electrical measurements
   were carried out. From our transmission and electrical measurements we
   concluded that the quenching of PL is attributed to a fundamental
   disruption of the luminescence mechanism. A blue shift in the PL peak of
   R6G in PS compared to bulk R6G is attributed to an efficient quantum
   confinement effect.}},

Abstract = {{Feature selection is an optimization problem that selects the features
   that have minimum redundancy and maximum relevance to improve the
   efficiency of algorithms. In this paper, we have proposed a novel
   automatic unsupervised feature selection method based on gravitational
   search algorithm, called AFSGSA (automatic feature selection using
   gravitational search algorithm). In contrast to most of existing
   unsupervised feature selection techniques, the proposed AFSGSA requires
   no prior knowledge of the data to be classified and number of features
   to be selected. AFSGSA determines the optimal number of features of the
   data-set on the run. Statistical property of data-set is used to develop
   a novel threshold setting concept to refine the features. A novel
   fitness function is also proposed to make the search more efficient. The
   performance of AFSGSA has been compared with recently developed
   well-known feature selection techniques. The experimental results reveal
   the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed feature selection technique
   over other existing techniques.}},

Abstract = {{A mathematical study on creeping flow of non-Newtonian fluids (power law
   model) through a nonuniform peristaltic channel, in which amplitude is
   varying across axial displacement, is presented, with slip effects
   included. Thegoverning equations are simplified by employing the long

   difference are obtained. Computational and numerical results for
   velocity profile, pressure gradient, and trapping under the effects of
   slip parameter, fluid behavior index, angle between the walls, and wave
   number are discussed with the help of Mathematica graphs. The present
   model is applicable to study the behavior of intestinal flow (chyme
   movement from small intestine to large intestine). It is also relevant
   to simulations of biomimetic pumps conveying hazardous materials,

Pages = {{1-15}},
Abstract = {{The goal of this investigation is to study the three layered (core
   layer, intermediate layer, and peripheral layer) tubular flow of power
   law fluids with variable viscosity by peristalsis in order to
   investigate the strength of the role played by an artificially generated
   intermediate layer to ease constipation. The solution is carried out
   under the long wavelength and low Reynolds number approximations in the
   wave frame of reference as the flow is creeping one. The stream
   functions for each layer such as core layer, intermediate layer, and
   peripheral layer are determined. The expressions for axial pressure
   gradient, interfaces, trapping, and reflux limits are obtained. The
   effects of power law index and viscosities on pressure across one
   wavelength, mechanical efficiency, and trapping are discussed
   numerically. It is found that the pressure required to restrain
   flowrates and the mechanical efficiency increase with the viscosities of
   the intermediate and peripheral layers as well as with the flow
   behaviour index. It is observed that the axisymmetric flow in intestines
   is less prone to constipation than two-dimensional flow and may be more
   easily overcome with introducing a viscous intermediate layer.}},

Journal = {{COGENT ENGINEERING}},

Volume = {{2}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, multi-walled carbon nanotubes are synthesized by
   arcdischarge and chemical vapor decomposition methods. Multi-walled
   carbon nanotubes are synthesized on thin film of nickel sputtered on
   silicon substrate by thermal chemical vapor deposition of acetylene at a
   temperature of 750 degrees C. The flow of current in arc-discharge
   method varies in the range 50-200 A. Further arc-synthesized carbon
   nanotubes are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and
   the results are compared with nanotubes grown by chemical vapor
   deposition method. XRD result shows a characteristic peak (0 0 2) at
   26.54 degrees corresponding to the presence of carbon nanotubes. SEM and
   TEM results give morphology of as-synthesized multi-walled nanotubes.
   TEM results indicate synthesis of well-graphitized carbon nanotubes by
   arc-discharge method. Dispersion of arc-synthesized nanotubes in SDS
   solution under the effect of different sonication times is studied.
   Dispersion of nanotubes in SDS solution is analyzed using UV-vis-NIR
   spectroscopy and it shows an absorption peak at 260 nm. It was found
   that with the increase in sonication time, the absorption peak in
   UV-vis-NIR spectra will increase and optimum sonication time was 2
   hours. Functionalization of synthesized carbon nanotubes by H2SO4 and
   HNO3 acids has been studied and analysis of functionalized groups has
   been done using FT-IR spectroscopy and compared and the results are
   reported in this paper. FT-IR spectroscopy verifies the presence of
   carboxylic groups attached to carbon nanotubes. These functional groups
   may change properties of carbon nanotubes and may be used in vast
   applications of carbon nanotubes.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, nanoscience and nanotechnology have emerged as a new
   area of fundamental science and are receiving global attention due to

   of nanoparticles which seems to have drawn a quite unequivocal attention
   to the synthesis of stable nanoparticles. Although nanoparticles can be
   synthesized through many conventional methods, biological route of the
   synthesis is more competent than the physical and chemical techniques.
   Biologically synthesized nanoparticles have enjoyed an upsurge of

Abstract = {{Iron aluminide inner coating with alumina top layer is being considered
   as a potential solution for tritium permeation barrier and mitigating
   MHD pressure drop for liquid metal blanket concepts in the fusion
   reactor systems. Hot-dip aluminizing with subsequent heat treatment
   seems to offer a good possibility to produce aluminized coating with
   alumina top layer. 9Cr-1Mo Grade 91 steel samples were hot dipped in Al
   melt containing 2.25 wt\% of Si at 750 degrees C for 3 min. Heat
   treatment was performed at 650, 750 and 950 degrees C for 5 h; samples
   were either air cooled or furnace cooled. Coatings have been evaluated
   by SEM, EDX, X-ray diffraction, microhardness, scratch adhesion and
   Raman spectroscopy. The thickness of the layers and phases formed were
   influenced by the heat treatment adopted. Fe2Al5 was the major phase
   present in the samples heat treated at 650/750 degrees C, whereas FeAl
   and alpha-Fe(Al) primarily made up the outer and inner layers
   respectively in the samples heat treated at 950 degrees C. Cooling
   method deployed affected the hardness. Air cooled samples had
   comparatively higher hardness than furnace cooled samples. The scratch
   test showed the adhesion for the samples heat treated at 950 degrees C
   was much better as compared to the samples heat treated at 650/750
   degrees C. Raman spectroscopy analysis showed the presence of both
   alpha-Al2O3 and gamma-Al2O3 on the surface of the samples heat treated
   at 950 degrees C, while Fe3O4 was present in the furnace cooled sample
   only. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Nanoporous gold (npg) produced by dealloying of Au alloys has been
   recently proposed for many different applications from catalysis to
   bio-sensors. Furthermore, Au alloys constitute an important model system
   in the context of corrosion, dealloying, and stress corrosion cracking.
   Adsorbed self-assembled monolayers of thiol molecules inhibit the
   dealloying reaction. On thiol-modified Cu-Au alloys dealloying finally
   proceeds in a localized reaction instead of a homogeneous process. Using
   ethanethiols as an example, we show here that thiols can be effectively
   removed by application of anodic oxidation. Homogeneous porosity forms
   then after an oxidation step. In-situ X-ray diffraction and crystal
   truncation rod analysis of ethanethiol-modified Au (001) confirms that a
   bare Au surface is recovered after a similar oxidation step. In
   consequence, a multi-step dealloying process including complete initial
   thiol-layers as well as partially or fully re-cleaned surfaces can
   produce different micro-cracks, providing larger scale openings, and
   homogeneous nanoporous Au in between. Such hierarchically structured
   surfaces may show superior applicability for reactions where mass
   transport into the porous layer plays a decisive role for the reaction
   rate or detection probability. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Background: Rotavirus is the leading cause of severe, dehydrating
   diarrhea in children aged <5 years globally, with an estimated 25
   million outpatient visits and 2 million hospitalizations attributable to
   rotavirus infections each year. The aim of this hospital-based
   surveillance was to summarize the local epidemiological and virological
   features of rotavirus and to estimate the disease burden in the
   population under surveillance in India.
   Methods: During the 16 months surveillance period from April 2011
   through July 2012, a total of 4711 children under the age of 5 years
   were admitted with acute diarrhea at 12 medical centers attached to
   medical schools throughout India. Stool samples were randomly collected
   from 2051 (43.5\%) subjects and were analyzed for rotavirus positivity
   using commercial enzyme immunoassay kit (Premier Rotaclone Qualitative
   Elisa) at the respective study centers. Rotavirus positive samples were
   genotyped for VP7 and VP4 by reverse-transcription polymerase chain
   reaction (RT-PCR) at a central laboratory.
   Results: During the study period, maximum number of rotavirus related
   hospitalizations were reported from December 2011 through February 2012.
   Out of the 2051 stool samples tested for rotavirus, overall 541 (26.4\%)
   samples were positive for rotavirus VP6 antigen in stool. The highest
   positivity was observed in the month of December, 2011 (52.5\%) and
   lowest in the month of May, 2011 (10.3\%). We found that majority of the
   rotavirus positive cases (69.7\%) were in children <24 months of age.
   The most common genotypes reported were G1 (38\%), G2 (18\%), G9 (18\%),
   G12 (9\%) and mixed strains (17\%).
   Conclusions: The results of this study confirm the significant burden of
   acute rotavirus gastroenteritis as a cause of hospitalizations in under
   five children in India. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{An efficient protocol of plant regeneration through direct and indirect
   organogenesis in Swertia chirayita was developed. Explants cultured on
   Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with 2,4-D (0.5 mg L-1) with
   combination of Kinetin (0.5 mg L-1) showed the highest frequency (84\%)
   of callusing and 1.0mg L-1 6-benzyladenine (BA) in combination with (100
   mg L-1) Adenine sulphate (Ads) + (0.1 mg L-1) Indole acetic acid (IAA)
   was excellent for maximum adventitious shoot (12.69 +/- 1.30) formation
   in four week of culture. A maximum number of (7.14 +/- 0.99) shoots were
   developed per leaf explants through direct organogenesis. The highest
   frequency of rooting (11.46 +/- 1.56) was observed on MS medium
   augmented with IAA (1.0 mg L-1). Well-rooted shoots transferred to
   plastic pots containing a soilrite: sand mix and then moved to the
   greenhouse for further growth and development. Four major secondary
   metabolites were analyzed and quantified using high performance liquid
   chromatography. Amount of secondary metabolites was found significantly
   higher, in in vitro plantlets compared to in vivo plantlets and callus
   raised from S. chirayita. Higher heavy metal accumulation in in vitro as
   compared to in vivo plantlets correlates higher secondary metabolite
   production supporting that they play regulatory role in influencing the
   plant secondary metabolism.}},

Abstract = {{Gray cotton fabric shows hydrophobic characteristics due to presence of
   non-cellulosic impurities in outermost layers of cotton fiber. In the
   present study, atmospheric pressure plasma treatment for the removal of
   the non-cellulosic impurities from gray cotton fabric is investigated.
   Gray cotton fabric is treated with air dielectric barrier discharge at
   different time interval, and characterized by attenuated total
   reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) and
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Different species formed in plasma
   are identified using optical emission spectroscopy. The results clearly
   show that the plasma treatment improves wettability of gray cotton which
   is due to the removal of non-cellulosic impurities and due to the
   formation of polar carboxylate group. Removal of wax after plasma
   treatment is clearly reflected in ATR-FTIR spectra as disappearance of
   symmetric and asymmetric stretching of alkyl group at 2852.24 and
   2917.81 cm(-1). Further, ATR-FTIR spectroscopy provides a fast and
   satisfactory assessment of removal of impurities from cotton surface
   when untreated and plasma-treated cotton fabric is exposed to HCl vapor
   and subsequently spectra are collected. We observed a strong carboxyl
   peak is induced at 1749 cm(-1) in case of untreated cotton. While for
   plasma-treated cotton fabrics substantial variation in the intensity of
   1641 and 1749 cm(-1) peak is observed with increase in plasma treatment
   time. The morphological changes observed by SEM are in accordance with
   ATR-FTIR results. The results are compared with conventionally (alkaline
   scouring) treated cotton fabric. The study reveals that atmospheric
   pressure plasma has potential to become dry and environment friendly
   process to improve wettability of gray cotton fabric.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, the use of mobile agents in wireless sensor networks (WSNs)
   has emerged as the topic of extensive research due to their efficient
   utilization of network bandwidth and energy, and flexibility of their
   use for different WSN applications. Most of the proposed mobile agent
   based schemes use static itineraries for agents' migration that are
   computed at the sink using a centralized algorithm. These centralized
   algorithms require global knowledge of sensor distribution, which is
   difficult to obtain accurately. Other issue with static itinerary based
   agent migration is that an agent may not move along its itinerary due to
   node failures or malicious node attacks. In order to solve these issues,
   we first propose a framework for trust evaluation to identify the
   malicious behavior of sensor nodes and then give a localized distributed
   protocol, called energy and trust aware mobile agent migration (ETMAM)
   protocol for periodic data gathering application. The results of our
   simulation study show that the ETMAM protocol is effective in improving
   resilience against node failures or malicious nodes attacks. (c) 2014

Title = {{Pharmacy practice and injection use in community pharmacies in Pokhara
   city, Western Nepal}},
Journal = {{BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{APR 28}},
Abstract = {{Background: Community pharmacies in Nepal serve as the first point of
   contact for the public with the health care system and provide many
   services, including administering injections. However, there is a
   general lack of documented information on pharmacy practice and
   injection use in these pharmacies. This study aims to provide
   information about pharmacy practice in terms of service and drug
   information sources, and injection use, including the disposal of used
   injection equipment.
   Methods: A mixed method, cross-sectional study was conducted in 54
   community pharmacies in Pokhara city. Data was collected using a
   pre-tested, semi-structured questionnaire, and also by the direct
   observation of pharmacy premises. Interviews with pharmacy supervisors
   (proprietors) were also conducted to obtain additional information about
   certain points.
   Results: Interviews were carried out with 54 pharmacy
   supervisors/proprietors (47 males and 7 females) with a mean age and
   experience of 35.54 and 11.73 years, respectively. Approximately a half
   of the studied premises were operated by legally recognized
   pharmaceutical personnel, while the remainder was run by people who did
   not have the legal authority to operate pharmacies independently. About
   a quarter of pharmacies were providing services such as the
   administration of injections, wound dressing, and laboratory and
   consultation services in addition to medicine dispensing and counseling
   services. The `Current Index of Medical Specialties' was the most
   commonly used source for drug information. Almost two-thirds of patients
   visiting the pharmacies were dispensed medicines without a prescription.
   Tetanus Toxoid, Depot-Medroxy Progesterone Acetate, and Diclofenac were
   the most commonly-used/administered injections. Most of the generated
   waste (including sharps) was disposed of in a municipal dump without
   adhering to the proper procedures for the disposal of hazardous waste.
   Conclusions: Community pharmacies in Pokhara offer a wide range of
   services including, but not limited to, drug dispensing, counseling,
   dressing of wounds, and administering injections. However, the lack of
   qualified staff and adequate infrastructure may be compromising the
   quality of the services offered. Therefore, the health authorities
   should take the necessary measures to upgrade the qualifications of the
   personnel and to improve the infrastructure for the sake of good
   pharmacy practice and the safer use of injections.}},

Abstract = {{Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death and
   disability in India. Moreover, mortality following an acute myocardial
   infarction is high, which may be due to gaps in secondary prevention in
   general and a lack of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) services in
   particular. This review discusses the availability of CR in India, its
   putative role in reducing adverse outcomes over the long-term and
   suggests a road map for future research to enhance CR in this country.
   Currently, there is limited evidence, conducted in India, demonstrating
   CR efficacy. Moreover, there is currently limited availability of
   outpatient CR programs in India. Even so, there is consensus that CR is
   effective and essential in the CVD population. Therefore, efforts are
   needed to continue CR research in India and facilitate clinical
   implementation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless sensor networks are generally deployed for specific
   applications to accomplish certain objectives over a period of time. To
   fulfill these objectives, it is crucial that the sensor network
   continues to function for a long time, even if some of its nodes become
   faulty. Energy efficiency and fault tolerance are undoubtedly the most
   crucial requirements for the design of an information extraction
   protocol for any sensor network application. However, most existing
   software agent based information extraction protocols are incapable of
   satisfying these requirements because of static agent itineraries and
   large agent sizes. This paper proposes an Information Extraction
   protocol based on Multiple software Agents with Dynamic Itineraries
   (IEMADI), where multiple software agents are dispatched in parallel to
   perform tasks based on the query assigned to them. IEMADI decides the
   itinerary for an agent dynamically at each hop using local information.
   Through mathematical analysis and simulation, we compare the performance
   of IEMADI with a well known static itinerary based protocol with respect
   to energy consumption and response time. The results show that IEMADI
   provides better performance than the static itinerary based protocols.}},

Abstract = {{Expressed sequence tags (EST) are potential source for the development
   of genic microsatellite markers, gene discovery, comparative genomics,
   and other genomic studies. In the present study, 7630 ESTs were examined
   from NCBI for SSR identification and characterization. A total of 263
   SSRs were identified with an average density of one SSR/4.2 kb (3.4\%
   frequency). Analysis revealed that trinucleotide repeats (47.52\%) were
   most abundant followed by tetranucleotide (19.77\%), dinucleotide
   (19.01\%), pentanucleotide (9.12\%), and hexanucleotide repeats
   (4.56\%). Functional annotation was done through homology search and
   gene ontology, and 35 EST-SSRs were selected. Primer pairs were designed
   for evaluation of cross transferability and polymorphism among 11 plants
   belonging to five different families. Total 402 alleles were generated
   at 155 loci with an average of 2.6 alleles/locus and the polymorphic
   information content (PIC) ranged from 0.15 to 0.92 with an average of
   0.75. The cross transferability ranged from 34.84\% to 98.06\% in
   different plants, with an average of 67.86\%. Thus, the validation study
   of annotated 35 EST-SSR markers which correspond to particular metabolic
   activity revealed polymorphism and evolutionary nature in different

Abstract = {{In this study, the simultaneous determination of verapamil
   hydrochloride, gliclazide and simvastatin in pharmaceuticals by
   chemometric approaches using UV spectrophotometry has been reported.
   Spectra of verapamil hydrochloride, gliclazide and simvastatin were
   recorded at several concentrations within their linear ranges and were
   used to compute the calibration mixture between wavelength range of 200
   and 400 nm at an interval of 3 nm in pH 6.8 phosphate buffer containing
   0.5\% sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS). Partial least squares regression
   (PLS) and principle component regression (PCR) were used for chemometric
   analysis of the data. The analytical performances of these chemometric
   methods were characterized by relative prediction errors and recoveries
   (\%) and were compared with each other. These two methods were
   successfully applied to pharmaceutical formulation, tablet, with no
   interference from excipients as indicated by the recovery study results.
   The proposed methods are simple, rapid and can be easily used as an
   alternative analysis tool in the quality control of drugs and
   formulation.}},

Title = {{Bio-medical waste management: situational analysis \& predictors of

Journal = {{INDIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{139}},
Pages = {{141-153}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Background \& objectives: A legislative framework for bio-medical waste
   management (BMWM) was established in the country more than a decade ago.
   Though some studies have identified gaps at local levels, no systematic
   effort was done to collect data from different parts of the country. The
   objective of this nationwide study was to document existing resources,
   infrastructure and practices related to BMWM across the study districts.
   Methods: The study was conducted in 25 districts spread over 20 States
   of India including urban and rural areas. Primary (n=388), secondary
   (n=25) and tertiary care (n=24) health facilities from public (n=238)
   and private (n=199) sector were assessed and scored for the state of
   BMWM through 9 items representing system capacity, availability of
   resources and processes in place. Health facilities were assigned into
   one of the three categories (Red, Yellow and Green) based on the
   cumulative median scores.
   Results: Around 82 per cent of primary, 60 per cent of secondary and 54
   per cent of tertiary care health facilities were in the `RED' category.
   Multivariate analysis indicated that charts at the point of waste
   generation, availability of designated person, appropriate containers
   and bags, availability of functional needle destroyers, availability of
   personal protective gears, segregation of waste at point of generation
   and log book maintenance were independently (OR-between 1.2-1.55; P<0.03
   or less) associated with better BMWM system in the health facilities.
   This was true for both rural-urban and public or private health
   facilities.
   Interpretation \& conclusions: The study highlighted the urgent need for
   greater commitments at policy and programme levels for capacity
   building, and resource investments in BMWM.}},

Abstract = {{The electronic band structure and directional Compton profiles (DCPs) of
   ZnO are studied in this work. Calculations are performed considering a
   set of three schemes based on density functional theory (DFT), the
   Hartree-Fock (HF) method, and a hybrid scheme. All band structures
   predict direct bandgaps. The best agreement with experiment is, however,
   shown by the hybrid scheme. The three schemes are also applied to
   compute DCPs along {[}100], {[}110], and {[}001] directions. These are
   compared with measurements made on single crystals of ZnO employing a
   59.54 keV gamma-ray Compton spectrometer. Calculations overestimate the
   momentum density in the low-momentum region while underestimate the
   anisotropies. Positions of extremes in anisotropies deduced from
   calculations are well reproduced by the measured anisotropies in some
   cases. Within the experimental limits, the DCPs from the HF method are
   in better agreement with the measurements compared with DFT.}},

Abstract = {{Ample amount of research has been done for analysing nonlinear

   electronics converters in spread spectrum communication in recent times
   is catching interest. This paper proposes a methodology for using
   chaotic current mode-controlled DC (Direct Current)-DC (Direct Current)
   boost converter in spread spectrum communication. A noncoherent receiver
   is developed. For this, an Adaline-based adaptive filter is designed to
   recover the message from spread spectrum signal at the receiver end. The
   proposed Adaline-based receiver is tested by transmitting various types
   of message signals while considering white noise at different
   signal-to-noise ratio. For designing noncoherent receiver-based chaotic
   communication, use of power electronics converters is expected to play a
   vital role in the future. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, surface modification of polyester fabric was
   carried out using dielectric barrier discharge in air at atmospheric
   pressure. Control and plasma treated fabric were characteried by
   ATR-FTIR and SEM. The active species present in plasma were identified
   by optical emission spectroscopy. Physical and chemical modification of
   polyester by plasma treatment resulted in a new surface which was more
   hydrophilic due to incorporation of oxygen containing polar functional
   groups as well as had different conformational composition and
   crystallinity. he ATR-FTIR results were clear indication of the
   conversion of trans ethylene glycol residue to gauche one after plasma
   treatment and thus reduction in crystallinity. In comparison to
   untreated, we observed nearly 21 \% increase in color depth upon dyeing
   the non-thermal plasma treated polyester with a commercially available
   natural dye. The improvement in color depth could be correlated as a
   consequence of the surface modification.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic, structural and morphological results are presented on Ni (40
   nm) thin film deposited on self assembled polystyrene ( PS) nanosphere
   arrays by molecular beam epitaxy and the observed properties are
   compared with the results obtained on the similar film simultaneously
   deposited on Si and GaAs substrates prepared under the same environment.
   These nanospheres produce good uniformity over a large area as clearly
   seen in a scanning electron microscopy image. The Ni film grown on these
   nanospheres is polycrystalline in nature with grain size of similar to
   7.5 nm. Corresponding magnetic force microscopy measurements confirm the
   influence of substrate material on magnetic domains in the samples. A
   comparatively higher coercivity of similar to 23 mT is observed
   bymagneto optical Kerr effect measurement performed on Ni (40 nm)/PS,
   while the coercivities of Ni/Si and Ni/GaAs reference films are only
   similar to 13 mT and similar to 15 mT respectively. The observed results
   are interpreted in terms of influence of substrate and growth morphology
   on the magnetic properties of Ni films. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Indians have high rates of cardiovascular disease. Hypertension (HTN) is
   an important modifiable risk factor. There are no comprehensive reviews
   or a nationally representative study of the burden, treatments and
   outcomes of HTN in India. A systematic review was conducted to study the
   trends in prevalence, risk factors and awareness of HTN in India. We
   searched MEDLINE from January 1969 to July 2011 using prespecified
   medical subject heading (MeSH) terms. Of 3372 studies, 206 were included
   for data extraction and 174 were observational studies. Prevalence was
   reported in 48 studies with sample size varying from 206 to 167 331. A
   significant positive trend (P < 0.0001) was observed over time in
   prevalence of HTN by region and gender. Awareness and control of HTN (11
   studies) ranged from 20 to 54\% and 7.5 to 25\%, respectively.
   Increasing age, body mass index, smoking, diabetes and extra salt intake
   were common risk factors. In conclusion, from this systematic review, we
   record an increasing trend in prevalence of HTN in India by region and
   gender. The awareness of HTN in India is low with suboptimal control
   rates. There are few long-term studies to assess outcomes. Good quality
   long-term studies will help to understand HTN better and implement
   effective prevention and management programs. Journal of Human
