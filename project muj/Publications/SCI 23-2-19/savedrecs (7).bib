Title = {{Sustained arc temperature: better marker for phase transformation of
   carbon black to multiwalled carbon nanotubes in arc discharge method}},

Abstract = {{The present study investigates the role of temperature in the formation
   of multiwalled carbon nanotubes from carbon black using arc discharge
   technique. Carbon black has been used as precursor to synthesize carbon
   nanotubes in argon atmosphere. The arc current has been varied from 25
   to 40 A in order to study the morphological changes in carbon black as
   it gets converted to multi walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). We observed
   formation of MWCNTs at an arc current of 25 A; however the recorded
   temperature data suggested correlation of sustained arc temperature with
   the nanotube formation rather than the magnitude of current in its
   absoluteness. Interesting to note is that reported current magnitude in
   published literature are very high (>40 A) for conversion of carbon
   black but the present investigation shows that it is possible to convert
   the carbon black to MWCNTs even at lower current values in case the arc
   temperature is stabilized and sustained for longer period. Detailed
   investigations suggested that a sustained stable critical temperature of
   1400 degrees C-1600 degrees C is essential for the growth of nanotubes
   and an unstable arc causing temperature fluctuation from critical
   temperature value yields very low or no MWCNTs.}},

Abstract = {{Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) remains a poorly understood disorder
   with heterogeneous clinical presentations characterized by focal or
   disseminated lesions that contain excessive CD1a+ langerin+ cells with
   dendritic cell features known as LCH cells. Two of the major questions
   investigated over the past century have been (i) the origin of LCH cells
   and (ii) whether LCH is primarily an immune dysregulatory disorder or a
   neoplasm. Current opinion is that LCH cells are likely to arise from
   hematopoietic precursor cells, although the stage of derailment and site
   of transformation remain unclear and may vary in patients with different
   extent of disease. Over the years, evidence has provided the view that
   LCH is a neoplasm. The demonstration of clonality of LCH cells,
   insufficient evidence alone for neoplasia, is now bolstered by finding
   driver somatic mutations in BRAF in up to 55\% of patients with LCH, and
   activation of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK (where MEK and ERK are
   mitogen-activated protein kinase and extracellular signal-regulated
   kinase, respectively) pathway in nearly 100\% of patients with LCH.
   Herein, we review the evidence that recurrent genetic abnormalities
   characterized by activating oncogenic mutations should satisfy
   prerequisites for LCH to be called a neoplasm. As a consequence,
   recurrent episodes of LCH should be considered relapsed disease rather
   than disease reactivation. Mapping the complete genetic landscape of
   this intriguing disease will provide additional support for the
   conclusion that LCH is a neoplasm and is likely to provide more
   potential opportunities for molecularly targeted therapies.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the velocity slip and thermal slip effects on
   peristaltically driven thermal transport of nanofluids through the
   vertical parallel plates under the influence of transverse magnetic
   field. The wall surface is propagating with sinusoidal wave velocity c.
   The flow characteristics are governed by the mass, momentum and energy
   conservation principle. Low Reynolds number and large wavelength
   approximations are taken into consideration to simplify the non-linear
   terms. Analytical solutions for axial velocity, temperature field,
   pressure gradient and stream function are obtained under certain
   physical boundary conditions. Two types of nanoparticles, SiO2 and Ag,
   are considered for analysis with water as base fluid. This is the first
   article in the literature that discusses the SiO2 and Ag nanoparticles
   for a peristaltic flow with variable viscosity. The effects of physical
   parameters on velocity, temperature, pressure and trapping are
   discussed. A comparative study of SiO2 nanofluid, Ag nanofluid and pure
   water is also presented. This model is applicable in biomedical
   engineering to make thermal peristaltic pumps and other pumping devices
   like syringe pumps, etc. It is observed that pressure for pure water is
   maximum and pressure for Ag nanofluid is minimum.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a mathematical study is conducted of steady
   incompressible flow of a temperature dependent viscous nanofluid from a
   vertical stretching sheet under applied external magnetic field and
   gravitational body force effects. The Reynolds exponential viscosity
   model is deployed. Electrically-conducting nanofluids are considered
   which comprise a suspension of uniform dimension nanoparticles suspended
   in viscous base fluid. The nanofluid sheet is extended with a linear
   velocity in the axial direction. The Buonjiornio model is utilized which
   features Brownian motion and thermophoresis effects. The partial
   differential equations for mass, momentum, energy arid species
   (nano-particle concentration) are formulated with magnetic body force
   term. Viscous and Joule dissipation effects are neglected. The emerging
   nonlinear, coupled, boundary value problem is solved numerically using
   the Runge-Kutta fourth order method along with a shooting technique.
   Graphical solutions for velocity, temperature, concentration field, skin
   friction and Nusselt number are presented. Furthermore stream function
   plots are also included. Validation with Nakamura's finite difference
   algorithm is included. Increasing{''} nanofluid viscosity is observed to
   enhance temperatures and concentrations but to reduce velocity
   magnitudes. Nusselt number is enhanced with both thermal and species
   Grashof numbers whereas it is reduced with increasing thermophoresis
   parameter and Schmidt number. The model is applicable in nano-material
   manufacturing processes involving extruding sheets. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The human intestinal tract is a long, curved tube constituting the final
   section of the digestive system in which nutrients and water are mostly
   absorbed. Motivated by the dynamics of chyme in the intestine, a
   mathematical model is developed to simulate the associated transport
   phenomena via peristaltic transport. Rheology of chyme is modelled using
   the Nakamura-Sawada bi-viscosity non-Newtonian formulation. The
   intestinal tract is considered as a curved tube geometric model. Low
   Reynolds number (creeping hydrodynamics) and long wavelength
   approximations are taken into consideration. Analytical solutions of the
   moving boundary value problem are derived for velocity field, pressure
   gradient and pressure rise. Streamline flow visualization is achieved
   with Mathematica symbolic software. Peristaltic pumping phenomenon and
   trapping of the bolus are also examined. The influence of curvature
   parameter, apparent viscosity coefficient (rheological parameter) and
   volumetric flow rate on flow characteristics is described. Validation of
   analytical solutions is achieved with a MAPLE17 numerical quadrature
   algorithm. The work is relevant to improving understanding of gastric
   hydrodynamics and provides a benchmark for further computational fluid
   dynamic simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing gap between demand and supply of energy has resulted in
   raised prices of conventional energy sources, and concern for clean
   environment has led to increase in use of renewable energy and focus on
   increased energy efficiency. In context of increased energy efficiency,
   energy storage and waste heat recovery play an important role as these
   systems improve overall efficiency of systems. In this study, a latent
   heat thermal energy storage system (LHTESS) for stationary C.I. engine
   exhaust heat was developed and integrated with engine. A shell and tube
   type heat exchanger having 346 mm diameter and 420 mm height with 45
   numbers of tubes with 18 mm diameter was developed to store thermal
   energy, in which Erythritol (C4H10O4) was used as a phase change
   material. The engine performance and the thermal energy storage system
   performance parameters such as amount of heat stored, and charging
   efficiency were evaluated. Slight decrease in the engine performance was
   observed when latent heat thermal energy storage system was integrated
   to engine but amount of energy which could be recovered was significant.
   At a load of 4.4 kW the maximum charging efficiency, recovery efficiency
   and percentage energy saved was 69.53\%, 38\% and 11.33\% respectively.

Abstract = {{Background: Surgical mortality data are collected routinely in
   high-income countries, yet virtually no low-or middle-income countries
   have outcome surveillance in place. The aim was prospectively to collect
   worldwide mortality data following emergency abdominal surgery,
   comparing findings across countries with a low, middle or high Human
   Development Index (HDI).
   Methods: This was a prospective, multicentre, cohort study.
   Self-selected hospitals performing emergency surgery submitted
   prespecified data for consecutive patients from at least one 2-week
   interval during July to December 2014. Postoperative mortality was
   analysed by hierarchical multivariable logistic regression.
   Results: Data were obtained for 10 745 patients from 357 centres in 58
   countries; 6538 were from high-, 2889 from middle-and 1318 from low-HDI
   settings. The overall mortality rate was 1.6 per cent at 24 h (high 1.1
   per cent, middle 1.9 per cent, low 3.4 per cent; P < 0.001), increasing
   to 5.4 per cent by 30 days (high 4.5 per cent, middle 6.0 per cent, low
   8.6 per cent; P < 0.001). Of the 578 patients who died, 404 (69.9 per
   cent) did so between 24 h and 30 days following surgery (high 74.2 per
   cent, middle 68.8 per cent, low 60.5 per cent). After adjustment, 30-day
   mortality remained higher in middle-income (odds ratio (OR) 2.78, 95 per
   cent c.i. 1.84 to 4.20) and low-income (OR 2.97, 1.84 to 4.81)
   countries. Surgical safety checklist use was less frequent in low-and
   middle-income countries, but when used was associated with reduced
   mortality at 30 days.
   Conclusion: Mortality is three times higher in low-compared with
   high-HDI countries even when adjusted for prognostic factors. Patient
   safety factors may have an important role. Registration number:
   NCT02179112 (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov).}},

Abstract = {{The rapid increase in population of India forced people to migrate from
   rural areas and small towns to metropolitan cities for better
   employment, education, and, good lifestyle. Major cities of India were
   industrialized and required more work force in metropolitan cities,
   leading to uncoordinated and unplanned growth, often termed as urban
   sprawl. Urban sprawl destroyed the natural resources such as open green
   space, agricultural land, open water bodies and ground water. In this
   paper, an attempt has been made to monitor urban sprawl using Shannon's
   Entropy model, Remote Sensing, and GIS for city Jaipur, India. The
   changed entropy value during the years 1972-2013 proves more dispersed
   growth in the city. The built-up area of Jaipur has increased from 40
   km2 in 1972 to 400 km2 in 2013. Land use percentage of urban settlement
   is doubled as compared to the urban population of Jaipur during
   1972-2013. This study shows remarkable urban sprawl in fringe areas of
   Jaipur city in the last 41 years.}},

Abstract = {{The optical properties, namely refractive index (RI) studies, are
   reported on a series of pure and doped poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) in
   solution form. The PVA solutions were synthesized with 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
   wt\% of PVA in distilled water followed by doping with Rhodamine B in
   concentrations ranging from 0.05 wt\% to 2 wt\%. The absorption spectra
   show an observable shift in the band edge position towards higher
   wavelength with increase in PVA wt\%. When the dopant molecules are
   added, the curves are drastically modified with the occurrence of new
   peaks arising at higher doping concentrations along with change in the
   bandgap. These effects are prominent for all the concentration of PVA
   solution. The RI does not change much for low doping wt\%. but when
   dopant is added in higher concentrations, it increases slightly reaching
   a maximum of similar to 1.35 at 2 wt\%. It is observed that host polymer
   properties dominate at low doping while a combination of host polymer
   and dopant dye properties dominate at higher doping concentrations.}},

Title = {{Process optimization for green synthesis of silver nanoparticles by
   Sclerotinia sclerotiorum MTCC 8785 and evaluation of its antibacterial
   properties}},
Journal = {{SPRINGERPLUS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JUN 24}},
Abstract = {{Background: Eco-friendly synthesis of nanoparticles is viewed as an
   alternative to the chemical method and initiated the use of
   microorganisms for synthesis. The present study has been designed to
   utilize plant pathogenic fungi Sclerotinia sclerotiorum MTCC 8785 strain
   for synthesis and optimization of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs)
   production as well as evaluation of antibacterial properties. The AgNPs
   were synthesized by reduction of aqueous silver nitrate (AgNO3) solution
   after incubation of 3-5 days at room temperature. The AgNPs were further
   characterized using UV-visible spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy (FTIR) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Reaction
   parameters including media, fungal biomass, AgNO3 concentration, pH and
   temperature were further optimized for rapid AgNPs production. The
   antibacterial efficacy of AgNPs was evaluated against Escherichia coli
   ATCC 25922 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 by disc diffusion and
   growth kinetics assay at the concentration determined by the minimum
   inhibitory concentration (MIC).
   Results: AgNPs synthesis was initially marked by the change in colour
   from pale white to brown and was confirmed by UV-Vis spectroscopy.
   Optimization studies showed that potato dextrose broth (PDB) media, 10 g
   of biomass, addition of 2 mM AgNO3, pH 11 and 80 degrees C temperature
   resulted in enhanced AgNPs synthesis through extracellular route. TEM
   data revealed spherical shape AgNPs with size in the range of 10 nm.
   Presence of proteins capped to AgNPs was confirmed by FTIR. AgNPs showed
   antibacterial activity against E. coli and S. aureus at 100 ppm
   concentration, corresponding MIC value.
   Conclusion: S. sclerotiorum MTCC 8785 mediated AgNPs was synthesized
   rapidly under optimized conditions, which showed antibacterial activity.}},

   forced convective flow of viscous incompressible fluid flow through a
   circular channel filled with a hyper porous medium saturated with a
   rarefied gas in the presence of transverse magnetic field, thermal
   radiation and uniform heat flux at the walls of the channel. For the
   Darcian model, the velocity and heat equations are analytically solved
   and the effects of various physical parameters on thses are discussed.
   In addition, the Entropy generation rate, Nusselt number and Bejan
   number are analyzed for different parameters. It was perceived that
   entropy generation number attains high values due to the thermal
   radiation. This is also concluded that rate of heat transfer upsurges
   due to the radiative heat tansfer and Brinkmann number.}},

   and recording. The plasma is produced using helium gas and admixture of
   three noble gases including helium, neon, and argon. The source is
   capable to produce eight spectral lines for pure helium in the VUV range
   from 20 to 60 nm and total 24 spectral lines covering the wavelength
   range 20-106 nm for the admixture of gases. The large range of VUV lines
   is generated from gaseous admixture rather from the sputtered materials.
   The recorded spectrum shows that the plasma light radiations in both
   visible and VUV range are larger in double ring configuration than that
   of the rectangular configurations at the same discharge operating
   conditions. To clearly understand the difference, the imaging of the
   discharge using ICCD camera and particle-in-cell simulation using VORPAL
   have also been carried out. The effect of ion diffusion, metastable
   collision with the anode wall and the nonlinear effects are correlated
   to explain the results.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the structural and electronic properties of the
   compound Zn3P2. Equilibrium structural properties have been calculated
   by fitting the energy-volume data to standard equation of state. The
   theoretical as well as experimental spherically averaged Compton
   profiles are also determined. The experiment is performed using a 5 Ci
   Am-241 gamma-rays Compton spectrometer, allowing 59.54 keV gamma rays to
   get scattered by the polycrystalline sample and the corresponding
   theoretical profiles are obtained from linear combination of atomic
   orbital method within density functional theory framework. Anisotropy
   curves using three different directions {[}100], {[}110] and {[}111] are
   obtained for the compound and an ionic model is also proposed, which
   supports the transfer of 2.0 electrons from Zn to P atom. At last,
   equal-valence-electron-density profiles for Zn3P2 and Cd3P2 are
   presented, confirming more ionic characters in Zn3P2.}},

Abstract = {{The interest in applying an external pressure on a nano-heterostructure
   is to attempt to extract more information about the electronic structure
   through distortion of the electronic structure. This paper reports the
   tunability of the optical gain under the high pressure effect in
   M-shaped type-Il In0.7Ga0.30As/GaAs0.40Sb0.60 symmetric lasing
   nano-heterostructure designed for SWIR generation. In order to simulate
   the optical gain, the heterostructure has been modeled with the help of
   six band k.p method. The 6 x 6 diagonalized k.p Hamiltonian has been
   solved to evaluate the valence sub-bands (i.e. light and heavy hole
   energies); and then optical matrix elements and optical gain within TE
   (Transverse Electric) mode has been calculated. For the injected carrier
   density of 5 x 10(12)/cm(2), the optimized optical gain within TE mode
   is as high as similar to 9000/cm at the wavelength of similar to 1.95 mu
   m, thus providing a very important alternative material system for the
   generation of SWIR wavelength region. The application of very high
   pressure (2, 5 and 8 GPa) on the structure along {[}110] direction shows
   that the gain as well as lasing wavelength both approach to higher
   values. Thus, the structure can be tuned externally by the application
   of high pressure within the SWIR region. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{We analyze the peristaltic motion of aqueous electrolytes altered by
   means of applied electric fields. Handling electrolytes in typical
   peristaltic channel material such as polyvinyl chloride and Teflon leads
   to the generation of a net surface charge on the channel walls, which
   attracts counter-ions and repels co-ions from the aqueous solution, thus
   leading to the formation of an electrical double layer-a region of net
   charges near the wall. We analyze the spatial distribution of pressure
   and wall shear stress for a continuous wave train and single pulse
   peristaltic wave in the presence of an electrical (electroosmotic) body
   force, which acts on the net charges in the electrical double layer. We
   then analyze the effect of the electroosmotic body force on the particle
   reflux as elucidated through the net displacement of neutrally buoyant
   particles in the flow as the peristaltic waves progress. The impact of
   combined electroosmosis and peristalsis on trapping of a fluid volume
   (e.g., bolus) inside the travelling wave is also discussed. The present
   analysis goes beyond the traditional analysis, which neglects the
   possibility of coupling the net pumping of fluids due to peristalsis and
   allows us to derive general expressions for the pressure drop and flow
   rate in order to set up a general framework for incorporating flow
   control and actuation by simultaneous peristalsis and application of
   electric fields to aqueous solutions. It is envisaged that the results
   presented here may act as a model for the design of lab-on-a-chip
   devices. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{We present seasonal rock magnetic data for 48 surficial soil samples
   collected seasonally around a coal-fired thermal power plant on the
   southwest coast of India to demonstrate how fly ash from the power plant
   is transported both spatially and seasonally. Sampling was carried out
   during pre-monsoon (March), early-monsoon (June), monsoon (September)
   and post-monsoon (December) seasons. Low-and high-frequency magnetic
   susceptibility (chi(lf) and chi(hf)), frequency-dependent magnetic
   susceptibility (chi(fd)), chi(fd) \%, isothermal remanent magnetization
   (IRM), ``hard{''} IRM (HIRM), saturation IRM (SIRM) and inter-parametric
   ratios were determined for the samples. Scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM) was used on limited number of samples. NOAA HYSPLIT MODEL backward
   trajectory analysis and principal component analysis were carried out on
   the data. Fly ash samples ex hi bit an average HIRM value (400.07x10(-5)
   Am-2 kg(-1)) that is comparable to that of soil samples. The pre- and
   post-monsoon samples show a consistent reduction in the concentration of
   magnetically ``hard{''} minerals with increasing distance from the power
   plant. These data suggest that fly ash has indeed been transported from
   the power plant to the sampling locations. Hence, HIRM may perhaps be
   used as a proxy for tracking fly ash from coal-fired thermal power
   plants. Seasonal data show that the distribution of fly ash to the
   surrounding areas is minimum during monsoons. They also point to the
   dominance of SP magnetite in early-monsoon season, whereas magnetic
   depletion is documented in the monsoon season. This seasonal difference
   is attributable to both pedogenesis and anthropogenic activity i.e.
   operation of the thermal power plant.}},

Abstract = {{The present trend of increasing the penetration levels of Distributed
   Generator (DG) in the distribution network has made the issue of
   Islanding crucial for the reliable operation of the network. The
   islanding, if not detected early may lead to the collapse of the system
   as it can drive the distribution system to the cascaded failure. In this
   paper, an extensive study of the effect of DG placement and sizing is
   performed by dividing the system into different zones to obtain a
   reduced effect of islanding. The siting and sizing of DG is carried out
   to improve the overall voltage profile or/and reduction in active power
   loss using two stage Genetic Algorithm (GA). In the first stage a basic
   knockout selection is considered and the best population is taken for
   next stage, where roulette selection for crossover and mutation is
   performed for optimal placement and sizing of DGs. The effect of the
   islanding, due to load variations is reduced by optimal siting and
   sizing of DG. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is tested on the
   IEEE 33 and 69 radial bus systems and the results obtained are
   promising.}},

Abstract = {{A series of laboratory investigations were undertaken to evaluate the

   cement has been replaced by fly ash in all the concrete mixtures. When
   compared to the control mixes, encouraging results were obtained in the
   tests to determine the mechanical properties of the concrete containing
   jarosite. The other important aspect of concrete i.e. durability has
   been revealed as satisfactory. The leaching of jarosite in concrete
   mixtures has been observed within the permissible limits of United
   States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). The addition of jarosite
   as a partial sand replacement in concrete (along with fly ash as mineral
   admixture) up to 25\% could be a new alternative feasible solution to

Abstract = {{A design of two-dimensional hybrid photonic crystal fiber (PCF) with
   elliptical and circular air holes and its analyses for large flattened
   dispersion and high birefringence is presented. The PCF has hexagonal
   layout with triangular lattice. There are five rings around the solid
   core. The inner three rings around the core have elliptical air holes
   while the outer two rings have circular air holes. Three such layouts
   are designed, analyzed, and compared with the layout having only
   circular air hole using full-vector finite difference time domain
   method. The layout with hybrid structure having combined elliptical and
   circular air hole gives a large flattened dispersion of the order of
   4.88 ps/nm/km for the wavelength range of 1.2 to 1.8 mu m and magnitude
   of modal birefringence is 1.238 x 10(-3) at 1.55-mu m wavelength. (C)

   slits in ground plane and U shaped slot in patch and performance
   analysis of antenna is simulated by applying CST microwave studio

   planes at two frequencies namely 2.62 GHz and 3.94 GHz are obtained
   which dictate that co-polar patterns are significantly better than cross

Abstract = {{The present study describes surface modification of leather using

   exposed to dielectric barrier discharge produced in air. DBD plasma
   treatment changes morphology and chemical composition of the surface of

   by Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. The morphology and chemical
   composition of leather surface is studied using scanning electron

   improvement in dye uptake properties after air plasma treatment.
   Different species formed in plasma are identified using optical emission
   spectroscopy. Untreated and plasma treated samples were dyed with
   Eco-Garnet Brown, Eco-Hill Brown III, Eco-Turkey Red and Eco-Smoke Grey
   natural dyes. Dyeing behavior was assessed by spectroscopic measurement
   and by measuring fastness (wash and rub) properties. This has clearly
   indicated an increase in color intensity of plasma exposed leather as
   well as an increase in the dye uptake as compared to the untreated
   leather. Best results were obtained with Eco-Hill Brown III and
   Eco-Smoke Grey dyes. The study reveals that atmospheric pressure plasma

Abstract = {{The screen adaptation of the novella Devdas by Saratchandra
   Chattopadhyay is an important landmark in early Indian cinema. A
   prominent film, screened in four Indian languages (Bengali, Hindi,
   Telugu and Tamil), it seems to offer a novel vision of romantic love and
   romanticism. This article critiques the fanciful interpretations of the
   film provided by some postmodern academics in the field of comparative
   literature. It endeavours to place the film both as text and cinematic
   work into a broader perspective based on the study of intertextuality of
   three renditions: Raghavaiah's Devdas (Telugu, 1953), Bimal Roy's Devdas
   (Hindi, 1955) and Bhansali's Devdas (Hindi, 2002). Grounded in cultural
   theory and Indian performative aesthetics coupled with moving image
   analysis, this study highlights the underlying, deep-rooted romanticism
   embedded in Indian philosophical and aesthetic traditions of devotion
   between atma (individual soul) and paramatma (absolute soul),
   personifying Paro/Chandramukhi as atma and Devdas as paramatma. This
   article, part of a larger project on de-Westernising media studies,
   makes a critical intervention in current South Asian Studies by aiming
   to provide a novel theoretical framework to which the philosophical and
   traditional tenets grounding the novella of Devdas can be anchored.}},

Abstract = {{Influence of ionization is studied on two stream instability (TSI) in an
   inhomogeneous plasma in the presence of obliquely applied magnetic
   field. In addition to the usual TSI, a new type of instability is found
   to occur in this system, which is driven by the magnetic field and
   survives for relatively longer wavelength of oscillations. The growth
   rates of both the instabilities are enhanced by the magnetic field but
   their magnitudes attain a minimum value at certain angles of the wave
   propagation depending upon the wavelength of oscillations. At a critical
   value of ionization rate there is a sudden fall in the growth of both
   the instabilities, the reason of which is understood as the Landau
   damping. A further enhancement in the ionization suppresses the usual
   TSI whereas the magnetic field-driven instability attains much lower
   growth. This new type of instability grows faster in the plasma having
   heavier ions, but shows a weak dependence on the charge of the ions. (C)

Abstract = {{The science of Geomicrobiology, which deals with mineral- microbe
   interaction in nature contributes effectively to three important
   processes namely-mineral and metal bioremediation, biomining and soil
   mineral formation by microbes. Bioremediation one of the important
   process of the above, degrades or transforms hazardous contaminants to
   less toxic compounds. Several groups of fungi have proved highly
   efficient in this aspect, with asbestos being one such toxic entity in
   the environment on which their activity was studied. The present
   investigation uses the same tool as a device for detoxifying asbestos, a
   potent carcinogenic entity; with fungal isolates native to the asbestos
   mines of Rajasthan, India, being investigated for the first time. The
   cellular mechanism of asbestos toxicity is mainly attributed to the
   presence of iron in its chemical composition which catalyzes generation
   of free radicals leading to oxidation of biomolecules. The two dominant
   novel species found therein, identified as Aspergillus tubingenesis and
   Coemansia reverse have proved capable of actively removing iron from
   asbestos fibers as studied by scanning electron microscopy-electron
   diffraction X-ray (SEM-EDX) analysis. This probably could lead to a
   reduction in toxicity of asbestos, due to reduced iron concentration as
   reported in related studies. Many fungi are known to release iron
   chelating compounds, siderophores, which could be instrumental in the
   study. The findings related to two new fungal species being added to the
   list of earlier identified fungal bioremediators of asbestos, widens the
   prospect of using bioremediation as an effective tool for asbestos
   detoxification. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past few years, designing of progressive visual recovery
   technique has been studied by many researchers. Previous research on PVC
   were all carrying pixel-expansion problem. Young et al. (2013) suggested
   a new dimension of Progressive visual secret sharing with the feature of
   Block based encoding and recovery of an original secret. In the Young
   scheme (2013), a secret image is subdivided into n non-overlapped image
   sections. When L (2 <= L <= n) participants stack their shadow images,
   all the image sections associated with these L participants will be
   recovered. In this article, the scheme suggested for a block based
   progressive scheme is critically analyzed and we show that leakage of
   secret information is possible in the scheme during the encoding process
   of the shares. Further, we propose a new robust progressive algorithm
   based on the logistic chaotic map to overcome the said limitation. The
   irregular outputs of the logistic map are used to encode a secret
   digital image. To provide robustness during the encoding process of the
   share, noise has been introduced along with chaotic sequences. The
   performance of the algorithm in the scheme of Young is critically
   analyzed and compared with the new suggested scheme. The empirical
   results are presented to showcase the performance of our proposed scheme
   in terms of its effectiveness and feasibility.}},

Abstract = {{The present study investigates the radiation effects in flow through

   into nonlinear normal differential equation using similarity
   alterations. Transformed system of equations is solved numerically by
   using Runge-Kutta method with shooting technique. Effects of various
   parameters such as porosity parameter K, suction parameter W-s,
   rotational Reynolds number Re, Knudsen number Kn, Prandtl number Pr,
   radiation parameter N, and relative temperature difference parameter
   epsilon on velocity profiles along radial, tangential, and axial

Abstract = {{Objectives: To evaluate, in the FLEX Registry, clinical outcomes of an
   ultrathin ( 60 mu m) biodegradable polymer-coated Supraflex
   sirolimus-eluting stent (SES) for the treatment of coronary artery
   disease. Additionally, to determine the vascular response to the
   Supraflex SES through optical coherence tomography (OCT) analysis.
   Setting: Multicentre, single-arm, all-comers, observational registry of
   patients who were treated with the Supraflex SES, between July 2013 and
   May 2014, at nine different centres in India.
   Participants: 995 patients ( 1242 lesions) who were treated with the
   Supraflex SES, between July 2013 and May 2014, at nine different centres
   in India. A total of 47 participants underwent OCT analysis at 6 months'
   follow-up.
   Interventions: Percutaneous coronary intervention with Supraflex SES.
   Primary and secondary outcome measures: The primary endpoint-the rate of
   major adverse cardiac events ( defined as a composite of cardiac death,
   myocardial infarction (MI), target lesion revascularisation (TLR))-was
   analysed during 12 months.
   Results: At 12 months, the primary endpoint occurred in 36 (3.7\%) of
   980 patients, consisting of 18 ( 1.8\%) cardiac deaths, 16 ( 1.6\%) MI,
   7 ( 0.7\%) TLR and 2 ( 0.2\%) cases of non-target lesion target vessel
   revascularization. In a subset of 47 patients, 1227 cross-sections (
   9309 struts) were analysed at 6 months by OCT. Overall, a high
   percentage of struts was covered ( 98.1\%), with a mean neointimal
   thickness of 0.13 +/- 0.06 mu m.
   Conclusions: The FLEX Registry evaluated clinical outcomes in real-world
   and more complex cohorts and thus provides evidence that the Supraflex
   SEX can be used safely and routinely in a broader percutaneous coronary
   intervention population. Also, the Supraflex SES showed high percentage
   of stent strut coverage and good stent apposition during OCT follow-up.}},

Title = {{EFFECT OF AMBIENT TEMPERATURE RISE ON THE LED LIFE TIME RESOURCE}},
Journal = {{LIGHT \& ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{56-60}},
Abstract = {{The impact of ambient temperature rise and, therefore T-point
   temperature rise too, on the life time of LEDs is analysed in this
   paper. From the research conducted so far it is understood that life
   time resource of LEDs is mainly dependent on junction temperature. For
   most of the high power LEDs, which are enclosed inside a luminaire,
   dissipation of junction heat from the device is a major concern for most
   of the manufacturers. In this paper, an attempt has been made to
   investigate the underlying constraints of heat dissipation and
   subsequently using LEDs as a general light source.
   The investigation is carried out in two steps. Firstly, the degradation
   in light output with corresponding increase in ambient temperature is
   explored. Secondly, the impact of increase in T-point temperature on the
   lifetime of the LEDs is observed. The experiment is conducted using high
   power LEDs and the same is subjected to external thermal stress. The
   temperature inside the environmental chamber represents the ambient
   temperature for the LED and thus by gradually increasing the ambient
   temperature the T-point temperature is also increased. The temperature
   of the chamber and the T-point are measured by using k-type
   thermocouple. The corresponding data hence obtained are tabulated and
   correlated with light output. The results are analysed using statistical
   tool to obtain the relation between the parameters.}},

Abstract = {{The energy band alignment at the heterointerfaces plays a vital role in
   understanding the physics and optical processes such as optical gain or
   optical absorption in semiconductor opto-electronic devices. This paper
   reports the behavior of field effective energy band alignment followed
   by the behavior of probability density of the charge carriers in the
   respective bands of type-I Al(10.45)Ga(0.55)AS/GaAS(0.84)P(0.16)
   symmetric nano-scale-heterostructures. In addition, the optical gain of
   the structure within TE (transverse electric) and TM (transverse
   magnetic) modes under constant electric field applied is also simulated
   and analyzed. In order to simulate the optical gain of the structure, 4
   x 4 diagonal k.P Hamiltonian matrix is solved for the purpose of getting
   envelope functions associated with carriers, carrier densities,
   dispersion curves of the quantum well structure, transition matrix
   elements and finally the optical gain. On behalf of simulated results
   achieved, it is reported that the optical gain in TM mode is found much
   greater than that in TE mode which is opposite to usual trends.
   Moreover, the application of external electric field along the growth
   direction shows that the optical gain within TM mode and the wavelength
   both can be controlled by controlling the electric field applied. Thus,
   the nano-heterostructure can be tuned externally by the application of
   external electric field within the NIR (near infra red) region. (C) 2016

   brown due to phenolic substance secreted by the explant. This problem
   was overcome by using adjuvant PVP (0.1\%). Further, secondary
   metabolites were isolated from callus and field leaf through soxhlet
   extractor and fractionated by using column chromatography. The
   antibacterial activity of these fractioned extracts from
   Tinosporacordifolia callus and leaf were seen against multi drug

Abstract = {{A single-unit system is analyzed by considering the concepts of
   degradation and maintenance subjected to random shocks. A single server
   is called immediately to do repair activities. The maintenance of system
   is done by the server if it is suffered by the impact of shock. However,
   upon failure server repairs the unit. Repair of the unit is not perfect
   and it does not work as new after repair so called a degraded unit. The
   degraded unit is replaced by new one in case it is affected by the
   impact of shock. Server conducts inspection of degraded failed unit upon
   its failure to check the possibility of its repair. If repair of the
   unit is not possible, it is replaced by new one with some replacement
   time. Repair, maintenance, inspection, and replacement times all are
   arbitrary distributed whereas failure and shock times of the unit are
   exponentially distributed. Using regenerative point technique and
   semi-Markov process recurrence relations for several reliability
   measures are obtained. The numerical results for MTSF, steady state
   availability and profit functions are obtained with respect to shock

Abstract = {{Background: Unsafe injection practice can transmit various blood borne
   infections. The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge and
   practice of injection safety among injection providers, to obtain
   information about disposal of injectable devices, and to compare the
   knowledge and practices of urban and rural injection providers.
   Methods: The study was conducted with injection providers working at
   primary health care facilities within Kaski district, Nepal. Ninety-six
   health care workers from 69 primary health care facilities were studied
   and 132 injection events observed. A semi-structured checklist was used
   for observing injection practice and a questionnaire for the survey.
   Respondents were interviewed to complete the questionnaire and obtain
   possible explanations for certain observed behaviors.
   Results: All injection providers knew of at least one pathogen
   transmitted through use/re-use of unsterile syringes. Proportion of
   injection providers naming hepatitis/jaundice as one of the diseases
   transmitted by unsafe injection practice was significantly higher in
   urban (75.6\%) than in rural (39.2\%) area. However, compared to urban
   respondents (13.3\%), a significantly higher proportion of rural
   respondents (37.3\%) named Hepatitis B specifically as one of the
   diseases transmitted. Median (inter-quartile range) number of
   therapeutic injection and injectable vaccine administered per day by the
   injection providers were 2 (1) and 1 (1), respectively. Two handed
   recapping by injection providers was significantly higher in urban area
   (33.3\%) than in rural areas (21.6\%). Most providers were not aware of
   the post exposure prophylaxis guideline.
   Conclusion: The knowledge of the injection providers about safe
   injection practice was acceptable. The use of safe injection practice by
   providers in urban and rural health care facilities was almost similar.
   The deficiencies noted in the practice must be addressed.}},

Abstract = {{The main concentration of the present paper is to analyze the impact of
   abnormal weather conditions on various reliability measures of a
   repairable system of single-unit. For this purpose, a reliability model
   is developed in which unit may fail totally either directly from normal

   plays the dual role of inspection and repair. The totally failed unit is
   first inspected by the server to examine the feasibility of its repair.
   If repair of the unit is not feasible, it is replaced by new one. The
   operation, inspection, replacement and repair of the unit are stopped in
   abnormal weather as a precautionary measure to avoid excessive damage to
   the system. Failure rates, repair rates, inspection rates, and rate of
   change of weather conditions follow general distribution like Weibull
   distribution. By using semi-Markov process and regenerative point
   technique some reliability and economic measures of system effectiveness
   are obtained. The graphical behavior of MTSF and profit with respect to

Abstract = {{Due to its large scale applications in the real field, the study of
   bi-metallic nano-alloy clusters is an active field of research. Though a
   number of experimental reports are available in this domain, a deep
   theoretical insight is yet to receive. Among several nano-clusters, the
   compound formed between Cu-Ag has gained a large importance due to its
   remarkable optical property. Density Functional Theory (DFT) is one of
   the most popular approaches of quantum mechanics to study the electronic
   properties of materials. Conceptually, DFT based descriptors have turned
   to be indispensable tools for analyzing and correlating the experimental
   properties of compounds. In this venture, we have analyzed the
   experimental properties of the (Cu-Ag)(n) (= 1 - 7) nano-alloy clusters
   invoking DFT methodology. A nice correlation has been found between
   optical properties of the aforesaid nano-clusters with our evaluated
   theoretical descriptors. The similar agreement between experimental bond
   length and computed data is also reflected in this analysis. Beside
   these, the effect of even-odd alternation behavior of nano compounds on
   the HOMO-LUMO gap is very important in our computation. It is probably
   the first attempt to establish such type of correlation.}},

Abstract = {{A process model has been developed to study the pyrolysis of biomass to

   products were used to generate heat and electrical power, whereas the
   bio-oil was stored and supplied for other applications. The overall
   efficiency of the base case model was estimated for conversion of
   biomass into useable forms of bio-energy. It was found that the proposed
   design is not only significantly efficient but also potentially suitable
   for distributed operation of pyrolysis plants having centralised post
   processing facilities for production of other biofuels and chemicals. It
   was further determined that the bio-oil quality improved using a
   multi-stage condensation system. However, the recycling of flue gases
   coming from combustor instead of non-condensable gases in the pyrolyzer
   led to increase in the overall efficiency of the process with
   degradation of bio-oil quality. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study is to closely examine the evidence of
   decoupling of economic growth from environmental degradation as
   experienced by OECD member countries. In order to analyze these aspects
   and to explore the comparative assessment, this work has utilized
   available statistical data of OECD. The study employed DPSIR methods
   outlined in the OECD report, which state that Indicators measure the
   decoupling of environmental pressure from economic growth for analyzing
   environmental pressure/degradation indicators, such as population
   growth, energy production, greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, CO2 emission,
   SOx emission, NOx emission, water abstraction and waste with economic
   indicator, i.e., nominal and per capita GDP. The major finding of this
   study is that among the selected indicators, some resulted from relative
   decoupling rather than absolute decoupling, which means that the
   environmental pressure still increases, albeit at a lower rate than
   economic performance, and that the presence of decoupling is not an
   indication for sustainable economic development.}},

   The experimental work for the synthesis of CNTs is performed at MRC,
   MNIT Jaipur. In this paper, the synthesis of carbon nanotubes is
   reported and also their fabrication and characterization. The reported
   procedure for the synthesis of carbon nanotubes is a five step process
   for CVD in order to obtain a high yield and purity.}},
