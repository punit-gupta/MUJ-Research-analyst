Abstract = {{A new class of chemosensors (Ll-L3) based on sequential coupling of
   2,3-diaminomaleonitrile, 4-formyl-1-substituted
   phenyl-pyrazole-3-carboxylate and 2-hydroxy-l-naphthaldehyde through
   imine linkages were successfully designed and synthesized. The
   synthesized chemosensors showed quick colorimetric response with
   excellent selectivity and sensitivity towards detection of Mn2+ and Zn2+
   ions in preference of other cations. Along with this, chemosensors also
   serve as fluorescent turn `off' and turn `on' switch for detection of
   Mn2+ and Zn2+ ion respectively. Analytical characterization were
   evaluated using UV-vis titration, fluorescent titration and Job's plot
   methods which revealed that sensor interact with Mn2+ and Zn2+ ion in
   1:1 and 1:2 binding stoichiometry respectively. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{This paper aims to analyze the electroosmotic flow of non-Newtonian
   ionic nanoliquids in presence of peristaltic propulsion. A geometric
   model is employed for a microfluidic tapered channel flow regime.
   Williamson's fluid model is utilized to characterize non-Newtonian
   nature of the base fluid. The normalized governing equations are reduced
   with lubrication approximations (long wavelength and low Reynolds number
   assumptions). Poisson-Boltzmann equation is also simplified by using
   Debye-Huckel linearization. No slip conditions are imposed at the
   channel walls. The analytical solutions are obtained for temperature
   field and nanoparticle volume fraction. However, a perturbation method
   is used to find out an approximate solution for axial velocity, pressure
   rise and volumetric flow rate. The perturbation solutions are further
   graphically illustrated with MATLAB software. The perturbation solution
   is also validated with numerical results simulated by MATLAB coding
   through BVP command. The effects of thermal radiation and non-Newtonian
   parameters on flow characteristics, pumping characteristics, wall shear
   stress and trapping phenomenon are discussed. A comparative study is
   also made to study the electroosmotic flow through uniform and
   nonuniform asymmetric microfluidic channel. This model can help to study
   the intrauterine fluid dynamics governed by electroosmosis mechanism. It
   can also be applicable in drug delivery, in vivo diagnostics, food
   diagnostics, packaging (smart sensors), DNA chips, protein chips and
   cell chips. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The transportation of biological and industrial nanofluids by natural
   propulsion like cilia movement and self-generated contraction-relaxation
   of flexible walls has significant applications in numerous emerging
   technologies. Inspired by multi-disciplinary progress and innovation in
   this direction, a thermo-fluid mechanical model is proposed to study the
   entropy generation and convective heat transfer of nanofluids fabricated
   by the dispersion of single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) nanoparticles
   in water as the base fluid. The regime studied comprises heat transfer
   and steady, viscous, incompressible flow, induced by metachronal wave
   propulsion due to beating cilia, through a cylindrical tube containing a
   sparse (i.e., high permeability) homogenous porous medium. The flow is
   of the creeping type and is restricted under the low Reynolds number and
   long wavelength approximations. Slip effects at the wall are
   incorporated and the generalized Darcy drag-force model is utilized to
   mimic porous media effects. Cilia boundary conditions for velocity
   components are employed to determine analytical solutions to the
   resulting non-dimensionalized boundary value problem. The influence of
   pertinent physical parameters on temperature, axial velocity, pressure
   rise and pressure gradient, entropy generation function, Bejan number
   and stream-line distributions are computed numerically. A comparative
   study between SWCNT-nanofluids and pure water is also computed. The
   computations demonstrate that axial flow is accelerated with increasing
   slip parameter and Darcy number and is greater for SWCNT-nanofluids than
   for pure water. Furthermore the size of the bolus for SWCNT-nanofluids
   is larger than that of the pure water. The study is applicable in
   designing and fabricating nanoscale and microfluidics devices,
   artificial cilia and biomimetic micro-pumps.}},

   approaches to dynamically manage load balancing. DWLM approaches use
   transfer, selection, and location polices. These policies work based on
   an information policy. The authors map the result in migration time,

   bioactivity of the prepared CuNPs. In vitro anti-microbial efficiency of
   CuNPs was estimated against bacterial and fungal strains by the agar
   well diffusion method. Anti-oxidant capacity of CuNPs was determined
   using ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP), lipid peroxidation (LPO)
   and peroxidase assays, while the antiplatelet potential was determined
   by measuring two haemostatic parameters (PT \& APTT assay). The minimum
   inhibitory concentration was observed at 60 mu g/ml against Streptomyces
   griseus and Aspergillus niger when NPs were prepared by method II. CuNPs
   prepared by the method I showed higher FRAP and LPO activities, while
   increased POX activity was found in CuNPs prepared by method II. CuNPs
   prepared using method I also showed better anti-oxidant and antiplatelet
   potential. It was observed that M. oleifera-derived CuNPs exhibits
   strong anti-microbial, anti-oxidant and APTT potential. This indicates
   potential utilization of green synthesized NPs for various industrial

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a resilient, bandwidth scalable and energy efficient
   WDM-TDM passive optical network (PON) architecture that provides network
   access services to the end user at very high data rates and reduces the
   power consumption of access network significantly in the presence of low
   traffic/underutilized network. The proposed power saving technique
   includes the efficient use of proper line cards (LC) and adaptive link
   rate (ALR) mechanism at optical line terminal located at the central
   office. In the presence of low traffic, ALR switches link rate from 10
   to 1 Gbps depending on the particular threshold value of traffic load.
   In the presence of narrowband traffic, a significant amount of energy is
   saved. Proposed architecture also saves capital expenditure (CAPEX) at
   remote node and reduces significant CAPEX for larger networks. This
   architecture also provides network resiliency against LC/TRx or module
   failure and bandwidth scalability to support future generation PON
   architectures without any service interruption.}},

Abstract = {{Moringa oleifera Lam. (vern. Drumstick) is a mineral rich, medicinally
   important tree species of family Moringaceae. It has a wide range of
   culinary applications and has bioremediation, nutritional and medicinal
   properties. Conventionally, seeds of the tree have been used as natural
   coagulants and flocculents in waste water treatment. Its leaves and bark
   act as biosorbent for remediation of heavy metals and dyes. The tree
   provides remedies for a range of diseases and disorders by dint of its
   unique combination of numerous phytochemicals. Gum exudates of the tree
   are of immense medicinal importance due to their applications in
   biodegradable drug delivery systems and in treatment of asthma,
   dysentery and intestinal cancer. The multidimensional utilities of M.
   oleifera may cause overexploitation of this tree, posing danger to the
   existing natural variability in the near future. Therefore, there is a
   need for conservation of the species for ethnobotanical,
   pharmacological, nutraceutical and biodiversity purposes. Development of
   tissue culture propagation methods will assist in preserving some of the
   germplasm of the species. In the present review, consolidated analysis
   of the role of biotechnology in conservation and genetic enhancement of
   nutritional, medicinal and commercial value of the tree has been placed
   in perspective, together with an up to date review on phytochemical
   analysis of the plant, and its utility has been discussed to invite the
   attention of the scientific community to further consider the study of
   this miracle tree species and its nutritional and pharmaceutical
   properties.}},

Abstract = {{Electro-osmotic peristaltic transport of aqueous nanofluids in a
   two-dimensional micro-channel is examined analytically. Such flows arise
   in bio-mimetic pumping systems at the very small scale of interest in
   physiological treatment e.g. occular drug delivery systems. Complex
   waveforms are imposed at the walls to mimic sophisticated peristaltic
   wave propagation scenarios. Nano-particles are assumed to be in local
   thermal equilibrium. Joule electro-thermal heating is included. The
   dimensional conservation equations are linearized and transformed from
   the wave to the fixed (laboratory) frame under lubrication theory
   approximations. The emerging dimensionless model features a number of
   important thermo-physical, electrical and nanoscale parameter, namely
   thermal and solutal (basic density) Grashof numbers, nanoscale Brownian
   motion parameter, thermophoresis parameter, Helmholtz-Smoluchowski
   velocity (maximum electro-osmotic velocity), Debye electrokinetic length
   and Joule heating to surface heat flux ratio. Closed-form solutions are
   derived for the nano-particle volume fraction, temperature, axial
   velocity, averaged volumetric flow rate, pressure difference across one
   wavelength, skin friction (wall shear stress function), Nusselt number
   (wall heat transfer rate) and stream function distribution in the wave
   frame. The influence of selected parameters on these flow variables is
   studied with the aid of graphs. Bolus formation is also visualized and
   streamline distributions are observed to be strongly influenced and
   asymmetric in nature. (C) 2017 The Society of Powder Technology Japan.

Abstract = {{Metal-halide perovskites are rapidly emerging crystalline materials that
   are reasonably preferred as leading aspirant for applications in
   optoelectronic and thermoelectric devices. In this paper, we have
   thoroughly reviewed and performed calculations to reveal optoelectronic
   and transport properties for a potential newcomer, Cs2PdX6 (X = Cl, Br)
   termed as Cesium Palladium Halides (CPH). Outcome of present
   computations are compared with available results and a reasonable
   agreement is recorded. Energy band gap computations performed reveal
   indirect band gap of 2.29 eV for Cs2PdC16, which substantially reduces
   to 1.22 eV when `Cl' is replaced by `Br'. Optical absorption spectra
   investigations performed here, in the energy range from 3 to 5 eV
   confirms effective utilization of these compounds in solar cells and
   other optoelectronic applications. In addition, the transport properties
   computations performed using semi-classical Boltzmann theory, shows
   constant pattern of thereto power near ambient temperature range
   (200-500 K), which admits possible utilization of these compounds as low
   temperature thermoelectric materials. Performed ZT calculations
   demonstrates reasonably good thermoelectric performance for both
   materials, as there exist minor variation (0.1) in the values over wide
   temperature ranges i.e. from 100 to 800 K. Further, detailed analysis of
   transport properties predicts p-type semiconducting nature of the
   present series of materials.}},

Abstract = {{Oxime-modified aluminium(III) isopropoxide,
   {[}Al(O(l)1Pr)(ONC(CH3)(2)\}(2)] was used as a sol-gel precursor to
   deposit alumina film on steel substrate by dip coating method. The
   thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the above compound indicates its
   clean one step decomposition to alumina at low temperature, making it a
   suitable spray pyrolysis deposition (SPD) precursor for deposition of
   alumina film over steel at 400 degrees C. The formed alumina films (dip
   and spray coated) were characterized by Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron
   Microscopy (SEM) and Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopic (EDX)
   techniques. The XRD patterns of the films suggest deposition of
   amorphous alumina films while the MIR and EDX analyses indicate the
   presence of alumina film on steel substrate. SEM images of coated
   samples indicate deposition of crack-free alumina films. The thickness
   of alumina films (dip and spray coated) were found to be in the range of
   similar to 1.4 +/- 0.2 mu m as indicated by their cross sectional views.
   The corrosion protection of the deposited alumina films has been checked
   by the electrochemical studies; open circuit potential (OCP),
   electro-chemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and potentiodynamic
   polarization. The electrochemical studies suggest corrosion resistive
   nature of the alumina film in 15\% (w/v) NaCl solution.}},

Abstract = {{Technologies such as the integration of distributed generations (DGs)

   achieve optimum performance. This study proposes a long-term
   distribution system planning methodology to determine the optimal sizing
   and siting of SCs and mix of dispatchable and intermittent DGs. More
   practical formulations are suggested while considering realities of
   modern distribution systems with reference to the stochastic nature of
   load demand and power generation among distribution buses on account of
   diversity, variability and uncertainty. The long-term costs in the
   proposed planning model include several techno-economic and social
   objectives pertaining to investment, operation and maintenance of these
   distributed resources and the revenue generated by sale of electricity
   to customers and the utility grid. The proposed planning model is more
   practical as it fully considers the system uncertainties and variability
   in load and power generation which are efficiently handled by
   introducing deterministic self-adaptive uncertainty model. The case
   study on a standard test distribution system being modified by wind
   turbines, photovoltaic generators and microturbines demonstrates the
   effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The results of study are

Abstract = {{A compact dual band-notched Ultra-wideband (UWB) circular monopole
   antenna that has two parasitic resonators in the ground plane is
   presented in this paper. The Inverted-U and Iron shaped parasitic
   resonators are located on the back side of the radiating patch to
   achieve the band rejection characteristics from 5 to 5.4 GHz for WLAN
   and 7.8 to 8.4 GHz for ITU band respectively. By cutting a rectangular
   slot on the ground plane, additional resonance is excited at the higher
   frequency band, and hence much wider impedance bandwidth can be
   attained. Applications of the proposed dual band-notched ultra-wideband
   (UWB) antenna structure with 5.2 GHz and 8.2 GHz center frequencies are
   demonstrated experimentally. Measured and simulated results of the
   magnitude of SH, radiation patterns and realized gains show good
   agreement.}},

Abstract = {{Handwritten character recognition is currently getting the attention of
   researchers because of possible applications in assisting technology for
   blind and visually impaired users, human-robot interaction, automatic
   data entry for business documents, etc. In this work, we propose a
   technique to recognize handwritten Devanagari characters using deep
   convolutional neural networks (DCNN) which are one of the recent
   techniques adopted from the deep learning community. We experimented the
   ISIDCHAR database provided by (Information Sharing Index) ISI, Kolkata
   and V2DMDCHAR database with six different architectures of DCNN to
   evaluate the performance and also investigate the use of six recently
   developed adaptive gradient methods. A layer-wise technique of DCNN has
   been employed that helped to achieve the highest recognition accuracy
   and also get a faster convergence rate. The results of
   layer-wise-trained DCNN are favorable in comparison with those achieved
   by a shallow technique of handcrafted features and standard DCNN.}},

Abstract = {{This study showcases the potential of unnatural amino acids to enable
   non-natural functions when incorporated in the protein scaffold of heme
   metalloproteins. For this purpose, a genetically-engineered myoglobin
   (Mb) mutant was created by incorporating redox-active 3-amino-L-tyrosine
   (NH(2)Tyr) into its active site, replacing the distal histidine (H64)
   with NH(2)Tyr. In peroxide-shunt assays, this variant exhibits an
   increased rate of turnover for thioanisole and benzaldehyde oxidation as
   compared to the wild-type (WT) Mb. Indeed, in the presence of excess
   hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a 9-fold and 81-fold increase in activity was
   observed over multiple turnovers for thioanisole sulfoxidation and
   benzoic acid formation, respectively. The increased oxidation activity
   in the H64NH(2)Tyr Mb mutant underlined the role of NH(2)Tyr in the
   distal active-site scaffold in peroxide activation. Kinetic,
   electrochemical, and EPR spectroscopic experiments were performed. On
   the basis of these studies, it is argued that the single NH(2)Tyr
   residue within the Mb variant simultaneously serves the role of the
   conserved His/Arg-pair within the distal pocket of horseradish
   peroxidase.}},

Abstract = {{Three dyes based on a triphenylamine (TPA) moiety using a silicon bridge
   have been synthesised, namely CL-1D, CL-OMe and CL-SiMe. Structural
   benefits of long alkyl chains and electron donor group on photo
   conversion efficiency (PCE) of dye sensitized solar cells is discussed.
   A previously synthesised dye, denoted CL-1, which contained long alkyl
   chains and exhibited an efficiency of 6.90\%, was compared with CL-SiMe,
   which contained shorter alkyl chains and showed and efficiency of
   3.41\%. A large drop in J(sc) and V-oc was found to be the reason for
   the appreciable decline in efficiency for CL-SiMe vis-a-vis CL-1.
   Electron donor group studies were performed using CL-1D and CL-OMe.
   CL-1D, which contained bulky aniline electron donor groups, showed an
   efficiency of 4.20\%, whilst CL-OMe, featuring smaller methoxy donor
   groups had an efficiency of 5.50\%. Theoretical UV-Vis absorption
   spectra were obtained for the CL-1D dye by time-dependent density
   functional theory (TD-DFT); the experimental and calculated values of
   the energy for maximum absorbance were in good agreement with
   experimental data.}},

Title = {{Dependence of enhanced biological nitrogen removal on carbon to nitrogen

   reactor}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{171}},

Abstract = {{Carbon to nitrogen ratio (C/N) is not the lone limiting factors in
   biological nutrient removal from municipal wastewaters, but readily
   biodegradable to slowly biodegradable COD ratio (rbCOD/sbCOD) inter alia
   governs the process of nutrient removal. An intermittent aeration
   pre-anoxic sequencing batch reactor was operated at C/N ratio of 3, 7.5,
   and 10 and at rbCOD/sbCOD ratios of 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5 at different
   sludge internal recirculation ratios. The increasing trend in nitrogen
   removal was observed with above mentioned operating parameters.
   At high C/N and rbCOD/sbCOD ratio of 10 and 0.5 the maximum total
   nitrogen (TN) removal was 90.7\% giving 3.8 mg/L TN in the effluent out
   of 30 mg/L in the influent. At average sewage quality consisting of C/N
   and rbCOD/sbCOD ratio of 7.5 and 0.25; the TN removal was not more than
   83\%. The specific nitrate removal rate varied from 0.010 to 0.022
   gNO(3)(-)/gVSSa.d (0.015 +/- 0.0013) at C/N ratio of 3.0, 0.013-0.018
   gNO(3)(-)/gVSSa.d (0.017 +/- 0.0011) at 7.5 and 0.013-0.015
   gNO(3)(-)/gVSSa.d (0.014 +/- 0.001) at 10. The increase in specific
   nitrate removal rate was coherent to high rbCOD/sbCOD ratio but as the
   C/N increased to 10 this effect was nullified. The result conformed to
   defined stoichiometric model based on C/N, rbCOD/sbCOD and sludge
   internal recirculation ratios. It will help in further effluent
   polishing with respect to nutrient removal to achieve desired treated
   wastewater quality. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Combined effects of thermal radiation and variable viscosity on a
   time-dependent boundary-layer flow of magnetic nanofluids over a
   rotating disk in the presence of the porous medium have been numerically
   investigated. To carry out the study, hydrocarbon based magnetic
   nanofluid containing magnetite Fe3O4 particles of 10 nm with magnetic
   phase concentration of 10\% has been taken. For numerical solutions of
   the modelled system containing the governing equation of the flow, a
   MATLAB tool ODE45 is employed with shooting technique for the initial
   guess of the unknown boundary conditions. The flow phenomenon and heat
   transfer on the plate surface are characterised by various flow
   parameters such as viscosity variations, unsteady rotation parameter,
   Prandtl number, and radiation parameter. Also, a comparative thermal
   analysis has been carried out for magnetic nanofluids having three
   different bases viz. hydrocarbon, fluorocarbon, and water. Results
   reveal that heat transfer rate of hydrocarbon base magnetic nanofluids
   is 73.4511\% faster than water base magnetic nanofluids, and 239.7458\%
   faster than fluorocarbon base magnetic nanofluids. This enhanced heat
   transfer capacity of hydrocarbon base magnetic nanofluids will help in
   improving the performance of oil and ore extraction drilling systems
   used in mining industry and other geothermal applications.}},

Abstract = {{Bitcoin is a popular cryptocurrency that records all transactions in a
   distributed append-only public ledger called blockchain. The security of
   Bitcoin heavily relies on the incentive-compatible proof-of-work (PoW)
   based distributed consensus protocol, which is run by the network nodes
   called miners. In exchange for the incentive, the miners are expected to
   maintain the blockchain honestly. Since its launch in 2009, Bitcoin
   economy has grown at an enormous rate, and it is now worth about 150
   billions of dollars. This exponential growth in the market value of
   bitcoins motivate adversaries to exploit weaknesses for profit, and
   researchers to discover new vulnerabilities in the system, propose
   countermeasures, and predict upcoming trends. In this paper, we present
   a systematic survey that covers the security and privacy aspects of
   Bitcoin. We start by giving an overview of the Bitcoin system and its
   major components along with their functionality and interactions within
   the system. We review the existing vulnerabilities in Bitcoin and its
   major underlying technologies such as blockchain and PoW-based consensus
   protocol. These vulnerabilities lead to the execution of various
   security threats to the standard functionality of Bitcoin. We then
   investigate the feasibility and robustness of the state-of-the-art
   security solutions. Additionally, we discuss the current anonymity
   considerations in Bitcoin and the privacy-related threats to Bitcoin
   users along with the analysis of the existing privacy-preserving
   solutions. Finally, we summarize the critical open challenges, and we
   suggest directions for future research towards provisioning stringent
   security and privacy solutions for Bitcoin.}},

Abstract = {{It is the intention of this work to develop a system which specialized
   in processing scanned images. This paper focuses on developing an
   extended partitioning approach for partial fingerprint identification.
   The procedure has utilized image orientation, enhancement,
   extended-partitioning, binarization and feature extraction. The major
   focus of this work is to reduce error rates during match. The proposed
   approach performs partitioning on images to create extended sub-parts
   before matching. This procedure clinically extracts the information of
   sub-parts and establishes a lower bound on the performance. The extended
   partition-based representation combines both the global and the local
   information present in a fingerprint Test results have presented that
   the proposed method has a discriminatory power compared to other
   representations. Finally, it has shown that the use of all the
   techniques presented in this work significantly improves error rates of
   a partial fingerprint identification system on a large database.}},

Abstract = {{Even though finding out distance is the central core of k-Nearest

   Most of the similarity measures, which are used to classify an instance,

   increases in the number of dimensions. This paper establishes an
   efficient technique called ARSkNN for finding out class of any given
   instance using a measure based on an unique similarity, that does no
   longer compute distance, for k-NN classification. Our empirical results
   show that ARSkNN classification technique is better than the previous
   established k-NN classifiers. The performance of algorithm was verified

Journal = {{AEU-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS AND COMMUNICATIONS}},

Pages = {{74-81}},
Abstract = {{Over recent years, cognitive radio technology has been paid enormous
   attention as this innovatory communication archetype can utilize
   existing wireless spectrum resources more competently. Spectrum sensing
   is considered to be primary and most essential task for cognitive radio
   network operators. It has been acknowledged that cooperative spectrum
   sensing improves the overall sensing performance of the network. But
   selfish users be likely to act greedily to access the channel without
   involving in spectrum sensing. In this paper, we considered multiuser
   de-centralized cooperative spectrum sensing scenario and game theory is
   used to analyze the cognitive interaction process. A comprehensive
   expression is derived for throughput and it is, then, maximized through
   strategic interaction between cognitive users. Simulation result shows
   that taking part in sensing is not always good in terms of throughput.
   This work also evaluates network conditions to determine when to
   contribute in sensing to maximize throughput.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTING AND INFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{311-326}},
Abstract = {{Concurrent workflow scheduling algorithm works in three phases, namely
   rank computation, tasks selection, and resource selection. In this
   paper, we introduce a new ranking algorithm that computes the rank of a
   task, based on its successor rank and its predecessors average
   communication time, instead of its successors rank. The advantage of
   this ranking algorithm is that two dependent tasks are assigned to the
   same machine and as a result the scheduled length is reduced. The task
   selection phase selects a ready task from each workflow and creates a
   task pool. The resource selection phase initially assigns tasks using
   min-min heuristic, after initial assignment, tasks are moved from the
   highly loaded machines to the lightly loaded machines. Our resource
   selection algorithm increases the load balance among the resources due
   to tasks assignment heuristic and reassignment of tasks from the highly
   loaded machines. The simulation results show that our proposed
   scheduling algorithm performs better over existing approaches in terms
   of load balance, makespan and turnaround time.}},

   almost uniform in entire UWB band. The size of the UWB MIMO antenna is
   0.31.lambda(at3.1) (GHz) x 0.434 lambda(at3.1) (GHz) x 0.008
   lambda(at3.1) (GHz) mm(3), and it is printed on an RT/duroid 5880
   substrate (epsilon(r) = 2.2, tan delta = 0.0009), which leads to good
   gain and high total efficiency of the antenna in operating bands. The
   simulated and measured results show good agreement for the impedance
   bandwidth (vertical bar S-11 vertical bar < -10 dB) and isolation
   (vertical bar S-21 vertical bar < -20 dB) in most of the operating band,
   excluding the notched band at 5.2 GHz in UWB range. The simulated,
   measured and calculated MIMO antenna diversity parameters prove that the
   antenna is suitable for UWB MIMO systems.}},

Title = {{ANALYSIS OF LED DRIVER TOPOLOGIES WITH RESPECT TO POWER FACTOR AND THD}},
Journal = {{LIGHT \& ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{63-72}},
Abstract = {{Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) are fast replacing incandescent lamps and
   CFLs in most of the developing nations. The reason can be attributed
   mainly to the enhanced lifetime and less energy consumption as compared
   to the other mentioned types. However one important aspect needs
   attention, the impact of driver on LEDs. LEDs are current controlled
   devices and hence emit maximum light with increase in current input to
   the device. This feature, boost up the light output but it increases the
   junction temperature of the device. Hence additional heat sinks are
   required to vent out the excessive heat generated due to increase
   current input to the LEDs. Those additional heat sinks are at times
   difficult to accommodate. So, designers have made arrangements to vent
   out the heat from the device. This is achieved by designing fins.
   However this arrangement is not suitable in places where the ambient
   temperature is more than normal. Thus, design of LED driver with
   controlled current input is essential in order to maintain the thermal
   limit of the device. Secondly, the AC-DC LEDs driver circuits, which are
   available in the market, are seldom equipped with input power factor and
   THD improvement circuitry as prescribed in IEC61000-3-2. This is
   essential for maintaining the energy efficiency of the nearest utility
   services and in addition also improves on the current drawn by the
   device. The following work envisages these issues and proposes
   corrective driver circuit based on two different driver topologies,
   buck-boost topology and flyback topology. Both these topologies are
   proposed in order to address the aspects of power quality and its impact
   on the life of the device. The simulation were done using Green Point
   simulation tool from On Semiconductors.}},

Abstract = {{This article analyzes the effect of abnormal environmental conditions on
   various reliability measures. After the continuous operation of
   single-unit systems for a long duration of time these systems cannot be
   restored again in a younger state after the failure of the system. The
   unit does not remain as new after repair. This phenomenon is known as
   degradation and the unit after repair is called degraded unit.
   Preventive maintenance is a proactive method to tackle and overcome from
   these types of problems. For this purpose, a stochastic model is
   developed for single-unit systems by using semi-Markov process. There is
   a single server who inspects the failed unit after failed to check the
   feasibility of repair and replacement. If repair is not feasible then
   unit is replaced with some replacement time. The failed unit after
   repair becomes degraded and degraded failed unit is replaced by new one.
   All time distributions are arbitrary distributed like Weibull
   distribution with common shape parameter and different scale parameters.
   The switching devices are instantaneous. The system is observed at
   suitable regenerative epochs to obtain various measures of system
   effectiveness of interest to system designers and operation managers.}},

Abstract = {{The flow characteristics of nanofluids flow driven by combined effects
   of electroosmosis and peristalsis are very important for designing
   bio-mimetic pumping systems at the micro scale of interest in
   physiological treatment e.g. ocular drug delivery systems. The flow
   characteristics of thermally developed nanofluids flow are investigated
   in presence of peristalsis and electroosmosis phenomena. Thermal
   radiation effect is also introduced. Tapered asymmetric microchannels
   are imposed at the walls to mimic sophisticated peristaltic wave
   propagation scenarios. The nanofluid is employed as the worldng fluid,
   and the analytical solution for electro-osmotic flow is obtained by
   virtue of the Debye-Huckel linearization. The dimensional conservation
   equations are linearized under lubrication theory approximations. The
   effects of emerging physical parameters namely Grashof numbers, Brownian
   motion parameter, thermophoresis parameter, Helmholtz-Smoluchowski
   velocity, Debye length and thermal radiation on flow characteristics,
   heat transfer characteristics, and pumping characteristics are computed.
   Furthermore, an inherent phenomenon of peristaltic pumping known as
   trapping is also presented graphically under the influence of pertinent
   parameters and discussed in brief. Validation of present model is also
   presented. This model is mainly applicable to study cell responses,
   blood analysis, biomimetic capillary designs, and blood vessel tissue
   culture systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A modified microbial polysaccharide based biopolymer has been
   investigated as a potential candidate towards development of sustainable
   biomaterials and bioplastics. An in-depth study was carried out to
   biosynthesize, characterize and assess any possible mutagenic potential
   and ecotoxicity of the microbial polysaccharide biopolymer.
   Microstructural investigations using confocal microscopy, Fourier
   transform (FT)-Raman depth profile mapping and scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM) of the biosynthetically modified polysaccharide
   revealed internal structural perturbations, as well as occlusion of
   granular pores by extraneous materials. The Raman 3D mapping depth
   profile along with time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry also
   indicated important structural and surface modifications, which could be
   correlated to the production of microbial exopolysaccharides and
   secondary metabolites. The study then looked into any possible genetic
   mutation and ecological risks associated with the biosynthetically
   modified polysaccharide through the investigation of genotoxicity and
   ecotoxicity. The genotoxicity study was carried out through bacterial
   reverse gene mutation (Ames) test by using two different strains (TA98
   and TA100) of bacteria. The results did not indicate any mutagenic
   effect against either of the strains used for the biopolymer samples and
   was found to be genotoxically safe. Ecotoxicity tests, carried out using
   bioluminescent bacteria Vibrio fisheri further indicated no ecotoxicity
   within the given experimental conditions. The study measured the half
   maximal effective concentration (EC50) to cause a 50\% decrease in the
   light output of the bacteria, a measure of ecotoxicological response of
   the biopolymer. Overall, results from this study indicated that the
   novel biopolymer was genotoxically and ecotoxically safe, which offers
   immense potential for future use of this biopolymer.}},

Abstract = {{Power system monitoring and control in real time is a challenging task
   for modern power system due to large operational constraints. The
   deployment of phasor measurement units (PMUs) at key locations provides
   an opportunity for devising effective power system monitoring and
   control measures. In this study, a new method is proposed to determine
   the real-time transient stability status and identification of the
   coherent generator groups by predicting the rotor angle values following
   a large disturbance through radial basis function neural network. The
   first six cycles of synchronously sampled post-fault data measurements
   from PMUs consisting of rotor angles and voltages of generators are
   taken as the input to the neural network to predict the future state of
   the system. The proposed method can also determine the synchronism state
   of the individual machine in real time. The proposed scheme is
   demonstrated on the IEEE-39 bus test system at different operating
   conditions.}},

Title = {{A benchmark study of automated intra-retinal cyst segmentation

Abstract = {{(Background and objectives): Retinal cysts are formed by accumulation of
   fluid in the retina caused by leakages from inflammation or vitreous
   fractures. Analysis of the retinal cystic spaces holds significance in
   detection and treatment of several ocular diseases like age-related
   macular degeneration, diabetic macular edema etc. Thus, segmentation of
   intra-retinal cysts and quantification of cystic spaces are vital for
   retinal pathology and severity detection. In the recent years, automated
   segmentation of intra-retinal cysts using optical coherence tomography
   B-scans has gained significant importance in the field of retinal image
   analysis. The objective of this paper is to compare different
   intra-retinal cyst segmentation algorithms for comparative analysis and
   benchmarking purposes.
   (Methods): In this work, we employ a modular approach for standardizing
   the different segmentation algorithms. Further, we analyze the
   variations in automated cyst segmentation performances and method
   scalability across image acquisition systems by using the publicly
   available cyst segmentation challenge dataset (OPTIMA cyst segmentation
   challenge).
   (Results): Several key automated methods are comparatively analyzed
   using quantitative and qualitative experiments. Our analysis
   demonstrates the significance of variations in signal-to-noise ratio
   (SNR), retinal layer morphology and post-processing steps on the
   automated cyst segmentation processes.
   (Conclusion): This benchmarking study provides insights towards the
   scalability of automated processes across vendor-specific imaging
   modalities to provide guidance for retinal pathology diagnostics and
   treatment processes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. Allrights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A series of multifunctional carbohydrazide based chromofluorescent
   sensor molecules derived from carbohydrazide, 4-formyl-1-substituted
   phenyl-pyrazole-3-carboxylate and 2-hydroxy-naphthaldehyde were
   successfully designed and synthesized. The synthesized sensor molecules
   exhibit significant red shift in their absorption spectra with visual
   color changes on interaction with Cu(II) and Zn(II) ions. In addition,
   the optimized sensor showed excellent selectivity towards Cu(II) and
   Zn(II) ions with fluorescence turn off and turn on modes respectively.
   Along with this, anion recognition studies were carried out using
   UV-visible and fluorescence spectrophotometric titrations which revealed
   that synthesized sensors also exhibit selective sensing of F-, CH3COO-
   and H2PO4- ions via H-bond interaction and subsequent deprotonation to
   elicit distinct visual color change from light yellow to orange with
   significant quenching in its emission intensity. Furthermore, the
   in-situ prepared sensor-anion adduct solution exhibited colorimetric

Abstract = {{Two-proton radioactivity with 2p halo is reported theoretically in light
   mass nuclei A = 18-34. We predict Mg-19, Si-22, S-26, Ar-30 and Ca-34 as

   S-p > 0. Observation of extended tail of spatial charge density
   distribution, larger charge radius and study of proton single particle
   states, Fermi energy and the wave functions indicate 2p halo like
   structure which supports direct 2p emission. The Coulomb and centrifugal
   barriers in experimentally identified 2p unbound Si-22 show a
   quasi-bound state that ensures enough life time for such experimental
   probes. Our predictions are in good accord with experimental and other

Abstract = {{This paper deals with unsteady oscillatory flow of viscous
   incompressible fluid with heat \& mass transfer in a horizontal channel
   partially occupied by porous medium following the Darcy-Brinkman model.
   The inner territory of the channel consists of two regions; one of them
   is filled with porous material and second is clear fluid. At the porous
   medium fluid interface, interfacial coupling conditions for the fluid
   velocity, temperature and concentration were used to derive the
   analytical solution. Some standard values of Schmidt number like
   Hydrogen(0.22), Helium(0.30), Amonia(0.78); Eckert number (0.25, 0.5, 1,
   2) and Prandtl number for water(0.71) and Air(7.0) was considered in
   this paper. The effects of pertinent physical fluid parameter like
   porosity, viscosity ratio, density ratio etc. on velocity, temperature
   and concentration distribution are considered and demonstrated through
   graphs. Heavier diffusive species and high molecular diffusivity ratio
   decreases the fluid concentration throughout the region. Increasing
   values of Prandtl number upsurge the fluid temperature throughout the
   region.}},

Abstract = {{Gangta Bet, situated between the Wagad Uplift and Khadir Island in the
   Kachchh Basin, is composed of Callovian to Oxfordian fossiliferous
   sedimentary rocks, in which brachiopods are an important component,
   especially in a local marker horizon (the Brachiopod Bed). In total, six
   taxa are discussed here: Bihendulirhynchia brevicostata, Kallirhynchia
   versabilis, Mycerosia rostellata, Somalithyris jhalarensis, and two
   Kutchithyris species, K euryptycha and K. ingluviosa. The genera
   Mycerosia and Bihendulirhynchia are new records from Kachchh and the
   occurring species have been previously known from the Middle to Upper
   Jurassic of Somalia, the Sinai Peninsula, Arabia, and the Northwest
   Frontier Province (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) of Pakistan. Somalithyris,
   previously recorded from the Tithonian of Kachchh, is also present in
   the Callovian-Oxfordian Gangta member. This is the oldest record of the
   genus globally and the presence of the same species in Kachchh and
   Pakistan is also significant. These new descriptions from Kachchh are
   therefore of high palaeobiogeographic importance as they strengthen the
   existence of free faunal exchange between Kachchh, East Africa and
   Arabia during the Callovian-Oxfordian, and reveal a midway position of
   the North West Frontier Province of Pakistan.}},
