Abstract = {{Designing of a type-II nanoscale heterostructure and simulating their
   optical properties is critical for many applications and remains a
   challenge. This paper reports designing of a complex type-II `W' shaped
   symmetric InGaAsP/GaAsSb nano-scale heterostructure grown on InP
   substrate and mechanism of the transitions taking place within the
   heterostructure which are responsible for optical properties. In
   addition, the band alignment, optical gain and lasing wavelength are
   also studied under the effect of applied external electric field ranging
   from 10 to 200 kV/cm and variable temperature. On the basis of outcome
   of the calculations, the proposed heterostructure can be claimed to show
   a very high optical gain (similar to 8000/cm) within the MIR (mid
   infrared) region. Moreover, the results achieved in the study suggest
   that the application of the both variable temperature and applied
   external electric field on the heterostructure can control the optical
   gain as well as lasing wavelength linearly. Due to the linear behavior
   of the proposed heterostructure, the tunable type-II InGaAsP/GaAsSb
   nano-scale heterostructure can be claimed as a very suitable
   heterostructure for the designing of photovoltaic devices operating in
   the IR region. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this research study, empirical mathematical models for cutting forces
   and surface roughness have been developed to investigate the effect of
   axial depth of cut, feed, radial depth of cut and cutting speed in
   high-speed ball-end milling of Al2014-T6. Ball-end milling experiments
   have been planned using central composite design based on response
   surface methodology. The mathematical models have been established and
   tested for adequacy. A full quadratic model has been adopted for
   modelling. It has been found that axial depth of cut is the most
   dominant cutting parameter for the tangential and axial cutting forces,
   accounting for 49.38 and 47.12\% contributions, respectively. Radial
   depth of cut is the most dominant parameter for radial force and
   contributes 69.94\% for it. Results also revealed that force components
   decrease with increase in cutting speed. There is very small variation
   in cutting force components in the cutting speed range of 75-150 m/min
   at lower values of axial and radial depth of cut. Surface roughness is
   effected by cutting speed largely followed by feed. Multi-objective
   optimization has been performed using composite desirability to optimize
   the cutting parameters for minimum surface roughness and cutting forces
   simultaneously. Confirmation tests have been conducted using optimal set
   of cutting parameters. The results of confirmation tests are very close
   to the predicted results.}},

Title = {{INBREEDED GA FOR OPTIMAL DR ALLOCATION IN DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING-JOE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Although the phenomenon of inbreeding is quite usual in animals, but has
   not been yet attempted to enhance the performance of genetic algorithms
   (GAs). The crossover operator of GA can be modified using the concept of
   inbreeding in animals. This single measure enhances the pace of GA.
   However, GA stagnates due to inbreeding, as in animals, which is then
   overcome by suggesting mandatory mutation in addition to the
   conventional mutation. This paper proposes inbreeded GA (IGA) which is
   then applied to efficiently solve the simultaneous optimal allocation of
   shunt capacitors and distributed generations in distribution systems
   while considering realities of practical distribution systems. The
   objective considered is to maximize annual energy loss reduction. The
   proposed method is applied on the benchmark IEEE 33-bus test
   distribution system. The application results obtained shows the
   supremacy of IGA over GA and other existing metaheuristics.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports structural, electrical, and gas sensing
   characteristics of n-ZnO/p-Si heterojunction diodes fabricated using RF
   sputtering technique. The microstructural and surface morphological
   properties have been studied using X-ray diffraction, atomic force
   microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy, respectively. The
   electrical properties of the fabricated diodes have been investigated
   using current-voltage (I-V) and capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements.
   The estimated values for rectification ratio, ideality factor, and
   barrier height were found to be similar to 100, 3.27, and 0.72eV,
   respectively, at room temperature. The values recorded for carrier
   concentration and barrier height using C-V measurement were 3.82 x
   10(14) cm(-3) and 0.79 eV, respectively. The value of series resistance
   using Chueng's function was found to be 1710 Omega. After detailed
   structural and electrical characterization, methanol sensing response
   (3-100 ppm) of n-ZnO/p-Si heterojunction diodes for the temperature
   range of 27 degrees C-150 degrees C have also been investigated. The
   optimum operating temperature for methanol sensing was found to be
   considerably low, i.e., 100 degrees C. The values of response magnitude,
   response time and recovery time at 100 degrees C were estimated as 82\%,
   similar to 4 and similar to 7 s, respectively. The cross sensitivity
   study for the nearest interfering species, such as ethanol, 1-propanol,
   butanol, butanone, and benzene, has confirmed the high selectivity of
   n-ZnO/p-Si heterojunction diodes for methanol sensing.}},

Abstract = {{A theoretical study is presented here for the electro-osmosis modulated
   peristaltic three-layered capillary flow of viscous fluids with
   different viscosities in the layers. The layers considered here are the
   core layer, the intermediate layer and the peripheral layer. The
   analysis has been carried out under a number of physical restrictions
   viz. Debye-Hfickel linearization (i.e. wall zeta potential <= 25 mV) is
   assumed sufficiently small, thin electric double layer limit (i.e. the
   peripheral layer is much thicker than the electric double layer
   thickness), low Reynolds number and large wavelength approximations. A
   non-dimensional analysis is used to linearize the boundary value
   problem. Fluid-fluid interfaces. peristaltic pumping characteristics,
   and trapping phenomenon are simulated. Present study also evaluates the
   responses of interface, pressure rise, time-averaged volume flow rate,
   maximum pressure rise, and the influence of Helmholtz-Smoluchowski
   velocity on the mechanical efficiency (with two different cases of the
   viscosity of fluids between the intermediate and the peripheral layer).
   Trapping phenomenon along with bolus dynamics evolution with thin EDL
   effects are analyzed. The findings of this study may ultimately be
   useful to control the microvascular flow during the fractionation of
   blood into plasma (in the peripheral layer), buffy coat (intermediate
   layer) and erythrocytes (core layer). This work may also contributes in
   electrophoresis, hematology, electrohydrodynamic therapy and, design and
   development of biomimetic electro-osmotic pumps. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

   emerge as doubly magic with N = 16 in accord with the recent experiments
   and S-26 emerges as a new proton magic nucleus with Z = 16. N = 14 and Z

Abstract = {{Automobile emissions are the main source of greenhouse gases (GHG)
   accumulation in environment. As old engines (Euro III or earlier)
   produce more emissions and it will be difficult to entirely stop their
   usage especially in developing and underdeveloped nations, it is desired
   that appropriate emission reduction technologies are tested on such
   engines to analyze their feasibility and economical acceptability. While
   most such studies have been conducted on constant speed stationary
   engines and modern engines, this study tried to analyze the
   effectiveness of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system on a Euro-1,
   water-cooled, direct injection, variable speed, compression ignition
   (C.I.) engine in a laboratory setup in India. This was done by testing
   an electronic control unit (ECU)-controlled EGR valve running the engine
   on different speeds; with different torques, as also with varying EGR
   percentages. Then optimum value of EGR valve opening for each set of
   engine speed and torque was determined, that is, corresponding to
   minimum oxides of nitrogen (NOx). Optimum EGR valve position was
   programmatically fed, for each set of torque and engine speed (in RPM),
   into EGR ECU and then the engine was run at varying speeds and torques
   and the emissions were verified in the automated mode. It was found that
   using EGR, NOx emissions were substantially reduced (average 45\%
   reduction), without significantly impacting the engine performance.
   However, smoke emission increased with EGR. In order to counter the
   adverse effects, additional emission reduction technologies should be
   used in tandem with EGR. (c) 2017 American Institute of Chemical

Abstract = {{Quaternary and ternary alloy semiconductors offer an extra degree of
   flexibility in terms of bandgap tuning. Modifications in the wave
   functions and alterations in optical transitions in quaternary and
   ternary QW (quantum well) heterostructures due to external uniaxial
   strain provide valuable insights on the characteristics of the
   heterostructure. This paper reports the optical gain in strained
   InGaAsP/GaAsSb type-II QW heterostructure (well width = 20 angstrom)
   under external uniaxial strain at room temperature (300 K). The entire
   heterostructure is supposed to be grown on InP substrate
   pseudomorphically. Band structure, wave functions, energy dispersion and
   momentum matrix elements of the heterostructure have been computed. 6 x
   6 diagonalised (k) over right arrow . (p) over right arrow Hamiltonian
   matrix of the system is evaluated and Luttinger-Kohn model has been
   applied for the band structure and wavefunction calculations. TE mode
   optical gain spectrum in the QW-heterostructure under uniaxial strain
   along {[}110] is calculated. Optical gain of the heterostructure as a
   function of 2D carrier density and temperature variation is
   investigated. The variation of the peak optical gain as a function of As
   and Sb fractions in InGaAsP as a barrier and GaAsSb as a well
   respectively is exhibited. For a charge carrier injection of 5 x
   10(12)/cm(2), the TE optical gain is 3952 cm(-1) at room temperature
   under no external uniaxial strain. Significant increase in TE mode
   optical gain is observed under high external uniaxial strain (1, 5 and
   10 GPa) along {[}110] within IR (Infrared region) region. (C) 2017

Title = {{Variability aware transistor stack based regression surrogate models for
   accurate and efficient statistical leakage estimation}},
Journal = {{MICROELECTRONICS JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{69}},
Pages = {{1-19}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we present highly accurate and very efficient stack based
   surrogate models for standby (idle-time) statistical leakage estimation
   of CMOS circuits using sampling based methods. Our aim is to replace
   SPICE simulation with our proposed surrogate models, which can be used
   to evaluate samples generated by sampling methods in variation space.
   Our methodology initiates by first characterizing the leakage of basic
   transistor stacks and then provides estimate of the leakage of basic
   gates based on these stacks. Transistor stacks are extracted across
   various standard cells, which are used to estimate leakage of CMOS gates
   with different input vector combinations. We develop Support Vector
   Machine (SVM) regression surrogate models and characterize the
   transistor stacks of CMOS gates, while accounting the combined effect of
   process variations in transistor length (L), threshold voltage (V-th),
   oxide thickness (T-ox), supply voltage (0.6V - 1.2V), temperature (0
   degrees C-100 degrees C) and width (28nm - 200nm), all scalable at the
   same time. For gates containing parallel transistor stacks, we merge the
   parallel transistors having identical inputs, which in turn allows us to
   use precharacterized basic stacks for leakage calculation, thus avoiding
   generation of new models. Our experiments illustrate that we only
   require 30 and 26 stack models to predict the subthreshold and gate
   tunneling leakage of 20 different gates across 176 input combinations,
   instead of characterizing leakage model for each input vector
   separately. SVM regression models generated in our approach have the
   ability to predict the leakage with maximum average error of 2.7\% in
   mean (mu) and maximum average error of 3.1\% in standard deviation
   (sigma), both for OAI22 gate. Our results establish that there is on an
   average 10x improvement in runtime while estimating the mu and sigma of
   leakage of a gate within 10000 Monte Carlo simulation loop. Our
   approaches also result into a maximum of 221x runtime improvement for
   C6288 ISCAS' 85 benchmark circuit. We further develop Sparse SVM models
   using Support Vector spectrum pruning method, which reduces the runtime
   of the regression models with negligible increase in the error. Runtime
   efficiency of 17x and 323x is achieved on standard cell library and
   C6288 benchmark circuit respectively using Sparse SVM models. Our models
   outperform previous models based on analytical equations and Artificial
   Neural Network in terms of accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{This paper predict the effect of the object's morphology on the final
   accuracy of the scanned data, for the case of contactless laser
   scanning. On the basis of the scanned objects morphology, two important
   process parameters are specified namely scanning angle and distance of
   the laser from the part surface. Experiments have been performed with
   different scanning conditions using full factorial design. An analytical
   prediction model for determining the standard deviation of the final
   surface is developed in terms of the aforesaid scanning parameters using
   response surface methodology (RSM). Furthermore, the optimal scanning
   parameters are predicted after comparing two almost unexplored nature
   inspired algorithms i.e. Whale Optimization Algorithm(WOA) andMoth-Flame
   Optimization (MFO). Finally, two realistic non-trivial case studies are
   considered for validation of the proposed methodology. The result shows
   that the standard deviation of the final reverse engineered models
   significantly reduced by 21.6\% and 13.77\%. The adopted methodology
   provides the optimal combination of morphological scanning process
   parameters with a considerable reduction in standard deviation for final

Abstract = {{The study of bimetallic nanoalloy clusters is of immense importance due

   compound formed between Ag and Au has received a lot of attention
   because of their marked electronic, catalytic, optical and magnetic

   successful approaches of quantum mechanics to study the electronic
   properties of materials. Conceptual DFT-based descriptors have turned to
   be indispensable tools for analysing and correlating the experimental
   properties of compounds. In this report, we have investigated the ground
   state configurations and physico-chemical properties of Ag2AuN lambda (N
   = 1-7, lambda=+/- 1, 0) nanoalloy clusters invoking DFT methodology. Our
   computed data exhibits interesting odd-even oscillation behaviour. A

Abstract = {{A spectacularly exposed slump is described from a 120-m-long road cut

   Basin of Rajasthan, India. The Upper Jurassic part of the sediments at
   the outcrop was formed in a near-shore setting and belongs to the
   Ludharwa Member of the Baisakhi Formation. The 3-m-thick unit shows a
   number of asymmetric folds and thrust faults leading to an imbrication
   of partly lithified sandstone beds. The deformation structures allow the
   reconstruction of a movement towards the northwest. This agrees well
   with the basin configuration that shows a deepening into this direction.
   Although the determination of a specific trigger mechanism is difficult
   for soft-sediment deformation structures, an earthquake caused by
   synsedimentary tectonics in the basin seems to be the most likely

Abstract = {{Load management of resources during high load demand managed by load
   management mechanism. An efficacious resource management algorithm
   effectively manages the load imbalance. Virtual Machine (VM) migration
   policy can maximize the throughput of the Cloud. Overloaded User Base
   (UB) high resource request increases the waiting time of the task and
   decreases the throughput. Task migration from high loaded VM to low
   loaded VM help to decrease the queue size and increase the throughput of
   the system. Effective resource management mechanism improves the
   performance and reduces the service level agreement (SLA) violations.
   Although researchers did the lot of work to manage load imbalance, but
   still need improvement. In this paper, proposed Dynamic weighted Live
   Migration (DWLM) Load balancing algorithm to manage the load imbalance
   problem. The proposed experiment result compares with another two
   algorithms. DWLM gives the better experiment results in Throughput,
   Migration time, Scalability and Fault Tolerance matrices.}},

Volume = {{184}},

Abstract = {{Sludge reduction by physico-chemical methods results in the buildup of
   chemicals, which may require further treatment. Owing these reasons
   various biologically sustainable methods of sludge reduction including
   the application of high oxygenation have been successfully tested.
   Experiments on actual sewage in two lab-scale sequencing batch reactors
   (SBRs) were conducted under normal (1.5-2.5 mgDO/L) and high dissolved
   oxygen (DO) (HDO: 3-6.5 mgDO/L) regimes. It was observed that
   microorganism allocated substrate between maintenance and growth in the
   form of maintenance coefficient. Which could be induced by endogenous
   respiration owing to high solids retention time (SRT), predation on
   bacteria, chemical toxicity, adverse environment, and viral attack on
   bacteria. The wastewater treatment process may experience one or more
   maintenance inducing factors; nevertheless, high SRT and prevailing
   environmental conditions are imminent and thus considered as primary
   maintenance (m(p)), while remaining are classified as secondary
   maintenance (m(s)). Average yield coefficient reduction at HDO was
   32.7\% and 28.2\% compared to stoichiometric and at normal DO,
   respectively. The observed primary and secondary maintenance was
   0.11gCOD/gVSS.d (+/- 0.01) at an SRT of 25.2 d (+/- 2.0) and 0.096 g 0.1
   gCOD/gVSS.d (+/- 0.045) at an SRT of 24.2 d (+/- 3.6d), respectively.
   The results obtained under the study are not as precise as on pure
   culture and defined substrate, nevertheless, it gives an idea that how
   stress factors inducing maintenance need to be addressed more seriously
   and objectively while managing our efforts on sludge reduction. (C) 2017

Title = {{A review on finite element method for machining of composite materials}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{176}},
Pages = {{790-802}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Composite materials are being extensively used in aerospace and
   automotive industry. The demand for composite materials is increasing
   due to their superior properties such as high strength to weight ratio,
   good corrosion resistance and high stiffness. Post machining operations
   such as drilling, orthogonal cutting, turning are necessary for
   composite materials to meet the dimensional and functional requirements.
   Drilling is a major process in manufacturing of holes, required for
   assembling the components in industrial applications. Drilling of holes
   in composites leads to a drilling-induced damage called delamination.
   The researchers have tried to reduce the drilling-induced damage by
   minimizing the operating variables and tool design. However, the
   research on delamination analysis using finite element method (FEM) is
   limited. This paper provides a comprehensive literature review on
   machining of composites which mainly focuses on conventional methods
   like turning, milling, trimming and drilling and also on simulation
   methods including discrete element method and finite element method. A
   brief and in depth review for drilling of composites using finite
   element method is delivered, which provides a knowledge on damage of the
   composites caused during drilling and orthogonal cutting. Comparison of
   experimental and simulation results shows an overall vision on machining
   of CFRP using FEM tools. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Mycosporine-like amino acids are the most common group of transparent
   ultraviolet radiation absorbing intracellular secondary metabolites.
   These molecules absorb light in the range of ultraviolet-A and -B with a

   the most deleterious ultraviolet radiation, which leads to an evolution
   of ultraviolet protecting mycosporine-like amino acids for efficient
   selection in the environment. In the last 30 years, scientists have
   investigated various cyanobacteria for novel mycosporine-like amino
   acids, applying different induction techniques. This review organizes
   all the cyanobacterial groups that produce various mycosporine-like
   amino acids. We found out that cyanobacteria belonging to orders
   Synechococcales, Chroococcales, Oscillatoriales, and Nostocales are
   frequently studied for the presence of mycosporine-like amino acids,
   while orders Gloeobacterales, Spirulinales, Pleurocapsales, and
   Chroococcidiopsidales are still need to be investigated. Nostoc and

Abstract = {{This paper deals with a problem where the effect of variable magnetic
   field and chemical reaction on free convective flow of an electrically
   conducting incompressible water based nanofluid over an exponentially
   stretching sheet has been investigated. In the present study, Buongiorno
   model associated with Brownian motion and thermophoretic diffusion is
   employed to describe the heat transfer enhancement of nanofluids. Some
   suitable similarity transformations reduced the governing boundary layer
   non-linear partial differential equations into a set of ordinary
   non-linear differential equations. The transformed equations are then
   solved numerically using fourth order Runga-Kutta method along with
   Shooting technique. The major outcomes of the present study is that the
   magnetic field impedes the fluid motion while thermal as well as mass
   buoyancy forces accelerate it, the thermophoretic diffusion enhances
   dimensionless fluid temperature as well as concentration leading to
   thicker thermal and concentration boundary layers. On the other hand,
   concentration exponent, Brownian motion parameter and chemical reaction
   parameter exhibit reverse trend on temperature and concentration. In
   addition, the presence of magnetic field under the influence of thermal
   as well as mass buoyancies supports to reduce the rate of heat transfer
   as well as wall shear stress while the first order chemical reaction
   develops a thinner concentration boundary layer. (C) 2017 The Society of

Abstract = {{Reactions of aluminium(III) iso-propoxide with acetoxime in anhydrous
   benzene yielded complexes of the type
   {[}Al((OPr)-Pr-i)(3-n)(ONC(CH3)(2))(n)], where n =1, 2 or 3. These
   complexes were characterized by elemental analysis, FTIR and NMR (H-1,
   C-13, Al-27) spectral studies. Spectral studies of these complexes
   suggest the presence of bi-dentate mode of the oximato moieties in the
   solution state. Soft transformations of aluminium(III) iso-propoxide and
   their oxime derivatives to pure alumina were carried out by the sol-gel
   technique. The powder XRD patterns of all the formed alumina suggest
   formation of cubic phase (y-alumina) with average crystallites size of
   7-30 nm. Optically transparent crack free alumina film was deposited on
   glass substrate using alumina sol, prepared by complex
   {[}Al((OPr)-Pr-i)(3-n)(ONC(CH3)(2)\}], through dip coating method. The
   film sintered at 500 degrees C is amorphous in nature as indicated by
   XRD study. The alumina film is found to be.-95\% optically transparent
   in the visible region..The observed particle size distribution of
   alumina thin film in AFM images is found to be 13 +/- 2 nm. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{Among several bimetallic nanoclusters, the compounds formed between
   Cu-Au have gained immense importance due to its remarkable optical,

   Theory (DFT) is one of the most successful and popular approaches of

   Conceptual DFT based descriptors have become indispensable tools for
   analyzing and correlating the experimental properties of compounds. In
   this venture, we have successfully investigated the physico-chemical
   properties of Au doped Cu nano-clusters invoking DFT methodology. Our
   results reveal that computed HOMO-LUMO gap of CunAu (n=1-7) nanoalloy
   clusters show pronounced even-odd alternation behavior. A close

   obstructions in neuroinflammatory treatments is the hindrance posed by
   the blood-brain barrier for the delivery of drugs. Hence, research has
   focused on novel modes of transport for drugs to cross the barrier

   the soil fungi Penicillium chrysogenum strain Fungal germplasm
   collection centre/ BLS1 was isolated, characterized and explored to
   synthesize extracellular silver NPs (AgNPs) under optimised conditions.
   The synthesis of AgNPs was investigated using ultraviolet (UV)-visible
   spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR),
   transmission electron microscope (TEM) and dynamic light scattering
   (DLS) analysis. Process optimisation exhibited AgNPs synthesis within 8
   h using 2 mM AgNO3 at pH 11 and temperature 70 degrees C. TEM analysis
   revealed polydispersed ellipsoidal shaped AgNPs with average particle
   size 96.8 nm as measured by DLS. AgNPs showed negative zeta potential
   that confers surface stability in solution. FTIR spectra confirmed the
   presence of protein bound to AgNPs. Antibacterial activity against
   Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus by the
   AgNPs (100 ppm) was demonstrated by counting colony forming unit , disc
   diffusion, and growth kinetics assay. Additionally radial assay revealed
   antifungal activity of AgNPs (100 ppm) against phytopathogenic fungi
   Sclerotinia sclerotiorum Microbial type culture collection 8785.
   Furthermore, AgNPs (100 ppm) did not show any cytotoxic effects on human
   Red blood cells. Therefore, this novel fungal strain can be utilised for
   biofabrication of AgNPs under optimised conditions and have shown strong
   antimicrobial property.}},

   synthesized by the reactions of {[}V(NPh)(O (i) Pr)(3)] (A) with
   2-acetylfuryl oxime in different molar ratios in anhydrous benzene. All
   these new derivatives have been characterized by elemental analyses,
   Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance
   (H-1, C-13 \{H-1\}), V-51) and fast atom bombardment mass spectral
   studies. Spectral studies appear to be indicating mono-dentate and

   and solid state, respectively. Fast atom bombardment mass study of one
   of the representative derivative, {[}V(NPh)\{(ONC)(CH3)(C4H3O-2)\}(3)]
   (3) suggests the monomeric nature of all these complexes.
   Thermogravimetric curve of {[}V(NPh)\{(ONC)(CH3)(C4H3O-2)\}(3)] (3)

   in (vn) is confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and
   nuclear magnetic resonance spectral studies as well as by the
   thermogravimetric study. The X-ray diffraction patterns of vanadia, (a)

   electron microscope images of (a) and (b) show rod like morphology of
   the crystallites. Absorption spectra of vanadia, (a) and (b) indicate
   energy band gaps of 2.62 and 2.43 eV, respectively.

Abstract = {{The present article studies theoretically the electrokinetic pumping of
   nanofluids with heat and mass transfer in a micro-channel under
   peristaltic waves, a topic of some interest in medical nano-scale
   electro-osmotic devices. The microchannel walls are deformable and
   transmit periodic waves. The Chakraborty-Roy nanofluid electrokinetic
   formulation is adopted in which Joule heating effects are incorporated.
   Soret and Dufour cross-diffusion effects are also considered. Under low
   Reynolds number (negligible inertial effects), long wavelength and Debye
   linearization approximations, the governing partial differential
   equations for mass, momentum, energy and solute concentration
   conservation are derived with appropriate boundary conditions at the
   micro-channel walls. The merging model features a number of important
   thermo-physical, electrical and nanoscale parameter, namely thermal and
   solutal Grashof numbers, the Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity (maximum
   electro-osmotic velocity) and Joule heating to surface heat flux ratio.
   Closed-form solutions are derived for the solute concentration,
   temperature, axial velocity, averaged volumetric flow rate, pressure
   difference across one wavelength, and stream function distribution in
   the wave frame. Additionally expressions are presented for the surface
   shear stress function at the wall (skin friction coefficient), wall heat
   transfer rate (Nusselt number) and wall solute mass transfer rate
   (Sherwood number). The influence of selected parameters on these flow
   variables is studied with the aid of graphs. Bolus formation is also
   visualized and analyzed in detail. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Predicting the functional consequences of non-synonymous single
   nucleotide polymorphisms in IL8 gene}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 26}},
Abstract = {{Here we report an in-silico approach for identification,
   characterization and validation of deleterious non-synonymous SNPs
   (nsSNPs) in the interleukin-8 gene using three steps. In first step,
   sequence homology-based genetic analysis of a set of 50 coding SNPs
   associated with 41 rsIDs using SIFT (Sorting Intolerant from Tolerant)
   and PROVEAN (Protein Variation Effect Analyzer) identified 23 nsSNPs to
   be putatively damaging/deleterious in at least one of the two tools
   used. Subsequently, structure-homology based PolyPhen-2 (Polymorphism
   Phenotyping) analysis predicted 9 of 23 nsSNPs (K4T, E31A, E31K, S41Y,
   I55N, P59L, P59S, L70P and V88D) to be damaging. According to the
   conditional hypothesis for the study, only nsSNPs that score
   damaging/deleterious prediction in both sequence and structural
   homology-based approach will be considered as `high-confidence' nsSNPs.
   In step 2, based on conservation of amino acid residues, stability
   analysis, structural superimposition, RSMD and docking analysis, the
   possible structural-functional relationship was ascertained for
   high-confidence nsSNPs. Finally, in a separate analysis (step 3), the
   IL-8 deregulation has also appeared to be an important prognostic marker
   for detection of patients with gastric and lung cancer. This study, for
   the first time, provided in-depth insights on the effects of amino acid
   substitutions on IL-8 protein structure, function and disease
   association.}},

Abstract = {{The present numerical simulations are carried out to investigate the
   effect of viscous dissipation, temperature dependent viscosity and heat
   source/sink on magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) unsteady Carreaue nanofluid
   over a cone filled with different alloy nanoparticles. We considered two
   different types of alloy nanoparticle namely nickel chromium iron alloy
   (Nimonic 80A) and titanium aluminum vanadium alloy (Ti\%6Al\%4V). The
   governing equations of the flow are solved using the Runge-Kutta and
   Newton's method. The present numerical results are compared with the
   previous study and found agreement with the uncertainty of +/- 2.5\%.
   Effects of various non dimensional parameters such as Eckert number,
   power index parameter, volume fraction, heat source/sink parameter,
   viscous variation parameter and semi-vertical angle of the cone on the
   momentum and thermal boundary layer including the friction factor
   coefficients and local Nusselt number are presented and analyzed for two
   different alloy considered in the present study. It is found that the
   viscous variation parameter enables to enhance the heat transfer rate.
   The Ti\%6Al\%4V alloy has higher friction factor coefficient along the
   azimuthal direction of the flow while Nimonic 80A alloy boosts up the
   friction coefficient along the tangential direction. It is worth to
   mention that the heat transfer rate of Nimonic 80A alloy is higher than
   that of Ti\%6Al\%4V alloy. Hence, Nimonic 80A alloy signifies a better
   thermal performance than the Ti\%6Al\%4V alloy. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{This paper presents a mathematical model for simulating viscous,
   incompressible, steady-state blood flow containing copper nanoparticles
   and coupled heat transfer through a composite stenosed artery with

   formulation is employed for the flowing blood. The equations governing
   the transport phenomena are non-dimensionalized and the resulting
   boundary value problem is solved analytically in the steady state

   computations are conducted to quantify the effects of relevant
   hemodynamic, thermophysical and nanoscale parameters emerging in the
   model on velocity and temperature profiles, wall shear stress, impedance
   resistance and also streamline distributions. The model may be

Abstract = {{Background and objectives: This paper aims to investigate the unsteady
   flow of two types of nanofluids i.e Copper water nanofluids and Silver
   water nanofluids) through finite length non-uniform channel driven by
   peristaltic sinusoidal wave propagations.
   Methods: The governing equations are reduced in linear form using
   dimensional analysis and considering the low Reynolds number and large
   wavelength approximations. The time dependent temperature field, axial
   velocity, transverse velocity and pressure difference are obtained
   analytically in closed form solution. Trapping phenomenon is also
   discussed with the help of contour plots of stream function. A
   comparative study of pure water (Newtonian fluid), Copper water
   nanofluids and Silver water nanofluids under the influence of relevant
   physical parameters is made in graphical form and also discussed. The
   effects of absorption parameter and Grashof number on velocity profiles,
   temperature profiles and pressure distribution along the length of
   channel are examined.
   Results conclusions: The computational results reveal that the velocity
   profile is maximum for Silver water nanofluids however, it is least for
   Copper water nanofluids. It is also concluded the temperature profile is
   more for pure water in comparison to Silver water and Copper water
   nanofluids. This model is applicable to design, micro-peristaltic pumps
   which help in Nanoparticle-based targeted drug delivery and to transport
   the sensitive or corrosive fluids, sanitary fluids, slurries and noxious
   fluids in nuclear industry. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focusses on the electronic and optical properties of
   scandium-based silver delafossite (AgScO2) semiconductor. The density
   functional theory (DFT) in the framework of full potential linearized
   augmented plane wave (FP-LAPW) scheme has been used for the present

   gradient approximation (GGA). Electronic properties deal with energy
   bands and density of states (DOSs), while optical properties describe
   refractive index and absorption coefficient. The energy bands are
   interpreted in terms of DOSs. The computed value of band gap is in
   agreement with that reported in the literature. Our results predict
   AgScO2 as indirect band-gap semiconductor. Our calculated value of the
   refractive index in zero frequency limits is 2.42. The absorption
   coefficient predicts the applicability of AgScO2 in solar cells and flat

Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{The poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) polymer blend films were prepared
   by solution casting method with varying PolyChloroTriFluoroEthylene
   (PCTFE) concentrations (1-5 wt \%). The crystallinity, bonding behavior
   and disorder in the films were investigated with X-ray diffraction
   (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), UV-visible and ellipsometry
   techniques, while surface morphology was studied using Atomic force
   microscopy (AFM). The nanocrystalline nature of PMMA is seen to be
   preserved in the blends although there are clear indications of bond
   modifications. The addition of PCTFE results in the improvement of
   overall crystallinity of the films via the interaction among PMMA and
   degraded PCTFE molecules when the films are casted from diluted
   solutions. In agreement, corresponding disorder in terms of Urbach
   energy shows a decreasing trend upon inclusion of more and more PCTFE
   molecules. Micro-Raman spectra are dominated by fluorescence background,
   which is proposed as arising from degraded PCTFE. Supporting this, FOR
   spectra also shows modifications in bonding as a function of PCTFE
   percentage, but this bond modification is not enough to produce
   refractive index variation in the sample, which is dominated by the host
   PMMA contribution for all the PCTFE concentrations. The study suggests
   the useful range of PCTFE concentration in which PMMA host properties
   can be modified for optimizing optical and structural properties without
   much degradation of PCTFE. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{POWDER TECHNOLOGY}},

Volume = {{315}},
Pages = {{205-215}},
Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{This paper mainly focuses on the influence of transverse magnetic field
   as well as thermal radiation on threedimensional free convective flow of
   nanofluid over a linear stretching sheet. One remarkable aspect of this
   study is that a new micro-convection model namely Patel model has been
   introduced in view of enhancement of thermal conductivity and hence more
   heat transfer capability of nanofluid. The non-linear partial
   differential equations have been converted into strong non-linear
   ordinary differential equations by employing suitable transformations
   and these transformed equations are solved by Runga-Kutta method of
   fourth order along with Shooting technique as well as Secant method for
   better approximation. From this study, it is found that the presence of
   magnetic field slows down the fluid motion while it enhances the fluid
   temperature leading to a reduction in heat transfer rate from the
   surface. It is also found that enhancing thermal radiation parameter
   causes a reduction in heat transfer rate. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to study the Bodewadt flow of a magnetic
   nanofluid in the presence of geothermal viscosity. The effects of
   porosity on an unsteady boundary layer flow of water-based magnetic
   nanofluids over a uniformly heated stationary disk are discussed
   numerically. Fluid viscosity is considered as a function of both depth
   and temperature. The Runge-Kutta fourth-order method along with the
   shooting technique is employed for solving a set of coupled ordinary
   differential equations. The computed results reveal that heat transfer
   is appreciably enhanced with more porosity and rotation of the fluid.
   Also, varying the fluids Prandtl number from 20 to 80, the rate of heat
   transfer increases by 93.35\% and faster cooling of the system occurs.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study is to investieate the effect of fiber orientation
   and ply stacking sequence of basalt-carbon hybrid composite laminates on
   the critical buckling strength, experimentally and by using nonlinear
   finite element analysis. The composite laminated plates are simply
   supported and subjected to axial compression load. Nonlinear FEA results
   using ANSYS have good agreement with the experimental results. FEA
   results showed that the outer layers have the most significant influence
   on the buckling strength of the composite laminated material.
   Furthermore, placing carbon fiber reinforced layers in the outer surface
   of the basalt-carbon/epoxy hybrid laminates results in significant
   increase in the critical buckling load compared to placing basalt fiber
   reinforced layers in the outer surface. It is also concluded that
   {[}O2C/OB/+/- 45B]s laminate is the best combination of the hybrid
   stacking sequences as far as buckling strength is concerned.}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by novel developments in surface-modified, nanoscale,
   magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) biomedical devices, we study theoretically the
   ciliary induced transport by metachronal wave propagation in
   hydromagnetic flow of copper-water nanofluids through a parallel plate
   channel. Under the physiological constraints, creeping flow is taken
   into consideration i.e. inertial forces are small compared with viscous
   forces. The metachronal wavelength is also considered as very large for
   cilia induced MHD flow. Magnetic Reynolds number is sufficiently large
   to invoke magnetic induction effects. The physical problem is linearized
   and exact solutions are developed for the resulting boundary value
   problem. Closed-form expressions are presented for the stream function,
   pressure rise, induced magnetic field function and temperature.
   Mathematica symbolic software is used to compute and illustrate
   numerical results. The influence of physical parameters on velocity
   profile, pressure gradient and trapping of bolus are discussed with the
   aid of graphs. The present computations are applicable to simulations of
   flow control of in nano-magneto-biomimetic technologies. (C) 2017 The

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR LIQUIDS}},

Volume = {{236}},

Abstract = {{Biomimetic propulsion mechanisms are increasingly being explored in
   engineering sciences. Peristalsis is one of the most efficient of these
   mechanisms and offers considerable promise in microscale fluidics.
   Electrokinetic peristalsis has recently also stimulated significant
   attention. Electrical and magnetic fields also offer an excellent mode
   for regulating flows. Motivated by novel applications in
   electro-conductive microchannel transport systems, the current article
   investigates analytically the electromagnetic pumping of non-Newtonian
   aqueous electrolytes via peristaltic waves in a two-dimensional
   microchannel with different peristaltic waves propagating at the upper
   and lower channel wall (complex wavy scenario). The Stokes couple stress
   model is deployed to capture micro-structural characteristics of real
   working fluids. The unsteady two-dimensional conservation equations for
   mass and momentum conservation, electro-kinetic and magnetic body
   forces, are formulated in two dimensional Cartesian co-ordinates. The
   transport equations are transformed from the wave frame to the
   laboratory frame and the electrical field terms rendered into electrical
   potential terms via the Poisson-Boltzmann equation, Debye length
   approximation and ionic Nernst Planck equation. The dimensionless
   emerging linearized electro-magnetic boundary value problem is solved
   using integral methods. The influence of Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity
   (characteristic electro-osmotic velocity), couple stress length
   parameter (measure of the polarity of the fluid), Hartmann magnetic
   number, and electro-osmotic parameter on axial velocity, volumetric flow
   rate, time-averaged flow rate and streamline distribution are visualized
   and interpreted at length. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A mathematical model is developed to analyze electro-kinetic effects on
   unsteady peristaltic transport of blood in cylindrical vessels of finite
   length. The Newtonian viscous model is adopted. The analysis is
   restricted under Debye-Huckel linearization (i.e., wall zeta potential
   <= 25 mV) is sufficiently small). The transformed, nondimensional
   conservation equations are derived via lubrication theory and long
   wavelength and the resulting linearized boundary value problem is solved
   exactly. The case of a thin electric double layer (i.e., where only slip
   electro-osmotic velocity considered) is retrieved as a particular case
   of the present model. The response in pumping characteristics (axial
   velocity, pressure gradient or difference, volumetric flow rate, local
   wall shear stress) to the influence of electro-osmotic effect (inverse
   Debye length) and Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity is elaborated in
   detail. Visualization of trapping phenomenon is also included and the
   bolus dynamics evolution with electro-kinetic effects examined. A
   comparative study of train wave propagation and single wave propagation
   is presented under the effects of thickness of EDL and external electric
   field. The study is relevant to electrophoresis in haemotology,
   electrohydrodynamic therapy and biomimetic electro-osmotic pumps.}},

Title = {{Utilization of Copper Tailing in Developing Sustainable and Durable
   Concrete}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS IN CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of an experimental investigation of the
   strength, permeability, abrasion, carbonation, and shrinkage
   characteristics of concrete containing various percentages of copper
   tailing as partial replacement of natural fine aggregates. M 25 Grade
   concrete was designed as per specific national specifications. Copper
   tailing was used to replace natural sand in the range of 0-80\%. It was
   observed that the copper-tailing concrete with up to 80\% substitution
   exhibited a comparable compressive and flexural strength when compared
   to the control specimens. From the abrasion test, it was noted that the
   specimens could be implemented in general-purpose and heavy-duty floor
   tiles. The shrinkage strains, water permeability, and carbonation of
   copper-tailing concrete were observed to be increasing with increasing
   replacement amounts of copper tailing. The concrete containing copper
   tailing replacing up to 70\% of natural fine aggregates could be
   recommended for all applications, and substitution levels beyond 70\%
   could be recommended for nonstructural applications, pavements, etc. (C)

   propagated by peristalsis}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{132}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 14}},
Abstract = {{A mathematical model is developed for electro-osmotic peristaltic
   pumping of a non-Newtonian liquid in a deformable micro-channel. Stokes'
   couple stress fluid model is employed to represent realistic working
   liquids. The Poisson-Boltzmann equation for electric potential
   distribution is implemented owing to the presence of an electrical
   double layer (EDL) in the micro-channel. Using long wavelength,
   lubrication theory and Debye-Huckel approximations, the linearized
   transformed dimensionless boundary value problem is solved analytically.
   The influence of electro-osmotic parameter (inversely proportional to
   Debye length), maximum electro-osmotic velocity (a function of external
   applied electrical field) and couple stress parameter on axial velocity,
   volumetric flow rate, pressure gradient, local wall shear stress and
   stream function distributions is evaluated in detail with the aid of
   graphs. The Newtonian fluid case is retrieved as a special case with
   vanishing couple stress effects. With increasing the couple stress
   parameter there is a significant increase in the axial pressure gradient
   whereas the core axial velocity is reduced. An increase in the
   electro-osmotic parameter both induces flow acceleration in the core
   region (around the channel centreline) and it also enhances the axial
   pressure gradient substantially. The study is relevant in the simulation
   of novel smart bio-inspired space pumps, chromatography and medical
   micro-scale devices.}},
