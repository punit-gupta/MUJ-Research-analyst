Abstract = {{The research works in Handwritten Devanagari Characters are continually
   evolving into new challenges, which exposed the new sources of further
   research work like, character normalization, gray-level normalization, a
   discrimination of the similar characters and many more. This paper
   discusses the discrimination of the similar characters, which is one of
   the major sources of classification error. The similar shape character
   has a very minute difference, which is called critical region and used
   to discriminate them by human beings. The primary goal of the current
   work is to identify the critical region of the similar character and use
   the same to generate additional features in order to minimize the
   classification errors in the end results. It is also quite challenging
   to identify the critical region as the characters are written in
   different handwriting styles and fonts. The paper suggestes the Fisher
   linear discriminant model to detect the critical region, which is used
   to extract the additional feature. The experiments work was conducted on
   the standard database, which has 36 172 handwritten Devanagari
   characters and significant improvement has been recorded by the
   aforesaid technique.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding molecular properties of outer membrane channels of
   Gram-negative bacteria is of fundamental significance as they are the
   entry point of polar antibiotics into bacteria. Outer membrane
   proteomics revealed OccK8 (OprE) to be among the five most expressed
   substrate specific channels of the clinically important Pseudomonas
   aeruginosa. The high-resolution Xray structure and electrophysiology
   highlighted a very narrow pore. However, experimental in vitro methods
   showed the transport of natural amino acids and antibiotics, among them
   ceftazidime. We used molecular dynamics simulations to reveal the
   importance of the physicochemical properties of ceftazidime in
   modulating the translocation through OccK8, proposing a
   structure-function relationship. As in general porins, the internal
   electric field favors the translocation of polar molecules by gainful
   energy compensation in the central constriction region. Importantly, the
   comparatively narrow OccK8 pore can undergo a substrate induced
   expansion to accommodate relatively large-sized substrates.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Recent research has shifted the focus from treatments to the
   preventive measures in young age. The aim of this study is to assess the
   impact of mindfulness training on self-esteem, self-regulation,
   mindfulness and psychological wellbeing of school-going adolescents.
   Methods: This is a matched controlled, pretest-posttest experimental
   study using school going 100 ``early adolescents{''} (50 in
   experimental, and 50 in control group), in the age range 10-14 years.
   Adolescent Self-Regulatory Inventory, Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale,
   Ryff's Psychological Well-being scale, and Child Adolescent Mindfulness
   Measure were used for assessments. The experimental group received
   weekly mindfulness training for ten sessions. Within and between group
   comparisons were done before and after the intervention using
   independent samples t test and paired t test.
   Results: Mindfulness training was effective in bringing statistically
   significant improvement in all domains of self-regulation, psychological
   well-being, self-esteem and mindfulness. Moreover, the experimental
   group showed significant improvement in all domains compared to the
   control group from baseline scores to the post intervention assessment
   (p<0.01).
   Conclusion: Mindfulness training is effective in fostering mindfulness
   and overall psychological development in early adolescence, including
   self-esteem, self-regulation, and psychological wellbeing. Mindfulness
   training should be considered at school levels because of its preventive
   and cost-effective nature, helping students become empathizing and
   socially mature adults.}},

Abstract = {{This article addresses the electrokinetically modulated biomechanical
   transport through a two-dimensional asymmetric microchannel induced by
   peristaltic waves. Electrokinetic transport with peristaltic phenomena
   grabbed a significant attention due to its novel applications in
   engineering. Electrical fields also provide an excellent mode for
   regulating flows. The electrohydrodynamics problem is modified by means
   of Debye-Huckel linearization. Firstly, the governing flow problem is
   described by continuity and momentum equations in the presence of
   electrokinetic forces in Cartesian coordinates, then long wavelength and
   low/zero Reynolds (neglecting the inertial forces) approximations are
   applied to modify the governing flow problem. The resulting differential
   equations are solved analytically in order to obtain exact solutions for
   velocity profile whereas the numerical integration is carried out to
   analyze the pumping characteristics. The physical behaviour of sundry
   parameters is discussed for velocity profile, pressure rise and volume
   flow rate. In particular, the behaviour of electro-osmotic parameter,
   phase difference, and Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity is examined and
   discussed. The trapping mechanism is also visualized by drawing
   streamlines against the governing parameters. The present study offers
   various interesting results that warrant further study on electrokinetic
   transport with peristalsis.}},

Abstract = {{Here we report, for the first time, development of nanocellulose based
   novel bio-nanocomposite injectable hydrogel scaffold. An integrated
   approach has been used to incorporate ultrafine fluorcanasite (FC)
   glass-ceramic particulates within nanocellulose matrix, synthesized from
   lignocellulosic biomass. Epichlorohydrin (ECH) was used as a chemical
   cross-linking agent for hydrogel synthesis. The compositions and
   properties of bio-nanocomposite hydrogels were controlled by varying the
   loading of FC and ECH. Moreover, microstructural characterizations and
   functional group analysis of synthesized nanocellulose and
   bio-nanocomposite hydrogels were carried out using scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR).
   SEM studies revealed successful extraction of cellulosic nanofibres and
   interconnected porous micro-architecture of injectable hydrogels.
   Incorporation of FC particulates resulted into development of
   well-defined micro-porous morphology. FT-IR studies indicated the
   presence of hydroxyl groups and possible interactions between
   nanocellulose and FC reinforcements. The rheological study of the
   developed injectable hydrogel was carried out at different frequency,
   amplitude and temperature sweeps. The studies revealed that after the
   incorporation of FC, dynamic storage modulus increased, while
   synergistically enhancing the injectability of the bio-nanocomposite
   hydrogels. An optimum loading level of FC reinforcement could also be
   established. Swelling behaviour studies of the hydrogels demonstrated
   higher degree of swelling and enhanced structural integrity with
   incorporation of FC. The novel bio-nanocomposite injectable hydrogels
   developed in this study, could demonstrate promising potential as
   injectable implant material.

Abstract = {{CeO2-HfO2 (CHx) binary metal oxides over whole composition range
   (0-100\%) are synthesised using the EDTA-Citrate method and calcined at
   600 degrees C/5 h. From XRD analysis, the sample series are classified
   as fluorite (F) phase for CH10-CH30, hybrid (F + M) phase for CH40-CH90
   and monoclinic (M) phase for CH100 sample, respectively and the results
   were further confirmed using Raman spectroscopy. From SEM analysis, a
   clear surface morphology change is noticed for fluorite, hybrid and
   monoclinic phases of the CHx binary metal oxides. Further, Selected Area
   Electron Diffraction (SAED) analysis also confirmed the single and
   hybrid phases of CHx binary metal oxides. The soot oxidation for the CHx
   binary metal oxides displayed high catalytic activity for Fluorite phase
   (CH10 similar to CH30) samples and a decrease in catalytic activity is
   noticed for the Hybrid phase (CH40 similar to CH90) samples. The change
   in catalytic activity coincides with the change in the surface
   morphology and phase change for the CHx binary metal oxides. Among the
   Fluorite phase samples, CH10 sample displayed the highest catalytic
   activity (T-50 = 430 degrees C) with higher surface area (29 m(2)/g),
   lower particle size (26 nm), lower degree of agglomeration (phi = 2.8)
   higher surface oxygen concentration (44\%). Isothermal-Time-on stream
   (ITOS) analysis also showed that the CH10 sample can achieve T-50 in a
   shorter time than compared to other CHx binary metal oxides. Surface
   morphology and phase stability can also play as key descriptors in
   screening CHx binary metal oxides for soot oxidation activity.}},

Abstract = {{Background Alcohol use is a leading risk factor for death and
   disability, but its overall association with health remains complex
   given the possible protective effects of moderate alcohol consumption on
   some conditions. With our comprehensive approach to health accounting
   within the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study
   2016, we generated improved estimates of alcohol use and
   alcohol-attributable deaths and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs)
   for 195 locations from 1990 to 2016, for both sexes and for 5-year age
   groups between the ages of 15 years and 95 years and older.
   Methods Using 694 data sources of individual and population-level
   alcohol consumption, along with 592 prospective and retrospective
   studies on the risk of alcohol use, we produced estimates of the
   prevalence of current drinking, abstention, the distribution of alcohol
   consumption among current drinkers in standard drinks daily (defined as
   10 g of pure ethyl alcohol), and alcohol-attributable deaths and DALYs.
   We made several methodological improvements compared with previous
   estimates: first, we adjusted alcohol sales estimates to take into
   account tourist and unrecorded consumption; second, we did a new
   meta-analysis of relative risks for 23 health outcomes associated with
   alcohol use; and third, we developed a new method to quantify the level
   of alcohol consumption that minimises the overall risk to individual
   health.
   Findings Globally, alcohol use was the seventh leading risk factor for
   both deaths and DALYs in 2016, accounting for 2.2\% (95\% uncertainty
   interval {[}UI] 1.5-3.0) of age-standardised female deaths and 6.8\%
   (5.8-8.0) of age-standardised male deaths. Among the population aged
   15-49 years, alcohol use was the leading risk factor globally in 2016,
   with 3.8\% (95\% UI 3.2-4-3) of female deaths and 12.2\% (10.8-13-6) of
   male deaths attributable to alcohol use. For the population aged 15-49
   years, female attributable DALYs were 2.3\% (95\% UI 2.0-2.6) and male
   attributable DALYs were 8.9\% (7.8-9.9). The three leading causes of
   attributable deaths in this age group were tuberculosis (1.4\% {[}95\%
   UI 1. 0-1. 7] of total deaths), road injuries (1.2\% {[}0.7-1.9]), and
   self-harm (1.1\% {[}0.6-1.5]). For populations aged 50 years and older,
   cancers accounted for a large proportion of total alcohol-attributable
   deaths in 2016, constituting 27.1\% (95\% UI 21.2-33.3) of total
   alcohol-attributable female deaths and 18.9\% (15.3-22.6) of male
   deaths. The level of alcohol consumption that minimised harm across
   health outcomes was zero (95\% UI 0.0-0.8) standard drinks per week.
   Interpretation Alcohol use is a leading risk factor for global disease
   burden and causes substantial health loss. We found that the risk of
   all-cause mortality, and of cancers specifically, rises with increasing
   levels of consumption, and the level of consumption that minimises
   health loss is zero. These results suggest that alcohol control policies
   might need to be revised worldwide, refocusing on efforts to lower
   overall population-level consumption.}},

Abstract = {{Electrokinetic transport of fluids through microchannels by
   micro-pumping and micro-peristaltic pumping has stimulated considerable
   interest in biomedical engineering and other areas of medical
   technology. Deeper elucidation of the fluid dynamics of such transport
   requires the continuous need for more elegant mathematical models and
   numerical simulations, in parallel with laboratory investigations. In
   this article we therefore investigate analytically the unsteady viscous
   flow driven by the combined effects of peristalsis and electro-osmosis
   through microchannel. An integral number of waves propagating in the
   microchannel are considered as a model for transportation of fluid bolus
   along the channel length. Debye-Hiickel linearization is employed to
   evaluate the potential function. Low Reynolds number and large
   wavelength approximations are employed. Closed-form solutions are
   derived for the non-dimensional boundary value problem. The computations
   demonstrate that magnitude of electric potential function is increased
   with a decrease in the thickness of the electrical double layer (EDL).
   Stronger electric field also decelerates the flow and decreases local
   wall shear stress. Hydrodynamic pressure is increased with EDL thickness
   whereas it is suppressed with electric field. Streamline visualization
   reveals that the quantity of trapped bolus is decreased with increase in
   EDL thickness and also with higher external electric field. (C) 2017

Journal = {{EPL}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{123}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Terahertz (THz) radiations focused at multiple positions are quite
   useful for their medical application. For this, we propose to employ
   beating of dark hollow Gaussian laser beams (DHGBs) of different beam
   orders in plasma. In view of realistic situations, we also include the
   collisions between the electrons and the neutrals. Because of a special
   intensity gradient distribution in DHGBs, the emitted THz radiation is
   found to have a unique field profile with multiple focii. The dependence
   of plasma density, order of the beams and collision frequency on the THz
   field amplitude is discussed. The important feature to consider hollow
   Gaussian laser beams is having the same power at different beam orders.
   It is found that the amplitude of the emitted radiation is highly
   sensitive to the beam order of the incident lasers. An optimization of
   the plasma parameters and the lasers characteristics can lead to the
   enhancement in the THz intensity and the efficiency of the mechanism.

Title = {{Fair-RTT-DAS: A robust and efficient dynamic adaptive streaming over ICN}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{129}},
Pages = {{209-225}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{To sustain the adequate bandwidth demands over rapidly growing
   multimedia traffic and considering the effectiveness of
   Information-Centric Networking (ICN), recently, HTTP based Dynamic
   Adaptive Streaming (DASH) has been introduced over ICN, which
   significantly increases the network bandwidth utilisation. However, we
   identified that the inherent features of ICN also causes new
   vulnerabilities in the network. In this paper, we first propose a novel
   attack called as Bitrate Oscillation Attack (BOA), which exploits
   fundamental ICN characteristics: in-network caching and interest
   aggregation, to disrupt DASH functionality. In particular, the proposed
   attack forces the bitrate and resolution of video received by the
   attacked client to oscillate with high frequency and high amplitude
   during the streaming process. To detect and mitigate BOA, we design and
   implement a reactive countermeasure called Fair-RTT-DAS. Our solution
   ensures efficient bandwidth utilisation and improves the user perceived
   Quality of Experience (QoE) in the presence of varying content source
   locations. For this purpose, Fair-RTT-DAS consider DASH's two
   significant features: round-trip-time (RTT) and throughput fairness. In
   the presence of BOA in a network, our simulation results show an
   increase in the annoyance factor in user's spatial dimension, i.e.,
   increase in oscillation frequency and amplitude. The results also show
   that our countermeasure significantly alleviates these adverse effects
   and makes dynamic adaptive streaming friendly to ICN's implicit
   features.}},

   using UV-Vis, FTIR, FESEM, EDX, AFM, TEM and XRD techniques. UV-visible
   spectra indicated the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) at 336 nm. The
   size distribution profiles were analyzed through XRD which revealed the
   crystalline nature of nanoparticles with average size of 45 nm. TEM and
   SEM micrographs showed that the particles are spherical and uneven. FTIR
   spectra reflected the evidence of the presence of anthraquinones,
   possible bio-molecules responsible for stabilization, reduction and

Abstract = {{A mathematical model to analyze the effects of electric double layer and
   applied external electric field on peristaltic transport of
   non-Newtonian aqueous solution through a microchannel is presented.
   Ostwald-de Waele power law model is employed to describe the
   non-Newtonian fluid, in an effort to capture the essential biofluid
   dynamics. The governing equations of physical problem are simplified
   using low Reynolds number and long wavelength approximations. Poisson
   Boltzmann equations are also solved under Debye Huckel linearization.
   Following non-dimensional transformation of the linearized boundary
   value problem, closed-form analytical solutions are presented for the
   velocity components, pressure gradient, average flow rate, and stream
   function subject to physically appropriate boundary conditions.
   Validation with existing results is also made. A comparative discussion
   between shear thinning fluid and shear thickening fluids under the
   influences of Debye length and Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity are
   presented numerically. Trapping phenomenon for dilatant fluids and
   pseudoplastic fluids under the electrokinetic phenomenon is also
   computed. This model can help toward designing artificial biomedical
   devices based on microfluidic devices which can also be applicable to
   control the physiological transport.}},

Abstract = {{Early rapid detection of Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis
   (MAP) bacilli in milk samples is the major challenge since traditional
   culture method is time consuming and laboratory dependent. We report a
   simple, sensitive and specific nano-technology based `Nano-immuno test'
   capable of detecting viable MAP bacilli in the milk samples within 10 h.
   Viable MAP bacilli were captured by MAP specific antibody-conjugated
   magnetic nano-particles using resazurin dye as chromogen. Test was
   optimized using true culture positive (10-bovine and 12-goats) and true
   culture negative (16-bovine and 25-goats) raw milk samples. Domestic
   livestock species in India are endemically infected with MAP. After
   successful optimization, sensitivity and specificity of the `nano-immuno
   test' in goats with respect to milk culture was 91.7\% and 96.0\%,
   respectively. Whereas, it was 90.0\% (sensitivity) and 92.6\%
   (specificity) with respect to IS900 PCR. In bovine milk samples,
   sensitivity and specificity of `nano-immuno test' with respect to milk
   culture was 90.0\% and 93.7\%, respectively. However, with respect to
   IS900 PCR, the sensitivity and specificity was 88.9\% and 94.1\%,
   respectively. Test was validated with field raw milk samples (goats-258
   and bovine-138) collected from domestic livestock species to detect
   live/viable MAP bacilli. Of 138 bovine raw milk samples screened by six
   diagnostic tests, 81 (58.7\%) milk samples were positive for MAP
   infection in one or more than one diagnostic tests. Of 81 (58.7\%)
   positive bovine raw milk samples, only 24 (17.4\%) samples were detected
   positive for the presence of viable MAP bacilli. Of 258 goats raw milk
   samples screened by six diagnostic tests, 141 (54.6\%) were positive for
   MAP infection in one or more than one test. Of 141 (54.6\%) positive raw
   milk samples from goats, only 48 (34.0\%) were detected positive for
   live MAP bacilli. Simplicity and efficiency of this novel `nano-immuno
   test' makes it suitable for wide-scale screening of milk samples in the
   field. Standardization, validation and re-usability of functionalized
   nano-particles and the test was successfully achieved in field samples.
   Test was highly specific, simple to perform and easy to read by naked
   eyes and does not require laboratory support in the performance of test.
   Test has potential to be used as screening test to estimate bio-load of
   MAP in milk samples at National level.}},

   palladium complexes (2a-2c) were synthesized by the reaction of
   2,6-bis(pyrrolyl)pyridine ligands (LH2) with Pd(OAc)(2) in acetonitrile
   as a solvent. Electrochemical studies of complexes 2a-2c showed two
   prominent oxidation peaks, which were ascribed to the dianionic
   pyrrolide ligand and an oxidation peak that can be ascribed to palladium
   metal center. There is an exhibition of well-coordinated metal directed
   oxidation of the complexes which indicates a well-established electronic
   network. Computational studies on complexes 2a-2c further supported the

Volume = {{132}},

Abstract = {{Oilfields located in western India produce crude by injection of large
   amounts of water during secondary oil recovery. This water is obtained
   from underground aquifer and contains 5 mM sulfate approximately.
   Sulfate present in this water is converted in to sulfide by sulfate
   reducing bacteria (SRB) present in the reservoir. Increased
   concentration of sulfide in the production fluid negatively impacts oil
   production and is known as reservoir souring. Most probable number and
   quantitative PCR enumerated 10(3)-10(8) SRB ml(-1) in various field
   installations. Isolates from produced water in sulfate containing medium
   showed similarity with Desulfotomaculum, Desulfomicrobium and
   Thermodesulfobacterium genera. Similarly, isolates from produced water
   in nitrate containing medium were related to Tepidiphilus,
   Paenibacillaceae, Kocuria and Thauera genera. In the present study four
   sand packed bioreactors simulating moderately high temperature oil
   reservoir were used for different souring control treatments. Results
   revealed that continuous injection of 4 mM nitrate or 1.5mM benzalkonium
   chloride (BAC) was not able to control souring. However, co-injection of
   2 mM nitrate and 0.75 mM BAC completely ceased sulfide production and

Abstract = {{With the advent of nanotechnology, it has become important to realize
   the immense potential of ayurvedic bhasma which had been there for
   centuries. The study of ayurvedic bhasma as nanomedicine is an important
   interdisciplinary research area in need of contributions from material
   science, chemistry, pharmacology, etc. Such a research will definitely
   help in the characterization and standardization of these bhasmas which
   is a very complex problem. However, this system is not getting
   recognition in other parts of the world. Among the various reasons
   listed for lack of popularity of ayurveda, is non-availability of
   `standards' for ayurvedic medicine particularly when prepared on large
   scale in modern pharmaceutical plants, matching the convenience
   palatability of modern dosage forms. Many times, it is reported that the
   preparation, particularly those mineral based are found to contain toxic
   substances exceeding permissible limits. There has been a lot of hue and
   cry regarding the safety and efficacy of the bhasmas, especially after
   publication of certain reports in print media. Further, the commercial
   pharmacies not adhering to the traditional methods adopt short cut
   methods and use of adulterated / substandard material augmented the
   apprehensions in public over their utility. It is therefore needed to
   explore the same with a multidisciplinary approach, the present study is
   contemplated. The present review is aimed at finding out the ways and
   means to standardize the manufacturing processes and develop
   standardization methods after they have been formed.}},

Abstract = {{Nanofluid dynamics with magnetohydrodynamics has tremendously
   contributed in industrial applications recently since presence of
   nanoparticle in base fluids enhances the specific chemical and physical
   properties. Owing to the relevance of nanofluid dynamics, we analyze the
   nanofluid flow in the presence of gyrotactic microorganism and
   magnetohydrodynamics through a stretching/shrinking plate. The impacts
   of chemical reaction and thermal radiation on flow characteristics are
   also studied. To simplify the governing equations of microorganisms,
   velocity, concentration and temperature, the similarity transformations
   are employed. The couple governing equations are numerically solved
   using Successive Taylor Series Linearization Method (STSLM). The
   velocity profile, motile microorganism density profile, concentration
   profile, temperature profile as well as Nusselt number, skin friction
   coefficient, Sherwood number and density number of motile microorganisms
   are discussed using tables and graphs against all the sundry parameters.

   number, skin friction, and density number of motile microorganisms with
   previously published results to validate the present model. The results
   show that Nusselt number, Sherwood number and density number diminish
   with increasing the magnetic field effects.}},

Title = {{Laparoscopy in management of appendicitis in high-, middle-, and

Abstract = {{Background Appendicitis is the most common abdominal surgical emergency
   worldwide. Differences between high- and low-income settings in the
   availability of laparoscopic appendectomy, alternative management
   choices, and outcomes are poorly described. The aim was to identify
   variation in surgical management and outcomes of appendicitis within
   low-, middle-, and high-Human Development Index (HDI) countries
   worldwide.
   Methods This is a multicenter, international prospective cohort study.
   Consecutive sampling of patients undergoing emergency appendectomy over
   6 months was conducted. Follow-up lasted 30 days.
   Results 4546 patients from 52 countries underwent appendectomy (2499
   high-, 1540 middle-, and 507 low-HDI groups). Surgical site infection
   (SSI) rates were higher in low-HDI (OR 2.57, 95\% CI 1.33-4.99, p =
   0.005) but not middle-HDI countries (OR 1.38, 95\% CI 0.76-2.52, p =
   0.291), compared with high-HDI countries after adjustment. A
   laparoscopic approach was common in high-HDI countries (1693/2499,
   67.7\%), but infrequent in low-HDI (41/507, 8.1\%) and middle-HDI
   (132/1540, 8.6\%) groups. After accounting for case-mix, laparoscopy was
   still associated with fewer overall complications (OR 0.55, 95\% CI
   0.42-0.71, p < 0.001) and SSIs (OR 0.22, 95\% CI 0.14-0.33, p < 0.001).
   In propensity-score matched groups within low-/middle-HDI countries,
   laparoscopy was still associated with fewer overall complications (OR
   0.23 95\% CI 0.11-0.44) and SSI (OR 0.21 95\% CI 0.09-0.45).
   Conclusion A laparoscopic approach is associated with better outcomes
   and availability appears to differ by country HDI. Despite the profound
   clinical, operational, and financial barriers to its widespread
   introduction, laparoscopy could significantly improve outcomes for
   patients in low-resource environments.

Abstract = {{A mathematical model is presented to analyze the unsteady peristaltic
   flow of magnetized viscoelastic fluids through a deformable curved
   channel. The study simulates the bio-inspired pumping of
   electroconductive rheological polymers which possess both
   electroconductive and viscoelastic properties. The Jeffrey viscoelastic
   model is utilized which features both relaxation and retardation terms
   of relevance to real polymers. A magnetic body force is incorporated for
   the influence of static radial magnetic field. The mass and momentum
   conservation equations are formulated in an intrinsic coordinate system
   and transformed with appropriate variables into a nondimensional system
   between the wave and the laboratory frames, under lubrication (i.e., low
   Reynolds number and long wavelength) approximations. Kinematic and
   no-slip boundary conditions are imposed at the channel walls. A magnetic
   body force is incorporated for the influence of static radial magnetic
   field in the primary momentum equation. An analytic approach is employed
   to determine closed-form solutions for stream function, axial pressure
   gradient, and volumetric flow rate. Spatiotemporal plots for pressure
   distribution along the channel (passage) length are presented to study
   the influences of curvature parameter, relaxation-to-retardation time
   ratio (Jeffrey first viscoelastic parameter) and Hartmann number
   (magnetic field parameter). The effects of these parameters on radial
   velocity distributions are also visualized. Cases of trapping and reflux
   in a curved channel are discussed. Streamline distributions are included
   to study trapping phenomena and to investigate more closely the impact
   of curvature, magnetic field, and viscoelastic properties on bolus
   evolution. The reflux or retrograde motion of the particles is studied
   by particle advection based on Lagrangian viewpoint. The simulations
   provide new insight into the mechanisms of pumping of electroconductive
   non-Newtonian liquids in realistic geometries.}},

Abstract = {{A range of bio-nanocomposites were prepared by incorporation of organo
   modified montmorillonite nanoclay (OMMT) with or without use of aluminum
   hydroxide (Al(OH)(3)) within polylactic acid (PLA) solution.
   Furthermore, the solution was employed for modification of
   ligno-cellulosic (jute) fabric structural reinforcements. The successful
   incorporation of nanofillers within the host polymer, polylactic acid
   (PLA) was confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR).
   Water uptake and swelling behaviour studies revealed that the water
   uptake and swelling ratio of bio-composites reduced significantly as
   compared to pristine jute fabric, whereas upon incorporation of OMMT and
   Al(OH)(3), the water barrier properties reduced even further in the
   developed bio-nanocomposites. The flexural strength of the
   bio-nanocomposites also showed improved mechanical and dimensional
   stability. Synergistic effects of OMMT and Al(OH)(3) were observed in
   enhancing the aforementioned physico-mechanical properties. Scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM) studies revealed microstructural details of
   developed samples. Similarly, the thermo-gravimetric analysis and linear
   burning rate studies of Al(OH)(3) treated bio-nanocomposite materials
   revealed enhanced thermal resistance and reduced flammability
   respectively compared to both pristine woven jute fabric and fabrics
   treated with PLA alone or those without Al(OH)(3). From the above
   results it can safely be said that the bio-nanocomposite material can be
   a prospective candidate for development of flame retardant biopackaging.}},

Abstract = {{The present study analyzes the heat energy transfer in nano fluids flow
   through the porous stretching surface. Cattanneo-Christov heat flux
   model is employed to study the heat energy transfer. Darcy law is used
   to discuss the flow characteristics over the different types of
   permeable sheets with suction and injection. Nanofluids is considered as
   water based single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and multi-walled
   carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) nanofluids. A comparative study for SWCNT and
   MWCNT is also made. Governing equations are transformed into set of
   ordinary differential equations using similarity transformations. The
   computational results are obtained by using Runge-Kutta fourth order
   method along with shooting technique. Numerical and graphical results
   are presented to discuss the effects of various physical parameters on
   velocity profile, temperature profile, Nusselt number, Sherwood number
   and skin friction coefficient for different type of nanoparticles for
   suction and injection cases. Stream lines and isotherms are also plotted
   for three different cases viz. permeable sheet with suction, impermeable
   sheet and permeable sheet with injection. A comparative analysis with
   existing results is tabulated which validate that the numerical results
   of present study have good correlation with existing results. The
   outcomes of the results show that skin friction coefficient is more for
   SWCNT in caparison of MWCNT and the boundary layer thickness is maximum
   for permeable stretching sheet with suction parameter.}},

Title = {{Mathematical modelling of pressure-driven micropolar biological flow due
   to metachronal wave propulsion of beating cilia}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL BIOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{301}},
Pages = {{121-128}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we present an analytical study of pressure-driven flow of
   micropolar non-Newtonian physiological fluids through a channel
   comprising two parallel oscillating walls. The cilia are arranged at
   equal intervals and protrude normally from both walls of the infinitely
   long channel. A metachronal wave is generated due to natural beating of
   cilia and the direction of wave propagation is parallel to the direction
   of fluid flow. Appropriate expressions are presented for deformation via
   longitudinal and transverse velocity components induced by the ciliary
   beating phenomenon with cilia assumed to follow elliptic trajectories.
   The conservation equations for mass, longitudinal and transverse
   (linear) momentum and angular momentum are reduced in accordance with
   the long wavelength and creeping Stokesian flow approximations and then
   normalized with appropriate transformations. The resulting non-linear
   moving boundary value problem is solved analytically for constant
   micro-inertia density, subject to physically realistic boundary
   conditions. Closed-form expressions are derived for axial velocity,
   angular velocity, volumetric flow rate and pressure rise. The transport
   phenomena are shown to be dictated by several non-Newtonian parameters,
   including micropolar material parameter and Eringen coupling parameter,
   and also several geometric parameters, viz eccentricity parameter, wave
   number and cilia length. The influence of these parameters on streamline
   profiles (with a view to addressing trapping features via bolus
   formation and evolution), pressure gradient and other characteristics
   are evaluated graphically. Both axial and angular velocities are
   observed to be substantially modified with both micropolar rheological
   parameters and furthermore are significantly altered with increasing
   volumetric flow rate. Free pumping is also examined. An inverse
   relationship between pressure rise and flow rate is computed which is
   similar to that observed in Newtonian fluids. The study is relevant to
   hemodynamics in narrow capillaries and also bio-inspired micro-fluidic
   devices.}},

Abstract = {{The pigment network is considered as one of the most histopathologically
   relevant indicator of melanoma. The objective of this empirical study is
   to design a novel automatic system for detection of pigment network and
   provide a differentiation between typical and atypical network patterns.
   The algorithm design consists a set of sequential stages. Pigment
   network masks are detected using a bank of 2D Gabor filters, and a set
   of pigment network features are extracted to determine the role of
   pigment network in the diagnosis of the lesion. In the second stage, a
   machine learning process is carried out using the rules generated from
   the pigment network masks to identify the typical and atypical pigment
   network patterns. The proposed methodology was tested on the PH2 dataset
   of 200 images, obtaining an average sensitivity of 96\%, specificity of
   100\% and accuracy of 96.7\% for lesion diagnosis, and an average
   sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 84.6\%, 88.7\% and 86.7\%
   respectively, for pigment network classification. The proposed system
   stands out amongst the few state of art literatures reported in the
   context of dermoscopic image analysis in terms of performance and
   methodologies adopted, thus proving the reliability of the proposed
   study. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical simulation is presented to study the heat and flow
   characteristics of blood flow altered by electroosmosis through the
   tapered micro-vessels. Blood is assumed as non-Newtonian (micropolar)
   nanofluids. The flow regime is considered as asymmetric diverging
   (tapered) microchannel for more realistic micro-vessels which is
   produced by choosing the peristaltic wave train on the walls to have
   different amplitudes and phase. The Rosseland approximation is employed
   to model the radiation heat transfer and temperatures of the walls are
   presumed constants. The mathematical formulation of the present problem
   is simplified under the long-wavelength, low-Reynolds number and
   Debye-Huckel linearization approximations. The influence of various
   dominant physical parameters are discussed for axial velocity,
   microrotation distribution, thermal temperature distribution and
   nanopartide volume fraction field. However, our foremost emphasis is to
   determine the effects of thermal radiation and coupling number on the
   axial velocity and microrotation distribution beneath electroosmotic
   environment. This analysis places a significant observation on the
   thermal radiation and coupling number which plays an influential role in
   hearten fluid velocity. This study is encouraged by exploring the
   nanofluid-dynamics in peristaltic transport as symbolized by heat
   transport in biological flows and also in novel pharmacodynamics pumps
   and gastro-intestinal motility enhancement.}},

Abstract = {{Two rationally designed -carboline-imidazopyridine hybrid
   chromofluorescent sensors S1 and S2 have been successfully synthesized

   synthesized sensors selectively sense copper ions through a significant
   color change from colorless to yellow along with a shift in their
   absorption spectra and enhancement in their emission intensities to turn
   on' the fluorescence mode in preference to other metal ions. Moreover,
   sensors S1 and S2 also recognize fluoride ions via H-bond interaction
   and subsequent deprotonation to elicit a color change from colorless to
   yellow conspicuous to the naked eye. Detailed UV-visible analyses
   revealed that the sensors interact with copper ions in a 1:1 binding
   stoichiometry with a detection range of 10(-7) M. In addition, competing
   binding studies by UV-visible analyses revealed that the sensors exhibit
   more selectivity toward copper ions in comparison to fluoride ions.

Title = {{In silico modeling of bone adaptation to rest-inserted loading: Strain
   energy density versus fluid flow as stimulus}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{446}},
Pages = {{110-127}},
Month = {{JUN 7}},
Abstract = {{In vivo studies suggest that cyclic and low-magnitude loading can be
   useful over pharmaceutical drugs in normalizing bone loss as it
   encourages osteogenesis (i.e. new bone formation) at the sites of
   elevated strain magnitude. In silico models assumed normal strain or
   strain energy density (SED) as the stimulus to predict loading-induced
   osteogenesis, however, these models may have limited success in fitting
   the in vivo new bone formation at several instances. For example,
   rest-inserted cyclic loading amplifies the new bone formation as
   compared to continuous-cyclic loading even though similar strain
   magnitude were induced in both the cases. It is also believed that
   loading-induced interstitial fluid flow can also be a potential stimulus
   of osteogenesis. The present study hypothesizes that fluid motion as
   osteogenic stimulus may explain the afore-mentioned anomalies.
   Accordingly, this work studies osteogenesis as functions of SED and
   canalicular fluid motion using an in silico model. Therefore, the new
   bone formation is considered roughly proportional to stimuli above their
   osteogenic thresholds. This model attempts to simulate in vivo new bone
   formation noticed in rest-inserted cantilever loading studies. The
   model's prediction of site-specific new bone formation improves when
   fluid flow is considered as the stimulus. It is also noticed that fluid
   motion as the stimulus closely fits the new bone formation for another
   in vivo study where the effects of aging on osteogenesis were examined.
   These attempts to establish fluid flow as a potential osteogenic
   stimulus can be useful in the prediction of site-specific new bone
   formation. The findings will ultimately be useful in designing
   biomechanical interventions such as prophylactic exercises to cure bone
   loss. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we have investigated the effects of multiple slip on
   inclined MHD Casson fluid flow over a permeable stretching surface and a

   chemical reaction. The analysis is carried out numerically for the
   momentum, heat and mass equations by solving the bvp4c MATLAB solver.
   The physical features of non-dimensional Casson fluid parameter, Schmidt

   variable heat source parameter, Prandtl number, Skin friction
   coefficient, local Nusselt number and local Sherwood number of velocity,
   temperature, volume fraction have been discussed and depicted by the
   graphs and tables. The theta and phi profiles were uplifted with the
   increment of the beta, M and Kp parameters on a suction and melting
   surface whereas the opposite behavior observed on f' profiles and the f'
   profile and momentum boundary layer thickness was depressed with the
   increment of the L-1 and L-2 parameters under a suction and a melting
   surface whereas the reverse behavior observed on theta and phi profiles.
   The impact of various physical parameters of melting surface and porous

Abstract = {{Previously, Callovian ammonites in the Jaisalmer Basin of western India
   were mostly known from the type locality of the Kuldhar Member at the
   Kuldhar River Section in the southwestern part of the basin. At this
   locality, the succession can be subdivided into six ammonite zones and
   subzones. For the first time, the present article describes ammonites
   collected from a river section (N27 degrees 07'06.60 `', E71 degrees
   05'24.72 `'), 1 km west of the village Kanod. In contrast to the type
   section, the Kuldhar Member in the northeastern Jaisalmer Basin is
   strongly condensed. Most of the ammonites occur within a 30-cm-thick bed
   of sandy, bioclastic siltstone with bored concretions. They belong to
   the genera Hecticoceras, Eucycloceras, Idiocycloceras, Sivajiceras,
   Obtusicostites, Kinkeliniceras and Hubertoceras. The assemblage is
   time-averaged ranging from the late Early Callovian to the early Late
   Callovian in age. The condensed nature of the sediment is also evident
   by abundant oysters and serpulids encrusting the ammonite shells. In
   total, twelve ammonite taxa are described and illustrated with a
   discussion on their biostratigraphic potential.}},

Abstract = {{Misalignments in gears cause vibrations and contact nonlinearities,
   which in turn cause load distribution shift on the gear tooth. The load
   distribution shift of the gear pair results in increased contact and
   bending stresses with the maximum stresses leaning towards the edge of
   the face width. These stress changes cause failures and gear performance
   variations, such as pitting, scuffing, crack initiation and eventually
   tooth breakage. In this paper, the contact and bending stresses of a
   misaligned spur gear pair were evaluated with and without friction by
   employing corresponding analytical methods and finite element method
   (FEM). Friction coefficient values of 0.1 to 0.3 were used to evaluate
   the effects of friction on contact and bending stress distribution of a
   spur gear pair with axial and angular misalignments. The stress
   concentration was found to be higher at the contact point and at the
   tooth root of the gear with the augmentation of the misalignment
   distance and angle. The maximum contact and bending stresses increased
   by 67.5\% and 18.9\%, respectively, when axial misalignments were
   subjected. Similarly, the maximum contact and bending stresses increased
   by 27.0\% and 62.4\%, respectively, for angular misalignments.
   Furthermore, the contact and bending stresses increased proportionally
   with the increasing coefficient of friction. Finally, the relationships
   between the normalized stress and misalignments (both axial and angular)
   were established.}},

Title = {{Establishing the relationship between loading parameters and bone
   adaptation}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL ENGINEERING \& PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{56}},
Pages = {{16-26}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Cyclic and low-magnitude loading is considered effective in arresting
   the bone loss as it promotes osteogenesis (i.e. new bone formation) at
   the sites of elevated normal strain magnitude. In silico models assumed
   normal strain as the stimulus to predict the sites of new bone
   formation. These models, however, may fail to fit the amount of newly
   formed bone. Loading parameters such as strain, frequency, and loading
   cycle decide the amount of new bone formation. The models did not
   incorporate this information. In fact, there is no unifying relationship
   to quantify the amount of new bone formation as a function of loading
   parameters. Therefore, the present work aims to establish an empirical
   relationship between loading parameters and a new bone formation
   parameter i.e. mineral apposition rate (MAR). A neural network model is
   used to serve the purpose. Loading parameters are supplied as input,
   whereas, MAR served as output. The model is trained and tested with
   experimental data. The model establishes an empirical relationship to
   estimate MAR as a function of loading parameters. The model's
   predictions of MAR align with in vivo experimental results. The model's
   response is analyzed which indicates that the bone adaptation
   characteristics are successfully captured in the relationship. The
   relationship established may be incorporated further to improve
   qualitative and quantitative prediction capabilities of computer models.
   These findings can be extended in future to design and develop effective
   biomechanical strategies such as prophylactic exercise to cure bone
   loss. (C) 2018 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   characterizations of PVA and PMMA self-standing films by doping Coumarin

   PMMA host matrix is more affected by doping in comparison with PVA
   matrix, which shows bond modifications and crystallization with small
   doping. The band-edges are observed to shift, thereby lowering the
   band-gaps of the base polymers upon doping. While the changes are seen
   only below the absorption edge in PVA, PMMA exhibits alterations in both
   the band edge and overall transmission in the range of 300-900 nm. The

Abstract = {{A theoretical study is presented of peristaltic hydrodynamics of an
   aqueous electrolytic non-Newtonian Jeffrey bio-rheological fluid through
   an asymmetric microchannel under an applied axial electric field. An
   analytical approach is adopted to obtain the closed form solution for
   velocity, volumetric flow, pressure difference and stream function. The
   analysis is also restricted under the low Reynolds number assumption
   (Stokes flow) and lubrication theory approximations (large wavelength).
   Small ionic Pecl,t number and Debye-Huckel linearization (i.e. wall zeta
   potential ae<currency> 25 mV) are also considered to simplify the
   Nernst-Planck and Poisson-Boltzmann equations. Streamline plots are also
   presented for the different electro-osmotic parameter, varying
   magnitudes of the electric field (both aiding and opposing cases) and
   for different values of the ratio of relaxation to retardation time
   parameter. Comparisons are also included between the Newtonian and
   general non-Newtonian Jeffrey fluid cases. The results presented here
   may be of fundamental interest towards designing lab-on-a-chip devices
   for flow mixing, cell manipulation, micro-scale pumps etc. Trapping is
   shown to be more sensitive to an electric field (aiding, opposing and
   neutral) rather than the electro-osmotic parameter and viscoelastic
   relaxation to retardation ratio parameter. The results may also help
   towards the design of organ-on-a-chip like devices for better drug
   design.}},

Journal = {{EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL B}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{91}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 21}},
Abstract = {{Graphene, topological insulators (TI) and the Weyl semimetal are shown
   to be well-characterized using the phenomenon of anomalous Rabi
   oscillation (ARO). These oscillations occur far from conventional
   resonance and Floquet theory shows them to be unique to these systems.
   Of particular interest is the bulk topological insulator (TI) where the
   wave-vector dependent frequency of the ARO is seen to be gapped in
   topologically trivial situations and gapless when there is a
   non-vanishing Chern number. It is shown that the Chern number may be
   directly inferred by performing a pump-probe experiment in the bulk
   without referring to surface states. A simpler alternative to the
   Lindblad method is invoked in order to incorporate dephasing effects
   that despite leading to a non-unitary time evolution of the
   wave-function, is nevertheless, probability conserving. The differential
   transmission coefficient versus the pump pulse duration (when all else
   is held fixed) has the form of a sinusoidal function with an amplitude
   that decays as a power law in the pump duration (alternatively, the
   ``area{''} of the pump pulse). The exponent of this power law decay is
   indicative of the Chern number of the bulk in case of TI and more
   generally indicative of the particular member of the family of materials
   that may be collectively referred to as - Dirac-Weyl materials.}},

Abstract = {{An analytical analysis is presented in this work to assess the influence
   of micropolar nature of fluids in fully developed flow induced by
   electrokinetically driven peristaltic pumping through a parallel plate
   microchannel. The walls of the channel are assumed as sinusoidal wavy to
   analyze the peristaltic flow nature. We consider that the wavelength of
   the wall motion is much larger as compared to the channel width to
   validate the lubrication theory. To simplify the Poisson Boltzmann
   equation, we also use the Debye-Effickel linearization. We consider
   governing equation for micropolar fluid in absence of body force and
   couple effects however external electric field is employed. The
   solutions for axial velocity, spin velocity, flow rate, pressure rise,
   and stream functions subjected to given physical boundary conditions are
   computed. The effects of pertinent parameters like Debye length and
   Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity which characterize the EDL phenomenon
   and external electric field, coupling number and micropolar parameter
   which characterize the micropolar fluid behavior, on peristaltic pumping
   are discussed through the illustrations. The results show that
   peristaltic pumping may alter by applying external electric fields. This
   model can be used to design and engineer the peristalsis-lab-on-chip and
   micro peristaltic syringe pumps for biomedical applications.}},

Abstract = {{Binary metal oxides of CeO2-Sm2O3 (CSx, x varies from 10 to 90 mol\%)
   along with pure CeO2 and Sm2O3 were synthesised successfully by the
   EDTA-Citrate method. From XRD, Raman spectroscopy and UV-vis DRS
   results, the whole composition of metal oxides exist in three phases:
   (fluorite phase (F) (CS10-CS30), bi-phase (fluorite (F) + cubic (C))
   (CS30-CS90) and cubic phase (C) (Sm2O3)). For CSx samples, the
   calculated band gap energy values obtained from the UV-vis DRS results
   were in between 3.0-5.1 eV and fluorite phase samples (CS10-CS30)
   displayed lower band gap energy values (3.04-3.07 eV) than compared to
   the samples in other phases. Similarly, from XPS analysis, fluorite
   phase samples (CS10-CS30) showed higher surface oxygen vacancy
   concentration than compared to samples in other phases. Catalytic
   activity for soot oxidation is carried out on CSx samples, and the T-50
   temperature is in between 480-540 degrees C. Fluorite phase samples
   (CS10-CS30) showed higher surface area, lower degree of agglomeration,
   lower band gap energy, higher oxygen vacancy concentration and better
   catalytic activity for soot oxidation. Among all the CSx samples, CS10
   sample displayed highest surface area (38 m(2)/g), lowest degree of
   agglomeration (0.36), lowest band gap energy (3.04 eV), highest oxygen
   vacancy concentration (64\%) and highest soot oxidation activity (T50 =
   480 degrees C). The order of the soot oxidation activity of CSx samples
   followed the same trend of band gap energy values.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, the design and performance of circular radiating patch
   element with two U-shaped slots and defected ground plane, comprising of
   a triangular notch monopole structure with rhomboid shape resonator, is
   reported. The proposed multiband antenna has a compact structure design
   for GSM 1800 MHz, WLAN, WiMAX and UWB communication systems. The antenna
   is designed on FR4 glass epoxy substrate of size 39 mm x 34 mm x 1.59 mm
   by using computer simulation tool CST Microwave Studio 2014. For
   confirmation of simulation results, prototypes are fabricated and their
   performance is tested in free space. Measured results demonstrate that
   fabricated antenna provides triple bands with impedance bandwidth of 157
   MHz (1.733 GHz to 1.89 GHz), 3.2 GHz (2.29 GHz to 5.49 GHz) \& 10.45 GHz
   (6.83 GHz to 17.28 GHz), almost flat high gain between 4 to 6 dBi and
   good radiation patterns in the desired frequency range. The maximum
   measured gain of proposed structure is close to 6.59 dBi at 4.40 GHz.
   The circular polarization is also realized in the frequency range 4.12
   GHz to 5.20 GHz with axial impedance bandwidth 1.08 GHz. The specific
   absorption rate SAR values of proposed design are also evaluated at
   various frequency spots which are well within the SAR values specified
   by the FCC. Proposed design may be proved a useful structure for advance
   radio communications systems as well as for the present requirements in
   defence applications.}},

Abstract = {{An analytical study of microvascular non-Newtonian blood flow is
   conducted incorporating the electro-osmosis phenomenon. Blood is
   considered as a Bingham rheological aqueous ionic solution. An
   externally applied static axial electrical field is imposed on the
   system. The Poisson-Boltzmann equation for electrical potential
   distribution is implemented to accommodate the electrical double layer
   in the microvascular regime. With long wavelength, lubrication and
   Debye-Hiickel approximations, the boundary value problem is rendered
   non-dimensional. Analytical solutions are derived for the axial
   velocity, volumetric flow rate, pressure gradient, volumetric flow rate,
   averaged volumetric flow rate along one time period, pressure rise along
   one wavelength and stream function. A plug swidth is featured in the
   solutions, Via symbolic software (Mathematica), graphical plots are
   generated for the influence of Bingham plug flow width parameter,
   electrical Debye length and Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity (maximum
   electro-osmotic velocity) on the key hydrodynamic variables. This study
   reveals that blood flow rate accelerates with decreasing the plug width
   (i.e. viscoplastic nature of fluids) and also with increasing the Debye

Volume = {{117}},
Pages = {{74-89}},

Abstract = {{In most of the medical therapies, electromagnetic field plays important
   role to modulate the blood flow and to reduce the pain of human body.
   With this fact, this paper presents a mathematical model to study the
   peristaltic blood flow through porous microvessels in the presence of
   electrohydrodynamics. The effects of Joule heating and different zeta
   potential are also considered. Darcy law is employed for porous medium.
   The mathematical analysis is carried out in the form of electroosmosis,
   flow analysis and heat transfer analysis. Velocity slip conditions are
   imposed to solve momentum equation and thermal energy equation. Time
   dependent volumetric flow rate is considered which varies exponentially.
   Closed form solutions for potential function is obtained under
   Debye-Hiickel approximation and velocity and temperature fields are
   obtained under low Reynolds number and large wavelength approximations.
   The influence of Hartmann number, electroosmotic parameter, slip
   parameters, Zeta potential, and couple stress parameter on flow
   characteristics, pumping characteristics and trapping phenomenon is
   computed. The effects of thermal slip parameters, Joule heating
   parameter, and Brinkman number on heat transfer characteristics are also
   presented graphically. Finally, the effect of Brinkman number on a graph
   between Nusselt number and Joule heating parameter is examined.}},
