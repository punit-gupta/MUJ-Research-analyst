The patterned substrates for this study were prepared by self-assembly of polystyrene (PS) latex spheres (~530nm) on Si (100) substrate. The desired magnetic nanocaps composed of CoO/Co bilayer film on these patterned substrates were prepared by molecular beam epitaxy technique under ultra-high vacuum conditions. For this, a Co layer of ~10nm thickness was deposited on the substrates and then oxidized in-situ to form CoO/Co/PS in-situ oxidized film or ex-situ in ambiance which also gives CoO/Co/PS naturally oxidized film. Simultaneously, reference thin films of Co (~10nm) were also prepared on plane Si substrate and similar oxidation treatments were performed on them respectively. The magnetic properties studied using SQUID technique revealed higher exchange bias (~1736Oe) in the in-situ oxidized Co/PS film as compared to that in naturally oxidized Co/PS film (~1544Oe) and also compared to the reference film. The observed variations in the magnetic properties are explained in terms of surface patterning induced structural changes of the deposited films and different oxidation methods."

abstract = "Composite materials are being extensively used in aerospace and automotive industry. The demand for composite materials is increasing due to their superior properties such as high strength to weight ratio, good corrosion resistance and high stiffness. Post machining operations such as drilling, orthogonal cutting, turning are necessary for composite materials to meet the dimensional and functional requirements. Drilling is a major process in manufacturing of holes, required for assembling the components in industrial applications. Drilling of holes in composites leads to a drilling-induced damage called delamination. The researchers have tried to reduce the drilling-induced damage by minimizing the operating variables and tool design. However, the research on delamination analysis using finite element method (FEM) is limited. This paper provides a comprehensive literature review on machining of composites which mainly focuses on conventional methods like turning, milling, trimming and drilling and also on simulation methods including discrete element method and finite element method. A brief and in depth review for drilling of composites using finite element method is delivered, which provides a knowledge on damage of the composites caused during drilling and orthogonal cutting. Comparison of experimental and simulation results shows an overall vision on machining of CFRP using FEM tools."

Retinal cysts are formed by accumulation of fluid in the retina caused by leakages from inflammation or vitreous fractures. Analysis of the retinal cystic spaces holds significance in detection and treatment of several ocular diseases like age-related macular degeneration, diabetic macular edema etc. Thus, segmentation of intra-retinal cysts and quantification of cystic spaces are vital for retinal pathology and severity detection. In the recent years, automated segmentation of intra-retinal cysts using optical coherence tomography B-scans has gained significant importance in the field of retinal image analysis. The objective of this paper is to compare different intra-retinal cyst segmentation algorithms for comparative analysis and benchmarking purposes.
(Methods)
In this work, we employ a modular approach for standardizing the different segmentation algorithms. Further, we analyze the variations in automated cyst segmentation performances and method scalability across image acquisition systems by using the publicly available cyst segmentation challenge dataset (OPTIMA cyst segmentation challenge).
(Results)
Several key automated methods are comparatively analyzed using quantitative and qualitative experiments. Our analysis demonstrates the significance of variations in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), retinal layer morphology and post-processing steps on the automated cyst segmentation processes.
(Conclusion)
This benchmarking study provides insights towards the scalability of automated processes across vendor-specific imaging modalities to provide guidance for retinal pathology diagnostics and treatment processes."

With the aim of securing the society from crimes, there is a need for advanced systems and new approaches for improving the crime analytics for protecting their communities. Accurate real-time crime predictions help to reduce the crime rate but remains challenging problem for the scientific community as crime occurrences depend on many complex factors. In this work, various visualizing techniques and machine learning algorithms are adopted for predicting the crime distribution over an area. In the first step, the raw datasets were processed and visualized based on the need. Afterwards, machine learning algorithms were used to extract the knowledge out of these large datasets and discover the hidden relationships among the data which is further used to report and discover the crime patterns that is valuable for crime analysts to analyse these crime networks by the means of various interactive visualizations for crime prediction and hence is supportive in prevention of crimes."

For this purpose, a genetically-engineered myoglobin (Mb) mutant was created by incorporating redox-active 3-amino-l-tyrosine (NH2Tyr) into its active site, replacing the distal histidine (H64) with NH2Tyr. In peroxide-shunt assays, this variant exhibits an increased rate of turnover for thioanisole and benzaldehyde oxidation as compared to the wild-type (WT) Mb. Indeed, in the presence of excess hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a 9-fold and 81-fold increase in activity was observed over multiple turnovers for thioanisole sulfoxidation and benzoic acid formation, respectively. The increased oxidation activity in the H64NH2Tyr Mb mutant underlined the role of NH2Tyr in the distal active-site scaffold in peroxide activation. Kinetic, electrochemical, and EPR spectroscopic experiments were performed. On the basis of these studies, it is argued that the single NH2Tyr residue within the Mb variant simultaneously serves the role of the conserved His/Arg-pair within the distal pocket of horseradish peroxidase."

The usage of cryptography characteristics of cellular automata are still not much explored in WSN. Hence in this paper, we present a symmetric key cryptography technique of block cipher using cellular automata (CAs) rules applied to sensor data in WSN. This cryptography technique uses non- complemented cellular automata rules and hybrid CA rule vector to form a group cellular automata that would be used to encrypt and decrypt sensor data.

A two-phase nanoscale formulation is adopted which is more appropriate for biophysical systems. The flow is induced by metachronal beating of cilia and the flow geometry is considered as a cylindrical tube. The analysis is carried out under the low Reynolds number and long wavelength approximations and the fluid and cilia dynamics is of the creeping type. A Lorentzian magnetic body force model is employed and magnetic induction effects are neglected. Solutions to the transformed boundary value problem are obtained via numerical integration. The influence of cilia length parameter, Hartmann (magnetic) number, heat absorption parameter, Grashof number (free convection), solid nanoparticle volume fraction, and cilia eccentricity parameter on the flow and heat transfer characteristics (including effective thermal conductivity of the nanofluid) are examined in detail. Furthermore a comparative study for different nanoparticle geometries (i.e. bricks, platelets and cylinders) is conducted. The computations show that pressure increases with enhancing the heat absorption, buoyancy force (i.e. Grashof number) and nanoparticle fraction however it reduces with increasing the magnetic field. The computations also reveal that pressure enhancement is a maximum for the platelet nano-particle case compared with the brick and cylinder nanoparticle cases. Furthermore the quantity of trapped streamlines for cylinder type nanoparticles exceeds substantially that computed for brick and platelet nanoparticles, whereas the bolus magnitude (trapped zone) for brick nanoparticles is demonstrably greater than that obtained for cylinder and platelet nanoparticles. The present model is applicable in biological and biomimetic transport phenomena exploiting magnetic nanofluids and ciliated inner tube surfaces."

Precision agriculture has always dealt with the accuracy and timely information about agricultural products. With the help of computer hardware and software technology designing a decision support system that could generate flower yield information and serve as base for management and planning of flower marketing is made so easy. Despite such technologies, some problem still arise, for example, a colour homogeneity of a specimen which cannot be obtained similar to actual colour of image and overlapping of image. In this paper implementing a new ‘counting algorithm’ for overlapped flower is being discussed. For implementing this algorithm, some techniques and operations such as colour image segmentation technique, image segmentation, using HSV colour space and morphological operations have been used. In this paper used two most popular colour space; those are RGB and HSV. HSV colour space decouples brightness from a chromatic component in the image, by which it provides better result in case for occlusion and overlapping."

Using these simulations, designer can choose the best method of air supply in the room diminishing the risk of an incorrect solution. This paper compares three cases in which integration of active (AC) and passive (EATHE) cooling was analysed with the help of CFD tool. The uniform heat flux from the surface was set to 55W/m2, AC air velocity of 3 m/s and supply temperature kept constant at 291K. k-ɛ model was considered for the turbulence model.

In this paper, we propose a new clustering algorithm based on LEACH.

In fact, there is no unifying relationship to quantify the amount of new bone formation as a function of loading parameters. Therefore, the present work aims to establish an empirical relationship between loading parameters and a new bone formation parameter i.e. mineral apposition rate (MAR). A neural network model is used to serve the purpose. Loading parameters are supplied as input, whereas, MAR served as output. The model is trained and tested with experimental data. The model establishes an empirical relationship to estimate MAR as a function of loading parameters. The model's predictions of MAR align with in vivo experimental results. The model's response is analyzed which indicates that the bone adaptation characteristics are successfully captured in the relationship. The relationship established may be incorporated further to improve qualitative and quantitative prediction capabilities of computer models. These findings can be extended in future to design and develop effective biomechanical strategies such as prophylactic exercise to cure bone loss."

The Coulomb and centrifugal barriers in experimentally identified 2p unbound 22Si show a quasi-bound state that ensures enough life time for such experimental probes.

The effects of Joule heating and different zeta potential are also considered. Darcy law is employed for porous medium. The mathematical analysis is carried out in the form of electroosmosis, flow analysis and heat transfer analysis. Velocity slip conditions are imposed to solve momentum equation and thermal energy equation. Time dependent volumetric flow rate is considered which varies exponentially. Closed form solutions for potential function is obtained under Debye-Hückel approximation and velocity and temperature fields are obtained under low Reynolds number and large wavelength approximations. The influence of Hartmann number, electroosmotic parameter, slip parameters, Zeta potential, and couple stress parameter on flow characteristics, pumping characteristics and trapping phenomenon is computed. The effects of thermal slip parameters, Joule heating parameter, and Brinkman number on heat transfer characteristics are also presented graphically.

abstract = "To sustain the adequate bandwidth demands over rapidly growing multimedia traffic and considering the effectiveness of Information-Centric Networking (ICN), recently, HTTP based Dynamic Adaptive Streaming (DASH) has been introduced over ICN, which significantly increases the network bandwidth utilisation. However, we identified that the inherent features of ICN also causes new vulnerabilities in the network. In this paper, we first propose a novel attack called as Bitrate Oscillation Attack (BOA), which exploits fundamental ICN characteristics: in-network caching and interest aggregation, to disrupt DASH functionality. In particular, the proposed attack forces the bitrate and resolution of video received by the attacked client to oscillate with high frequency and high amplitude during the streaming process. To detect and mitigate BOA, we design and implement a reactive countermeasure called Fair-RTT-DAS. Our solution ensures efficient bandwidth utilisation and improves the user perceived Quality of Experience (QoE) in the presence of varying content source locations. For this purpose, Fair-RTT-DAS consider DASH’s two significant features: round-trip-time (RTT) and throughput fairness. In the presence of BOA in a network, our simulation results show an increase in the annoyance factor in user’s spatial dimension, i.e., increase in oscillation frequency and amplitude. The results also show that our countermeasure significantly alleviates these adverse effects and makes dynamic adaptive streaming friendly to ICN’s implicit features."

The electrohydrodynamic (EHD) problem is also simplified under the Debye linearization. Closed-form solutions for the linearized dimensionless boundary value problem are derived. With increasing Hartmann number, the formation of bolus in the regime (associated with trapping) is inhibited up to a critical value of magnetic field. Flow rate, axial velocity and local wall shear stress are strongly decreased with greater Hartmann number whereas pressure difference is enhanced with higher Hartmann number at low time values but reduced with greater elapse in time. With greater electro-osmotic parameter (i.e. smaller Debye length), maximum time-averaged flow rate is enhanced, whereas the axial velocity is reduced. An increase in electrical field parameter (i.e. maximum electro-osmotic velocity) causes an increase in maximum time-averaged flow rate.

Blood is assumed as non-Newtonian (micropolar) nanofluids. The flow regime is considered as asymmetric diverging (tapered) microchannel for more realistic micro-vessels which is produced by choosing the peristaltic wave train on the walls to have different amplitudes and phase. The Rosseland approximation is employed to model the radiation heat transfer and temperatures of the walls are presumed constants. The mathematical formulation of the present problem is simplified under the long-wavelength, low-Reynolds number and Debye-Hückel linearization approximations. The influence of various dominant physical parameters are discussed for axial velocity, microrotation distribution, thermal temperature distribution and nanoparticle volume fraction field. However, our foremost emphasis is to determine the effects of thermal radiation and coupling number on the axial velocity and microrotation distribution beneath electroosmotic environment. This analysis places a significant observation on the thermal radiation and coupling number which plays an influential role in hearten fluid velocity. This study is encouraged by exploring the nanofluid-dynamics in peristaltic transport as symbolized by heat transport in biological flows and also in novel pharmacodynamics pumps and gastro-intestinal motility enhancement."

The Jefferys’ non-Newtonian constitutive model is employed to characterize rheological properties of the fluid. The unsteady conservation equations for mass and momentum with electro-kinetic and Darcian porous medium drag force terms are reduced to a system of steady linearized conservation equations in an axisymmetric coordinate system. The long wavelength, creeping (low Reynolds number) and Debye–Hückel linearization approximations are utilized. The resulting boundary value problem is shown to be controlled by a number of parameters including the electro-osmotic parameter, Helmholtz–Smoluchowski velocity (maximum electro-osmotic velocity), and Jefferys’ first parameter (ratio of relaxation and retardation time), wave amplitude. The influence of these parameters and also time on axial velocity, pressure difference, maximum volumetric flow rate and streamline distributions (for elucidating trapping phenomena) is visualized graphically and interpreted in detail. Pressure difference magnitudes are enhanced consistently with both increasing electro-osmotic parameter and Helmholtz–Smoluchowski velocity, whereas they are only elevated with increasing Jefferys’ first parameter for positive volumetric flow rates. Maximum time averaged flow rate is enhanced with increasing electro-osmotic parameter, Helmholtz–Smoluchowski velocity and Jefferys’ first parameter. Axial flow is accelerated in the core (plug) region of the conduit with greater values of electro-osmotic parameter and Helmholtz–Smoluchowski velocity whereas it is significantly decelerated with increasing Jefferys’ first parameter.

The XRD patterns of the films suggest deposition of amorphous alumina films while the FTIR and EDX analyses indicate the presence of alumina film on steel substrate. SEM images of coated samples indicate deposition of crack-free alumina films. The thickness of alumina films (dip and spray coated) were found to be in the range of ~1.4±0.2μm as indicated by their cross sectional views. The corrosion protection of the deposited alumina films has been checked by the electrochemical studies; open circuit potential (OCP), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and potentiodynamic polarization.

No intermixing between Fe and Au is seen. Corresponding X-ray reflectivity (XRR) measurements performed on as deposited sample shows clear Kiessig oscillations and can be fitted without considering intermixed layer between Fe and Si, while annealed sample shows interface mixing leading to an increase in thickness and density. The observed results are explained in terms of annealing induced changes at the Fe/Si interface which result in the formation of ß-FeSi2 phase."

The 3-m-thick unit shows a number of asymmetric folds and thrust faults leading to an imbrication of partly lithified sandstone beds. The deformation structures allow the reconstruction of a movement towards the northwest. This agrees well with the basin configuration that shows a deepening into this direction. Although the determination of a specific trigger mechanism is difficult for soft-sediment deformation structures, an earthquake caused by synsedimentary tectonics in the basin seems to be the most likely explanation."

This paper aims to investigate the unsteady flow of two types of nanofluids i.e Copper water nanofluids and Silver water nanofluids) through finite length non-uniform channel driven by peristaltic sinusoidal wave propagations.
Methods
The governing equations are reduced in linear form using dimensional analysis and considering the low Reynolds number and large wavelength approximations. The time dependent temperature field, axial velocity, transverse velocity and pressure difference are obtained analytically in closed form solution. Trapping phenomenon is also discussed with the help of contour plots of stream function. A comparative study of pure water (Newtonian fluid), Copper water nanofluids and Silver water nanofluids under the influence of relevant physical parameters is made in graphical form and also discussed. The effects of absorption parameter and Grashof number on velocity profiles, temperature profiles and pressure distribution along the length of channel are examined.
Results conclusions
The computational results reveal that the velocity profile is maximum for Silver water nanofluids however, it is least for Copper water nanofluids. It is also concluded the temperature profile is more for pure water in comparison to Silver water and Copper water nanofluids. This model is applicable to design, micro-peristaltic pumps which help in Nanoparticle-based targeted drug delivery and to transport the sensitive or corrosive fluids, sanitary fluids, slurries and noxious fluids in nuclear industry."

In silico models assumed normal strain or strain energy density (SED) as the stimulus to predict loading-induced osteogenesis, however, these models may have limited success in fitting the in vivo new bone formation at several instances. For example, rest-inserted cyclic loading amplifies the new bone formation as compared to continuous-cyclic loading even though similar strain magnitude were induced in both the cases. It is also believed that loading-induced interstitial fluid flow can also be a potential stimulus of osteogenesis. The present study hypothesizes that fluid motion as osteogenic stimulus may explain the afore-mentioned anomalies. Accordingly, this work studies osteogenesis as functions of SED and canalicular fluid motion using an in silico model. Therefore, the new bone formation is considered roughly proportional to stimuli above their osteogenic thresholds. This model attempts to simulate in vivo new bone formation noticed in rest-inserted cantilever loading studies. The model's prediction of site-specific new bone formation improves when fluid flow is considered as the stimulus. It is also noticed that fluid motion as the stimulus closely fits the new bone formation for another in vivo study where the effects of aging on osteogenesis were examined. These attempts to establish fluid flow as a potential osteogenic stimulus can be useful in the prediction of site-specific new bone formation. The findings will ultimately be useful in designing biomechanical interventions such as prophylactic exercises to cure bone loss."

The algorithm design consists a set of sequential stages. Pigment network masks are detected using a bank of 2D Gabor filters, and a set of pigment network features are extracted to determine the role of pigment network in the diagnosis of the lesion. In the second stage, a machine learning process is carried out using the rules generated from the pigment network masks to identify the typical and atypical pigment network patterns. The proposed methodology was tested on the PH2 dataset of 200 images, obtaining an average sensitivity of 96%, specificity of 100% and accuracy of 96.7% for lesion diagnosis, and an average sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 84.6%, 88.7% and 86.7% respectively, for pigment network classification.

Blood is considered as a Bingham rheological aqueous ionic solution. An externally applied static axial electrical field is imposed on the system. The Poisson-Boltzmann equation for electrical potential distribution is implemented to accommodate the electrical double layer in the microvascular regime. With long wavelength, lubrication and Debye-Hückel approximations, the boundary value problem is rendered non-dimensional. Analytical solutions are derived for the axial velocity, volumetric flow rate, pressure gradient, volumetric flow rate, averaged volumetric flow rate along one time period, pressure rise along one wavelength and stream function. A plug swidth is featured in the solutions. Via symbolic software (Mathematica), graphical plots are generated for the influence of Bingham plug flow width parameter, electrical Debye length and Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity (maximum electro-osmotic velocity) on the key hydrodynamic variables. This study reveals that blood flow rate accelerates with decreasing the plug width (i.e. viscoplastic nature of fluids) and also with increasing the Debye length parameter."

One such technique, for opening of energy gap in graphene, is by way of doping the pristine graphene with boron or nitrogen. Besides many important applications, to which B- and N-doped graphene has been put, the one very important for solving the global energy crisis is by way of its capacity for hydrogen storage. In this paper electronic structure of B- and N-doped graphene has been studied by using Density Functional Theory, as implemented in WIEN2K code. PBE-GGA (Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof 96) pseudo-potential is used for solving the Schrodinger equation in self-consistent manner and to account for the exchange and correlation effects through the use of Generalized Gradient Approximation. The band structure calculations reveal that whereas a band gap opens at the symmetry point K both for B- and N-doped graphene, the center of the gap (i.e., the Dirac point in pristine graphene) is shifted above the Fermi level by about 2.20eV for B-doped graphene, and shifted down the Fermi level by about the same amount for N-doped graphene, when the doping level was kept 25% in each case. The energy gap opened was found to be about 0.30eV for B-doped graphene and 0.45eV for N-doped graphene. The linear dispersion characteristics obtained at Dirac point for pristine graphene, almost vanish for B-/N-doped graphene, due to symmetry breaking and opening of energy gap. The band structure and Density of States of B-/N-doped graphene are found also to depend on the choice of cell parameters."

Tapered asymmetric microchannels are imposed at the walls to mimic sophisticated peristaltic wave propagation scenarios. The nanofluid is employed as the working fluid, and the analytical solution for electro-osmotic flow is obtained by virtue of the Debye–Hückel linearization.

Deeper elucidation of the fluid dynamics of such transport requires the continuous need for more elegant mathematical models and numerical simulations, in parallel with laboratory investigations. In this article we therefore investigate analytically the unsteady viscous flow driven by the combined effects of peristalsis and electro-osmosis through microchannel. An integral number of waves propagating in the microchannel are considered as a model for transportation of fluid bolus along the channel length. Debye-Hückel linearization is employed to evaluate the potential function. Low Reynolds number and large wavelength approximations are employed. Closed-form solutions are derived for the non-dimensional boundary value problem. The computations demonstrate that magnitude of electric potential function is increased with a decrease in the thickness of the electrical double layer (EDL). Stronger electric field also decelerates the flow and decreases local wall shear stress. Hydrodynamic pressure is increased with EDL thickness whereas it is suppressed with electric field. Streamline visualization reveals that the quantity of trapped bolus is decreased with increase in EDL thickness and also with higher external electric field."

The layers considered here are the core layer, the intermediate layer and the peripheral layer. The analysis has been carried out under a number of physical restrictions viz. Debye-Hückel linearization (i.e. wall zeta potential ≤25mV) is assumed sufficiently small, thin electric double layer limit (i.e. the peripheral layer is much thicker than the electric double layer thickness), low Reynolds number and large wavelength approximations. A non-dimensional analysis is used to linearize the boundary value problem. Fluid-fluid interfaces, peristaltic pumping characteristics, and trapping phenomenon are simulated. Present study also evaluates the responses of interface, pressure rise, time-averaged volume flow rate, maximum pressure rise, and the influence of Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity on the mechanical efficiency (with two different cases of the viscosity of fluids between the intermediate and the peripheral layer). Trapping phenomenon along with bolus dynamics evolution with thin EDL effects are analyzed.

This work may also contributes in electrophoresis, hematology, electrohydrodynamic therapy and, design and development of biomimetic electro-osmotic pumps."

The experimental Compton profile is compared with the corresponding theoretical profiles, computed using different exchange and correlation potentials within linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) scheme. The hybrid WC1LYP approximation within LCAO scheme shows a better agreement with experimental CP than other reported theoretical profiles. Going beyond Compton line shapes, the energy bands, density of states using LCAO scheme and modified Becke-Johnson (mBJ) potential within full potential linearized augmented plane wave (FP-LAPW) method are also reported. The optical properties like, dielectric tensors, absorption spectra, reflectivity and refraction are also discussed using FP-LAPW method. Energy band gaps computed using LCAO-WC1LYP and FP-LAPW-mBJ methods are found to be 6.89 and 6.76 eV, respectively which are in reasonable agreement with the available experimental data."

TEM studies of synthesized Ga2O3 confirmed the synthesis of monocrystalline β-Ga2O3 nanorods. To study the effect of precursor chemistry and to determine role of precursor structures on the crystal structure, phase and morphology of the Ga2O3, a new modified precursor complex was synthesized. The reaction of Ga(OPri)3 with N-phenylsalicylaldimine, [C6H4(OH)CH=N(C6H5)] in 1:1 M ratio yielded [{(H5C6)N = CH-C6H4O}Ga(OPri)2]. The newly synthesized complex was characterized by elemental analyses, molecular weight measurement, FT-IR and NMR (1H and 13C) spectral studies. Spectral studies of the modified complex suggest the presence of bi-dentate mode of attachment of Schiff's base in the solution state. Sol-gel transformations of [{(H5C6)N = CH-C6H4O}Ga(OPri)2] in organic medium, yielded γ-Ga2O3(b), as found by XRD studies.

Cross-overs of Fermi level by the energy bands corresponding to B-2p and valence d-states of transition metals lead to metallic character in both the compounds.

Most of the proposed mobile agent based schemes use static itineraries for agents׳ migration that are computed at the sink using a centralized algorithm. These centralized algorithms require global knowledge of sensor distribution, which is difficult to obtain accurately. Other issue with static itinerary based agent migration is that an agent may not move along its itinerary due to node failures or malicious node attacks. In order to solve these issues, we first propose a framework for trust evaluation to identify the malicious behavior of sensor nodes and then give a localized distributed protocol, called energy and trust aware mobile agent migration (ETMAM) protocol for periodic data gathering application. The results of our simulation study show that the ETMAM protocol is effective in improving resilience against node failures or malicious nodes attacks."

With ongoing interest in CNT nanofluids and materials in biotechnology, energy and environment, microelectronics, composite materials etc., the current investigation is carried out to analyze the effects of variable viscosity and thermal conductivity of CNT nanofluids flow driven by cilia induced movement through a circular cylindrical tube. Metachronal wave is generated by the beating of cilia and mathematically modeled as elliptical wave propagation by Blake (1971).
Methods, results and conclusions
The problem is formulated in the form of nonlinear partial differential equations, which are simplified by using the dimensional analysis to avoid the complicacy of dimensional homogeneity. Lubrication theory is employed to linearize the governing equations and it is also physically appropriate for cilia movement. Analytical solutions for velocity, temperature and pressure gradient and stream function are obtained. The analytical results are numerically simulated by using the Mathematica Software and plotted the graphs for velocity profile, temperature profile, pressure gradient and stream lines for better discussion and visualization. This model is applicable in physiological transport phenomena to explore the nanotechnology in engineering the artificial cilia and ciliated tube/pipe."

We aim to split the identity image into well separated partitions in order to simplify the identification task. Our system will use the gray-scale information of the fingerprints. The system will select the primary fingerprint, perform feature extraction & feature matching to identify the image in the database by comparing the featured values of both the fingerprints. Our implementation mainly incorporates image pre-processing, image partitioning, image binarization, feature extraction and feature matching.

Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) with basis set LanL2DZ have been used in this analysis. The experimental properties of the AunSi (n=1-8) nanoalloy clusters are correlated in terms of DFT based descriptors viz. HOMO-LUMO gap (eV), Electronegativity (χ), Global Hardness (η), Global Softness (S) and Electrophilicity Index (ω).

Three different layers i.e. the core layer, intermediate layer and peripheral layer are simulated with three different viscosities for each fluid layer. The unsteady two-dimensional conservation equations for mass and momentum with electrokinetic body forces, are transformed from the wave frame to the laboratory frame and the electrical field terms are rendered into electrical potential terms via the Poisson–Boltzmann equation, Debye length approximation and ionic Nernst–Planck equation. The dimensionless emerging linearized electrokinetic boundary value problem is solved using integral methods. Closed-form expressions are derived for stream functions in the core, intermediate and peripheral layers. Expressions are also derived for the core–intermediate interface shape and the intermediate–peripheral interface shape. Maximum pressures are also computed. To study bolus migration, the range of the trapping limit is also determined in the peripheral layer. It is found that in the core layer larger boluses are computed in the case of lower intermediate layer viscosity relative to peripheral layer viscosity although the number of boluses is greater when the intermediate layer viscosity exceeds the peripheral layer viscosity. Furthermore, in the intermediate layer, stronger concentration of streamlines is computed in the lower half space with positive Helmholtz–Smoluchowski velocity. Also negative Helmholtz–Smoluchowski velocity reduces the core layer (H1) interface shape whereas it enhances the peripheral layer (H) and intermediate layer (H2) shapes. At lower values of volume flow rate ratio, hydromechanical efficiency is maximum for positive Helmholtz–Smoluchowski velocity whether intermediate layer viscosity is less or greater than peripheral layer viscosity. Finally, greater with greater peristaltic wave amplitude and also for positive Helmholtz–Smoluchowski velocity there is an increase in time-averaged flow rate, whether intermediate layer viscosity is less or greater than peripheral layer viscosity. The analysis is relevant to electro-kinetic hemodynamics and bio-micro-fluidics."

Increased concentration of sulfide in the production fluid negatively impacts oil production and is known as reservoir souring. Most probable number and quantitative PCR enumerated 103-108 SRB ml−1 in various field installations. Isolates from produced water in sulfate containing medium showed similarity with Desulfotomaculum, Desulfomicrobium and Thermodesulfobacterium genera. Similarly, isolates from produced water in nitrate containing medium were related to Tepidiphilus, Paenibacillaceae, Kocuria and Thauera genera. In the present study four sand packed bioreactors simulating moderately high temperature oil reservoir were used for different souring control treatments. Results revealed that continuous injection of 4 mM nitrate or 1.5 mM benzalkonium chloride (BAC) was not able to control souring. However, co-injection of 2 mM nitrate and 0.75 mM BAC completely ceased sulfide production and controlled souring."

This paper presents the results of different properties and characteristics of jarosite added concrete along with fly ash during its fresh state. Jarosite is an industrial by product from zinc manufacturing industry obtained through hydrometallurgical process from its sulphide ore. It has been tried to incorporate jarosite in concrete as sand replacement. Different concrete mixtures have been prepared for three water–cement ratios (0.40, 0.45 and 0.50) and 5 jarosite replacement levels (0, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25%). Cement has been partially replaced (25%) by fly ash in all the concrete mixtures. Density, workability and setting & hardening of fresh concrete has been evaluated and analyzed. Keeping the environmental suitability of concrete in mind, toxicity leaching characteristic potential test has been performed on raw jarosite and concrete samples."

Our aim is to replace SPICE simulation with our proposed surrogate models, which can be used to evaluate samples generated by sampling methods in variation space. Our methodology initiates by first characterizing the leakage of basic transistor stacks and then provides estimate of the leakage of basic gates based on these stacks. Transistor stacks are extracted across various standard cells, which are used to estimate leakage of CMOS gates with different input vector combinations. We develop Support Vector Machine (SVM) regression surrogate models and characterize the transistor stacks of CMOS gates, while accounting the combined effect of process variations in transistor length (L), threshold voltage (Vth), oxide thickness (Tox), supply voltage (0.6V−1.2V), temperature (0°C−100°C) and width (28nm−200nm), all scalable at the same time. For gates containing parallel transistor stacks, we merge the parallel transistors having identical inputs, which in turn allows us to use precharacterized basic stacks for leakage calculation, thus avoiding generation of new models. Our experiments illustrate that we only require 30 and 26 stack models to predict the subthreshold and gate tunneling leakage of 20 different gates across 176 input combinations, instead of characterizing leakage model for each input vector separately. SVM regression models generated in our approach have the ability to predict the leakage with maximum average error of 2.7% in mean (μ) and maximum average error of 3.1% in standard deviation (σ), both for OAI22 gate. Our results establish that there is on an average 10× improvement in runtime while estimating the μ and σ of leakage of a gate within 10000 Monte Carlo simulation loop. Our approaches also result into a maximum of 221× runtime improvement for C6288 ISCAS'85 benchmark circuit. We further develop Sparse SVM models using Support Vector spectrum pruning method, which reduces the runtime of the regression models with negligible increase in the error. Runtime efficiency of 17× and 323× is achieved on standard cell library and C6288 benchmark circuit respectively using Sparse SVM models. Our models outperform previous models based on analytical equations and Artificial Neural Network in terms of accuracy."

This research paper depicts the application of highly powerful and accurate semi-analytical methods, Differential transformation method (DTM) to portray the non linear temperature distribution of convective-radiative fin with variable specific heat. With the help of DTM, the nonlinear terms appeared in governing equations are reduced to recurrence relation with non-dimensional terms. A longitudinal fin of constant rectangular profile through which air flows in transverse direction at ambient temperature has been considered for present analysis. The governing differential equation and corresponding boundary conditions are decided based on the heat transfer in longitudinal fin. The governing equation is non-dimensionalised for successful application of DTM with generalised terms. The results of temperature distribution in fin have been obtained for a range of values of several parameters of DTM. The results have indicated that DTM is efficient and convenient tool for analysing nonlinear differential equations of several environments. Present results have been compared and analysed with other analytical methods available in literature."

When compared to the control mixes, encouraging results were obtained in the tests to determine the mechanical properties of the concrete containing jarosite. The other important aspect of concrete i.e. durability has been revealed as satisfactory. The leaching of jarosite in concrete mixtures has been observed within the permissible limits of United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). The addition of jarosite as a partial sand replacement in concrete (along with fly ash as mineral admixture) up to 25% could be a new alternative feasible solution to its disposal issue. Also, the concrete with 15% jarosite as a sand replacement could be best suited for road and building construction purpose."

Bioremediation one of the important process of the above, degrades or transforms hazardous contaminants to less toxic compounds. Several groups of fungi have proved highly efficient in this aspect, with asbestos being one such toxic entity in the environment on which their activity was studied. The present investigation uses the same tool as a device for detoxifying asbestos, a potent carcinogenic entity; with fungal isolates native to the asbestos mines of Rajasthan, India, being investigated for the first time. The cellular mechanism of asbestos toxicity is mainly attributed to the presence of iron in its chemical composition which catalyzes generation of free radicals leading to oxidation of biomolecules. The two dominant novel species found therein, identified as Aspergillus tubingenesis and Coemansia reversa have proved capable of actively removing iron from asbestos fibers as studied by scanning electron microscopy- electron diffraction X-ray (SEM–EDX) analysis. This probably could lead to a reduction in toxicity of asbestos, due to reduced iron concentration as reported in related studies. Many fungi are known to release iron chelating compounds, siderophores, which could be instrumental in the study. The findings related to two new fungal species being added to the list of earlier identified fungal bioremediators of asbestos, widens the prospect of using bioremediation as an effective tool for asbestos detoxification"

The surface of stretching sheet is considered as pervious. Buongiorno model associated with Brownian motion and thermophoretic diffusion is also employed. Well known similarity transformations are used to convert the governing equations into a set of ordinary differential equations. The transformed equations are then solved numerically using fourth order Runge-Kutta method. The effects of transverse magnetic field and permiability on dimensionless fluid velocity, fluid temperature, skin friction, Nusselt number and Sherwood number are examined. The numerical results accomplished in the present study are validated and felt to be in good agreement with the previously published results. The numerical computations reveal that that the Lorentz force due to presence of magnetic field impinges its resistance on fluid motion and enhances the thermal resistance. As a consequence, heat transfer rate from the sheet gets reduced in association with the porosity of the medium."

The detection range for nitrate using this technique is 0.2ppm - 4ppm. Since nitrate detection is hindered by the presence of interferents viz. dissolved organic matter, nitrite, hexavalent chromium and surfactant, herein, we discuss the effect of non-ionic surfactant, TritonX 100, on determination of nitrate in water. The range of non-ionic surfactant (TritonX 100) is taken from 1 ppm-20ppm whereas cationic and anionic surfactant is not taken into consideration because of their null effect on nitrate determination in water."

Hence, the comparative study was conducted in both in vitro and in vivo leaves of T. cordifolia to locate endophytic fungi.

The crystallinity, bonding behavior and disorder in the films were investigated with X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), UV–visible and ellipsometry techniques, while surface morphology was studied using Atomic force microscopy (AFM). The nanocrystalline nature of PMMA is seen to be preserved in the blends although there are clear indications of bond modifications. The addition of PCTFE results in the improvement of overall crystallinity of the films via the interaction among PMMA and degraded PCTFE molecules when the films are casted from diluted solutions. In agreement, corresponding disorder in terms of Urbach energy shows a decreasing trend upon inclusion of more and more PCTFE molecules. Micro-Raman spectra are dominated by fluorescence background, which is proposed as arising from degraded PCTFE. Supporting this, FTIR spectra also shows modifications in bonding as a function of PCTFE percentage, but this bond modification is not enough to produce refractive index variation in the sample, which is dominated by the host PMMA contribution for all the PCTFE concentrations. The study suggests the useful range of PCTFE concentration in which PMMA host properties can be modified for optimizing optical and structural properties without much degradation of PCTFE."

Outcome of present computations are compared with available results and a reasonable agreement is recorded.

Optical absorption spectra investigations performed here, in the energy range from 3 to 5 eV confirms effective utilization of these compounds in solar cells and other optoelectronic applications. In addition, the transport properties computations performed using semi-classical Boltzmann theory, shows constant pattern of thermo power near ambient temperature range (200–500 K), which admits possible utilization of these compounds as low temperature thermoelectric materials. Performed ZT calculations demonstrates reasonably good thermoelectric performance for both materials, as there exist minor variation (0.1) in the values over wide temperature ranges i.e. from 100 to 800 K.

Closed-form solutions are derived for the nano-particle volume fraction, temperature, axial velocity, averaged volumetric flow rate, pressure difference across one wavelength, skin friction (wall shear stress function), Nusselt number (wall heat transfer rate) and stream function distribution in the wave frame. The influence of selected parameters on these flow variables is studied with the aid of graphs. Bolus formation is also visualized and streamline distributions are observed to be strongly influenced and asymmetric in nature."

Conventionally, seeds of the tree have been used as natural coagulants and flocculents in waste water treatment. Its leaves and bark act as biosorbent for remediation of heavy metals and dyes. The tree provides remedies for a range of diseases and disorders by dint of its unique combination of numerous phytochemicals. Gum exudates of the tree are of immense medicinal importance due to their applications in biodegradable drug delivery systems and in treatment of asthma, dysentery and intestinal cancer. The multidimensional utilities of M. oleifera may cause overexploitation of this tree, posing danger to the existing natural variability in the near future. Therefore, there is a need for conservation of the species for ethnobotanical, pharmacological, nutraceutical and biodiversity purposes. Development of tissue culture propagation methods will assist in preserving some of the germplasm of the species. In the present review, consolidated analysis of the role of biotechnology in conservation and genetic enhancement of nutritional, medicinal and commercial value of the tree has been placed in perspective, together with an up to date review on phytochemical analysis of the plant, and its utility has been discussed to invite the attention of the scientific community to further consider the study of this miracle tree species and its nutritional and pharmaceutical properties."

This paper reports the optical gain in strained InGaAsP/GaAsSb type-II QW heterostructure (well width = 20 Å) under external uniaxial strain at room temperature (300 K). The entire heterostructure is supposed to be grown on InP substrate pseudomorphically. Band structure, wave functions, energy dispersion and momentum matrix elements of the heterostructure have been computed. 6 × 6 diagonalised k→·p→ Hamiltonian matrix of the system is evaluated and Luttinger-Kohn model has been applied for the band structure and wavefunction calculations. TE mode optical gain spectrum in the QW-heterostructure under uniaxial strain along [110] is calculated. Optical gain of the heterostructure as a function of 2D carrier density and temperature variation is investigated. The variation of the peak optical gain as a function of As and Sb fractions in InGaAsP as a barrier and GaAsSb as a well respectively is exhibited. For a charge carrier injection of 5×1012/cm2, the TE optical gain is 3952 cm−1 at room temperature under no external uniaxial strain. Significant increase in TE mode optical gain is observed under high external uniaxial strain (1, 5 and 10 GPa) along [110] within IR (Infrared region) region."

abstract = "Structuring public private partnerships (PPP) in railways is a challenge, given its technology base, and obligation as a public and affordable mode of transportation. The sector provides strong incentives for vertical integration due to economies of scope. However, it is evident from the literature that large integrated PPPs in railway systems are not feasible due to higher commercial risks. They also suffer from implicit cross subsidization since the railway infrastructure is capital intensive, common to multiple revenue sources, and fare box revenues are generally not sufficient to recover investments. This is being addressed by various unbundling approaches in recent PPPs. The common unbundling is between infrastructure, operations, and services. The objective of this research is to explore the potential of unbundling further and to come up with a framework that helps policy makers in taking macro level decisions on PPP structuring. The research disaggregates the railway system into over 40 ‘elements’ wherein an element is the smallest unit that can be given to a party for execution. However this unbundling would result in significant horizontal and vertical interfaces between these elements. A sustainable PPP would need to limit the extent of interfaces due to transaction costs and risks. This can be achieved by bundling the elements horizontally and/or vertically into ‘entities’ to extract the best value for a PPP. The governing principles would be scale economies (horizontal integration), scope economies (vertical integration), need for competition (horizontal disaggregation), level playing field, transactional transparency, and need for specialization (vertical disaggregation). Additional drivers would be appetite for investment, availability of competence and accountability for an entity. The findings of the research indicate that the entity formation is one of the most crucial aspects of a PPP in railways. A consequential critical area is managing the interfaces between entities, which are subject to transaction costs and risks. These should be carefully identified and addressed by well-designed contractual agreements and independent regulation."

A geometric model is employed for a microfluidic tapered channel flow regime. Williamson's fluid model is utilized to characterize non-Newtonian nature of the base fluid. The normalized governing equations are reduced with lubrication approximations (long wavelength and low Reynolds number assumptions). Poisson-Boltzmann equation is also simplified by using Debye-Hückel linearization. No slip conditions are imposed at the channel walls. The analytical solutions are obtained for temperature field and nanoparticle volume fraction. However, a perturbation method is used to find out an approximate solution for axial velocity, pressure rise and volumetric flow rate. The perturbation solutions are further graphically illustrated with MATLAB software. The perturbation solution is also validated with numerical results simulated by MATLAB coding through BVP command. The effects of thermal radiation and non-Newtonian parameters on flow characteristics, pumping characteristics, wall shear stress and trapping phenomenon are discussed. A comparative study is also made to study the electroosmotic flow through uniform and nonuniform asymmetric microfluidic channel. This model can help to study the intrauterine fluid dynamics governed by electroosmosis mechanism. It can also be applicable in drug delivery, in vivo diagnostics, food diagnostics, packaging (smart sensors), DNA chips, protein chips and cell chips."

abstract = "A large number of mechanism were anticipated for copper since 1988 in NaCl medium. The detail electrochemical behavior leading to the anodic dissolution of copper, however, still remains uncertain. Herein, an Imidazopyrimidine Dye, named, 4-amino-3-(phenyldiazenyl)benzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-2(1H)-one, (APIP) has been used as a copper corrosion inhibitor in 3.5 wt. % (by weight) NaCl solution. The present investigation provides a brief mechanistic overview of the electrochemical mechanism of copper in aerated NaCl solution, simulating a static marine environment, with and without addition of APIP inhibitor. Potentiodynamic polarization (PDP) results confirmed that the APIP can suppress copper corrosion effectively at low concentration in 3.5 wt. % NaCl solution with an inhibition efficiency of 92.79% due to adsorption, along with the prediction of electrochemical mechanism. Electrochemical Impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements showed that the corrosion inhibition of Cu proceeds via both diffusion and kinetic controlled processes. Adsorption of APIP on copper surface is well fit with the Langmuir isotherm model and mode of adsorption is proposed. Antimicrobial activity was also studied and the result obtained showed ‘‘eco-friendly’’ nature of APIP. Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM), Energy dispersion X-ray (EDX) and Attenuated Total Reflectance-Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) observations of the copper surfaces confirmed the existence of adsorption of APIP thus can be potentially used in industries in which seawater is implied are numerous such as cooling water systems, desalination plants, power plants, and oil production units. Results obtained from theoretical calculations including quantum chemical density functional theory (DFT) method and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations confirms the experimental findings and provide further insight into the mode of adsorption on the copper surface."

We considered two different types of alloy nanoparticle namely nickel chromium iron alloy (Nimonic 80A) and titanium aluminum vanadium alloy (Ti%6Al%4V). The governing equations of the flow are solved using the Runge-Kutta and Newton's method. The present numerical results are compared with the previous study and found agreement with the uncertainty of ±2.5%. Effects of various non-dimensional parameters such as Eckert number, power index parameter, volume fraction, heat source/sink parameter, viscous variation parameter and semi-vertical angle of the cone on the momentum and thermal boundary layer including the friction factor coefficients and local Nusselt number are presented and analyzed for two different alloy considered in the present study. It is found that the viscous variation parameter enables to enhance the heat transfer rate. The Ti%6Al%4V alloy has higher friction factor coefficient along the azimuthal direction of the flow while Nimonic 80A alloy boosts up the friction coefficient along the tangential direction. It is worth to mention that the heat transfer rate of Nimonic 80A alloy is higher than that of Ti%6Al%4V alloy. Hence, Nimonic 80A alloy signifies a better thermal performance than the Ti%6Al%4V alloy."
