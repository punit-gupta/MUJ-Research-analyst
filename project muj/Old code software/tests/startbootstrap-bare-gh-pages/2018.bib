abstract={In the recent years, the improvement in the security is a challenging task in the Internet environment The Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is one of the significant tools used to detect the attacks. Various IDS techniques have been proposed to identify the attacks and alert the user or administrator about the attacks. However, they are unable to manage new attacks. This paper proposes an Intrusion Detection System based on the density maximization-based fuzzy c-means clustering (DM-FCC). In this approach, cluster efficiency is improved through a membership matrix generation (MMG) algorithm. Dissimilarity Distance Function (DDF) has been used to compute the distance metric while creating a cluster in proposing an IDS. The proposed enhanced fuzzy c-means algorithm has been tested upon ADFA Dataset and the model performs highly appreciable in terms of accuracy, precision, detection rates, and false alarms. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={The last decade being a web revolution in the field of electronic media, data and information exchange in various forms has significantly increased. With the advancement in the technological aspects of the communication mechanism, the textual form of data has taken the shape of audiovisual format, and more and more content over internet is being shared in this form. Data sharing in this form calls for the need of high bandwidth consumption which may slow down the network resulting in performance degradation of content delivery networks due to congestion. Several attempts have been made by the researchers to propose various techniques and algorithms to achieve optimal performance of the network resources under high-usage circumstances. But due to high-dense network architectures, the performance implementations of suggested algorithms for congestion may not be able to produce the desired results in real time. In this paper, we have presented an optimized multi-core architecture-based parallel version of two congestion control algorithms—leaky bucket and choke packet. The experimental results over a dense network show that optimized parallel implementation using OpenMP programming specification gets the network rebalancing in a very short span of time as compared to its serial counterpart. The proposed approach runs 60% faster than the serial implementation. The graphical map for the speed up continues to increase with the size of the network and routers. The paper throws the light on the implementation aspects as well as result analysis in detail along with some existing algorithms for the problem. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.},

abstract={Question answering field has evolved alongside the Natural Language processing. There are several small-scale applications that use the linguistic, semantic, and syntactic interpretations of text and consume it in further processing. In case of a web search, knowing what the query is intended for can save hours of CPU processing and decrease response time tremendously. We have taken a small step in this direction by treating the query as a question and classifying it with the best suited classification algorithm. In this paper, we have tried to find out that when a perfect-informer of the question (knowing what is asked) is provided as an input for classification algorithms like SVN, Naïve Base, and decision tree, we want to observe their accuracy on the same data set of questions. In our experiment, we have used the concept of CRF to find question features that are relevant. CRF is a probabilistic model that treats features as observation sequence and emits all sequence labels with probability values. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Sudoku is one of the most popular puzzle games of all time. Today, Sudoku is based on simple rules of placing the numbers from 1 to 9 in the empty cells of the Sudoku board. After solving the Sudoku, each row, column, and mini grid should have only one occurrence of each digit between 1 and 9. There are various approaches introduced to solve the Sudoku game till now. The solutions in the state of art are computationally complex as the algorithmic complexity for the solution falls under the class of NP-complete. The paper discusses various solutions for the problem along with their pros and cons. The paper also discusses the performance of a serial version solution with respect to execution time taken to solve Sudoku. With certain modifications and assumptions to the serial version code, we have evaluated the possible solution and bottleneck in the parallel approach. The results have been evaluated for the parallelized algorithm on a normal user machine first, and then on a supercomputing solution box PARAMSHAVAK. Finally, the paper is concluded with the analysis of all the three solution aspects proposed. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Sign language is a gesture-based language for communication of deaf people. It is basically a nonverbal symbolic language which is usually used to speak with and by deaf people. Indian sign language is a linguistically under-investigated language. Research on Indian sign language linguistics is also limited because of unavailability of standard sign dictionary and the unavailability of such tools which provide any education for Indian sign language. In the interpretation between sign language and verbal spoken language, there is an intermediate step in which the sign language needs to be represented by some written notation. However, there is as yet no standard notation for Indian sign language. In this paper, we investigate intermediate notation form for sign language as suitable for the machine translation. We also discuss the challenges of other linguistic issues for machine translation on Indian sign language. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.},

abstract={Topological sort referred to as topo sort or topological ordering is defined as constraint-based ordering of nodes (vertices) of graph G or DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph). In other words, it gives a linearized order of graph nodes describing the relationship between the graph vertices. Many applications of various fields in computer science require a constraint-based ordering of tasks and, thus, topological sorting holds a big place of importance for many applications like semantic analysis in compiler design, Gantt chart generation in software project management and many more. In this paper, a parallel version of this ordering algorithm over CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) has been discussed by identifying an approach to process-independent portions of the graph simultaneously for load flow analysis over radial distribution networks. The serial implementation of topological sort has been first discussed followed by its implementation on thread-block architecture of CUDA modifying the serial algorithm. Finally, the efficiency of this parallel version of topo sort has been investigated on various structures of graph modeled from radial distribution networks and has been reported. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

It is very hard to predict the outcomes (risky borrower) manually as the evaluation of large features set is quite time consuming. That’s why, we need some good predictor as classifier. The traditional k-NN is one pre-established classifier used in various domains along with credit risk predictions. The newly conceptualized ARSkNN is another such classification which reduces the runtime in predicting the outcomes and improves overall accuracy percentage of the predicted classes over Traditional k-NN. The method adopt the similarity measure which is based on the Mass estimation rather than distance estimation for predicting the K- nearest neighbor. The results were compared using WEKA 3.7.10 as tool and found significant improvement vis-á-vis the evaluation parameters by the ARSkNN method. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.},

In recent years, there have been huge developments in automotive industry, computing, and communication technologies. This has led Vehicular Cloud Computing (VCC) as a solution to satisfy the requirements of VANETs such as computing, storage, and networking resources.

abstract={Crimes are treacherous and common social problem faced worldwide. Crimes affect the quality of life, economic growth, and reputation of a nation. There has been an enormous increase in crime rate in the last few years. In order to reduce the crime rate, the law enforcements need to take the preventive measures. With the aim of securing the society from crimes, there is a need for advanced systems and new approaches for improving the crime analytics for protecting their communities. Accurate real-time crime predictions help to reduce the crime rate but remains challenging problem for the scientific community as crime occurrences depend on many complex factors. In this work, various visualizing techniques and machine learning algorithms are adopted for predicting the crime distribution over an area. In the first step, the raw datasets were processed and visualized based on the need. Afterwards, machine learning algorithms were used to extract the knowledge out of these large datasets and discover the hidden relationships among the data which is further used to report and discover the crime patterns that is valuable for crime analysts to analyse these crime networks by the means of various interactive visualizations for crime prediction and hence is supportive in prevention of crimes. © 2018 The Authors.

Therefore, energy saving is of supreme importance and is demonstrated by large number of algorithms, methods and protocols proposed for this cause. However, in the context of wireless sensor networks (WSNs), the principle of connected dominating set (CDS) has emerged out as the most popular method for energy efficient TC. This paper presents the performance evaluation of a CDS-based TC algorithm to develop a reduced topology with very low complexity and minimum the need of location information. The simulation results demonstrate the performance of algorithm in terms of low message overhead under reduced topology with a reasonable amount of energy consumption. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

The numbers of the vehicles are growing very rapidly which produced the problem of the parking. There are diverse techniques that have been introduced by many researchers those are used according to the need and scale. This paper is addressed the problem of vehicle parking for small scale by using the surveillance camera. A background subtraction is used to detect moving vehicle. The moving vehicles are tracked using the Gaussian mixture model and a foreground mask is created. Dilation is applied to remove inconsistent and noise particles. The variable intensity distribution is plotted on a histogram and changes are identified to count vehicles. Each parking spot can accommodate only certain numbers of vehicle. If the count has reached the maximum limit then the display unit guides the driver to next available parking spot. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

With the innovation in the theory of augmented reality and rapid advancement of real-time applications (robotics), there is a requirement to advance a system or a method to optimize the latency time in various challenging conditions. However, there is no standard method for optimizing glyph detection latency time through the Augmented Reality framework in the literature. Even though, currently some applications are using the marker (glyph) less AR system, there are challenges in the detection of object in real-time application and to overcome this complication, the glyph detection system is proposed. Here, we propose the machine glyph detection algorithm and mathematical formulation which calculate the optimized latency time through the rectifier and infra-red light in challenging conditions. The detection process and position of glyph have been processed by the ‘AForge.NET Framework’ and the POSIT algorithm. The experimentation outcomes calculate the performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of optimizing latency and accuracy. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={With the growth of civilization the demand of cement concrete is increasing rapidly which increase the production of cement and abolishing the natural source of limestone. Also contributing a lot to the global warming by generating huge amount of carbon-di-oxide. Therefore the present study concentrate on the production of concrete using the geopolymerization technology which replaces cement fully by fly ash, a waste material and alkali solution. India is presently producing approximately 190 million tons of fly ash every year from moreover 145 power plants. Present research is focused on the different parameters which are curing temperature, ratio of sodium silicate to sodium hydroxide, molarity of sodium hydroxide, curing type and the results have been studied and discussed. Previous works emphasis that only the use of fly ash as the base material confine the concrete to be heat cured which limits the applicability of geopolymer concrete to cast-in-situ conditions. So some proportion of flyash is replaced by ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) and the effect on compressive and tensile strength is observed. Ambient temperature dry curing was done without any water when some proportion of fly ash was replaced by GGBFS. The ratio of sodium silicate solution to sodium hydroxide solution by mass was kept fixed at 2.5 and the concentration of sodium hydroxide was kept 14M. The ratio of flyash to alkali solution was kept 0.35 & 0.40. Replacing 40% of Flyash by GGBFS and keeping the concentration of NaOH as 14M at ambient temperature, the compressive strength encountered was 40 MPa. © 2018 Authors.},

Speech samples of ID children were recorded from a government-owned special school in India and used for the analysis. Control samples were taken from the author’s institute. Pre-processing techniques were used for better parameterization. Two classifiers, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Linear Discriminant Analysis, were applied to classify between disordered and the normal speech. Cross-validation technique was used to evaluate the reliability of the classifier. This study has discussed the effect on the classification accuracy using different values of frame size, percentage of frame overlapping, α value of pre-emphasis first-order filter and the order p. The experimental calculation interpreted that all the three parameterization techniques can be used for the correct classification of the ID speech from controls and WLPCC features slightly outperform than LPCC and considerably outperforms than LPC features. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Telugu is the standard language used to communicate mainly in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana states with approximately 100 million speakers. Every Telugu word ends with vowels. Automatic speech recognition has major applications in the smart world. Telugu speech recognition has a huge scope of research from past decade. This paper deals with Telugu speech recognition in a speaker-dependent format for 10 words which are numbers from one to ten uttered by 10 speakers which creates a data base of 100 samples. Numbers are very frequently spoken words where recognition of these words plays a major role in Telugu speech recognition. These spoken words are preprocessed using various techniques like de-noising, framing, sampling, transformations, and endpoint detection. Methods like mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and combined MFCC with modified group delay functions (MODGDF) are used for extracting the features. Extracted features are used for training and testing phase. Multilayer perceptron (MLP) and time lagged recurrent neural network (TLRN) patterns are trained and tested. Comparison is done for MLP and TLRN with the feature extraction techniques MFCC and MODGDF-MFCC. Integrated MODGDF-MFCC gives best accuracy in training and testing phases. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) are fast replacing incandescent lamps and CFLs in most of the developing nations. The reason can be attributed mainly to the enhanced lifetime and less energy consumption as compared to the other mentioned types. However one important aspect needs attention, the impact of driver on LEDs. LEDs are current controlled devices and hence emit maximum light with increase in current input to the device. This feature, boost up the light output but it increases the junction temperature of the device. Hence additional heat sinks are required to vent out the excessive heat generated due to increase current input to the LEDs. Those additional heat sinks are at times difficult to accommodate. So, designers have made arrangements to vent out the heat from the device. This is achieved by designing fins. However this arrangement is not suitable in places where the ambient temperature is more than normal. Thus, design of LED driver with controlled current input is essential in order to maintain the thermal limit of the device. Secondly, the AC-DC LEDs driver circuits, which are available in the market, are seldom equipped with input power factor and THD improvement circuitry as prescribed in IEC61000- 3-2. This is essential for maintaining the energy efficiency of the nearest utility services and in addition also improves on the current drawn by the device. The following work envisages these issues and proposes corrective driver circuit based on two different driver topologies, buck-boost topology and flyback topology. Both these topologies are proposed in order to address the aspects of power quality and its impact on the life of the device. The simulation were done using Green Point simulation tool from On Semiconductors. © 2018, LLC Editorial of Journal "Light Technik". All rights reserved.},

abstract={Concurrent workflow scheduling algorithm works in three phases, namely rank computation, tasks selection, and resource selection. In this paper, we introduce a new ranking algorithm that computes the rank of a task, based on its successor rank and its predecessors average communication time, instead of its successors rank. The advantage of this ranking algorithm is that two dependent tasks are assigned to the same machine and as a result the scheduled length is reduced. The task selection phase selects a ready task from each workflow and creates a task pool. The resource selection phase initially assigns tasks using min-min heuristic, after initial assignment, tasks are moved from the highly loaded machines to the lightly loaded machines. Our resource selection algorithm increases the load balance among the resources due to tasks assignment heuristic and reassignment of tasks from the highly loaded machines. The simulation results show that our proposed scheduling algorithm performs better over existing approaches in terms of load balance, makespan and turnaround time. © 2018 Slovak Academy of Sciences.

To define trends in Big Data we need to concentrate on the biggest challenges faced by this technology and various strategies have been developed in order to process such large data efficiently. We usually describe this by three factors, popularly known as 3Vs i.e. Volume, Velocity and Variety, which describes most of the features of data. The goal of this chapter is to provide traditional meaning and definitions of big data and how this technology is evolved in order to meet todays requirements and challenges. In this chapter we will describe all the attributes of big data i.e. popularly known as 9Vs. Business Intelligence contains these nine attributes on the basis of statistical models or hypothesis in order to provide better predictions and outcomes for any research or results. Machine Learning provides the platform where the big data analysis can be done using cloud computing. With the help of this chapter academicians, business people and researchers can easily find opportunities as a solution for their required purpose. © 2018 The authors and IOS Press.

abstract={The quick extension of mobile big data by telecoms vendors, has presented a flexible worldwide platform that creates a user interface for many app data bases or app stores. Big data is a tremendously well-known idea, however what are we truly talking about? From a security point of view, there are two particular issues: securing the app stores or app databases with its source of information in big data context and utilizing big data procedures to break down, and even anticipate, security flaws. The main issue arise that many hackers or attackers are targeting mobile big data in the form of signaling big data, mobile traffic big data, location-based big data, and heterogeneous data in app store. In this paper, we are taking Android-based mobile operating system for experimental setup. This paper contains an extraction technique to extract the malware in different big data context and also analysis of these malware. We have worked with many Mallarme family (as approx 40 K malware) in mobile big data and result of the whole analysis is approx 90% to identify the current malware in mobile big data. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

In this paper, different types of analog circuits exhibiting nonlinear dynamics have been reviewed. It has been shown that such circuits can generate signals which have frequency spectrum characteristics similar to noise. This leads to an important conclusion that a low-cost spread spectrum-based secure communication model can be developed using analog circuits. A few of the secure communication models developed using these analog circuits have also been reviewed.

abstract={The flow characteristics of nanofluids flow driven by combined effects of electroosmosis and peristalsis are very important for designing bio-mimetic pumping systems at the micro scale of interest in physiological treatment e.g. ocular drug delivery systems. The flow characteristics of thermally developed nanofluids flow are investigated in presence of peristalsis and electroosmosis phenomena. Thermal radiation effect is also introduced. Tapered asymmetric microchannels are imposed at the walls to mimic sophisticated peristaltic wave propagation scenarios. The nanofluid is employed as the working fluid, and the analytical solution for electro-osmotic flow is obtained by virtue of the Debye–Hückel linearization. The dimensional conservation equations are linearized under lubrication theory approximations. The effects of emerging physical parameters namely Grashof numbers, Brownian motion parameter, thermophoresis parameter, Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity, Debye length and thermal radiation on flow characteristics, heat transfer characteristics, and pumping characteristics are computed. Furthermore, an inherent phenomenon of peristaltic pumping known as trapping is also presented graphically under the influence of pertinent parameters and discussed in brief. Validation of present model is also presented. This model is mainly applicable to study cell responses, blood analysis, biomimetic capillary designs, and blood vessel tissue culture systems. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

The synthesized sensors selectively sense copper ions through a significant color change from colorless to yellow along with a shift in their absorption spectra and enhancement in their emission intensities to turn on the fluorescence mode in preference to other metal ions. Moreover, sensors S1 and S2 also recognize fluoride ions via H-bond interaction and subsequent deprotonation to elicit a color change from colorless to yellow conspicuous to the naked eye. Detailed UV-visible analyses revealed that the sensors interact with copper ions in a 1: 1 binding stoichiometry with a detection range of 10-7 M. In addition, competing binding studies by UV-visible analyses revealed that the sensors exhibit more selectivity toward copper ions in comparison to fluoride ions.

abstract={The automatic speech recognition systems are designed for human–computer interaction in trouble-free mode. Speech recognition has vast applications. Text to speech and speech to text transformations are mostly used segments in ASR. Perfect speech recognition is done by choosing proper extraction and classification techniques with respect to slang and pitch of the language. Telugu is a south Indian language which has around 120 million speakers. There are various feature extraction techniques such as LPC, MFCC, MODGDF, RASTA, DTW and ZCPA. This paper deals with the combined techniques and its comparison with individual techniques. The rate of features extracted in joint extraction techniques gives promising results comparatively with individual technique. Techniques MFCC, MODGDF and ZCPA are combined, and joint features are extracted. The next stage is to classify the features where selected technique using neural networks. Features are classified by NTN and MNTN classifiers for speaker-dependent recognition and presented by using closed and open sets. The MNTN is evaluated for several speaker recognition experiments. These include closed- and open-set speaker identification and speaker verification. The MNTN is found to perform better than NTN classifier.

abstract={Today, clustering for Sensor Node (SN) is a method in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) to diminish the energy consumption of the SN by avoiding long distance communication between the SNs. This will protract the lifetime of sensor networks. However, a cluster head has to perform various tasks such as collection of data from member nodes, aggregation of the collected data, and send that data to the BS. Network load balance is a challenging issue in WSNs for the clustering schemes. Genetic algorithms (GA) with clustering schemes are implemented for better cluster formation. The GA run through again over a large no of iterations to find the optimal solution that leads to premature convergence. The chaotic GA (CGA) will solve this problem by avoiding local convergence, i.e., by choosing a chaotic map to generate the random values instead of traditional random function and improves the performance of the traditional GA. A chaotic GA (CGA) based clustering algorithm for WSNs has been proposed in the proposed work that has better convergence rate for cluster head selection and consequently improves the performance of sensor network. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is harmful to living organisms, causing damage to macromolecules such as DNA, RNA, proteins and lipids. Available inorganic and organic chemicals used in commercial sunscreen have deleterious activity in vivo. Therefore, there is a need of a safe and natural sunscreen. Cyanobacteria are the impressive source of natural products and they can be exploited industrially. Cyanobacteria synthesize the UV absorbing compounds like mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) and scytonemin. MAAs are water-soluble molecules (188 to 1050 Da) that absorb UV-A and UV-B radiation and disperse the energy as heat. Scytonemin is a lipid soluble pigment (544 Da) having absorption maxima at 380 nm. They are promising natural alternatives for both direct (UV-absorption) and indirect (antioxidant) protection. These molecules show strong photostability and do not have any cytotoxic effects. The search for natural UV protective molecules is relatively recent, providing two commercial products (Helioguard(r) and Helionori(r)) containing MAAs extract from red alga Porphyra umbilicalis. Still commercialization of potential photoprotective molecules is required for the development of a better and safe sunscreen. Therefore, for improvement in their expression levels, a complete understanding of biosynthetic pathway of MAAs and scytonemin is essential. Additionally, an economic and sustainable method for extraction of these molecules from cyanobacteria is also required for large-scale production. Future perspectives include the heterologous expression of MAAs and/or scytonemin in industrially friendly microorganisms in order to co-produce different UV protective molecules and thus cover a broader UV spectrum and simplify the production process. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

abstract={Technologies such as the integration of distributed generations (DGs) and shunt capacitors (SCs) are key for realising smart distribution systems. These technologies may be coordinated together to get better solutions so that distribution systems can achieve optimum performance. This study proposes a long-term distribution system planning methodology to determine the optimal sizing and siting of SCs and mix of dispatchable and intermittent DGs. More practical formulations are suggested while considering realities of modern distribution systems with reference to the stochastic nature of load demand and power generation among distribution buses on account of diversity, variability and uncertainty. The long-term costs in the proposed planning model include several techno-economic and social objectives pertaining to investment, operation and maintenance of these distributed resources and the revenue generated by sale of electricity to customers and the utility grid. The proposed planning model is more practical as it fully considers the system uncertainties and variability in load and power generation which are efficiently handled by introducing deterministic self-adaptive uncertainty model. The case study on a standard test distribution system being modified by wind turbines, photovoltaic generators and microturbines demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The results of study are investigated and presented. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2017},

In this study, a new method is proposed to determine the real-time transient stability status and identification of the coherent generator groups by predicting the rotor angle values following a large disturbance through radial basis function neural network. The first six cycles of synchronously sampled post-fault data measurements from PMUs consisting of rotor angles and voltages of generators are taken as the input to the neural network to predict the future state of the system.

abstract={Adverse drug reactions represent the unwanted or undesired effects of drugs. Timely extraction of such effects is highly required so that early warnings can be raised against if any serious beforehand to save patients from any further loss. It also helps in framing alternate treatment plan. There are two different ways for identifying the side effects of drugs. First is premarketing trials, which are conducted before floating drugs into market. But this approach is not as effective as these trials are carried out on a restricted population for restricted time. That is why another approach called as postmarketing surveillance is used. Under this approach, data mining techniques have been applied frequently for finding adverse reactions of drugs. But most of the existing techniques are based on the assumption that all attributes are equally responsible for drug side effects which may not be applicable for all real-life cases. In this paper, we study the role of different patients and drug attributes in manifestation of adverse drug reactions using clustering technique. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.},

abstract={This study has been conducted on mining areas of Gua and Banduhurang in Jharkhand State, India, Barbil in Orissa State, India and Mines d’Arlit, Niger. Data from the corresponding sensors of EO-I, LANDSAT and IRS (i.e., Hyperion, ETM+ and LISS III respectively) were used to discriminate satellite signals of Hematite and Uranium ores from these locations. For the data of Hyperion being hyper-spectral, correction mechanism were performed through relevant algorithms: Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Hypercube (FLAASH) to remove atmospheric aerosol effects, Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) to remove noise, Pixel Purity Index (PPI) to get spectrally the most pure pixel and Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) in order to match the spectral similarity between an image pixel spectrum and a referenced spectrum. The data achieved from ETM+ had line-stripping, and thus were restored. On the LISS III data, vegetation had to be, virtually, removed from the images of the Indian sites, using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), in order to equate them with that from the Niger site. The processed data was put to a common platform statistically. Segregation of Uranium, a radioactive ore, from Hematite, a non-radioactive iron ore, could be achieved up to 82.35% using TOPSIS and 90% using pair-wise Student’s t-Test. The technique of Band Ratio was also carried out and an index was generated to isolate these mines from their surroundings. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.},

Hence, Intrusion detection systems require efficient and improved detection mechanism which could detect intrusive activities and serious threat to network security. Nowadays, huge amount of data is flowing every second; hence intrusion detection task became tedious. In our research work, we have proposed a framework in which a feature reduction algorithm is used for reducing the less important features and then applied the supervised data mining techniques on UNSW-NB15network dataset for fast, efficient and accurate detection of intrusion in the Netflow records using Spark. In this paper, we have used two feature reduction algorithms, namely, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and seven well known classification algorithms. In order to compare the performance of the proposed framework, five performance matrices such as accuracy, Specificity, Kappa, Mean Abs.

abstract={A modified microbial polysaccharide based biopolymer has been investigated as a potential candidate towards development of sustainable biomaterials and bioplastics. An in-depth study was carried out to biosynthesize, characterize and assess any possible mutagenic potential and ecotoxicity of the microbial polysaccharide biopolymer. Microstructural investigations using confocal microscopy, Fourier transform (FT)-Raman depth profile mapping and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the biosynthetically modified polysaccharide revealed internal structural perturbations, as well as occlusion of granular pores by extraneous materials. The Raman 3D mapping depth profile along with time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry also indicated important structural and surface modifications, which could be correlated to the production of microbial exopolysaccharides and secondary metabolites. The study then looked into any possible genetic mutation and ecological risks associated with the biosynthetically modified polysaccharide through the investigation of genotoxicity and ecotoxicity. The genotoxicity study was carried out through bacterial reverse gene mutation (Ames) test by using two different strains (TA98 and TA100) of bacteria. The results did not indicate any mutagenic effect against either of the strains used for the biopolymer samples and was found to be genotoxically safe. Ecotoxicity tests, carried out using bioluminescent bacteria Vibrio fisheri further indicated no ecotoxicity within the given experimental conditions. The study measured the half maximal effective concentration (EC50) to cause a 50% decrease in the light output of the bacteria, a measure of ecotoxicological response of the biopolymer. Overall, results from this study indicated that the novel biopolymer was genotoxically and ecotoxically safe, which offers immense potential for future use of this biopolymer. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

Methods/Statistical analysis: The proposed bit cell is compared with conventional 6T bit cell for access time, read stability, on-current,and off-current, and the suitable sense amplifiers and decoder are analyzed. Findings: The proposed architecture for SRAM design meets the criteria of faster access time and read stability as compared to the conventional 6T SRAM. Write 1 operation achieves a rise of 16%, while write 0 and read 1 are better than 6T by 70 and 90%, respectively. The design was implemented on 28 nm FD-SOI platform.

abstract={In this paper, a single notched band at 5.2 GHz with complementary split ring resonator (CSRR) ultra-wideband (UWB) antenna and its implementation in designing of two-element multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) with high and uniform isolation are experimentally demonstrated. The proposed UWB MIMO consists of a T-shaped stub in ground plane in between antenna elements of the size of λat3.1 GHz/4 to achieve minimum 20 dB isolation, which is almost uniform in entire UWB band. The size of the UWB MIMO antenna is 0.31λat3.1 GHz × 0.434λat3.1 GHz × 0.008λat3.1 GHz mm3 , and it is printed on an RT/duroid 5880 substrate (εr = 2.2, tan δ = 0.0009), which leads to good gain and high total efficiency of the antenna in operating bands. The simulated and measured results show good agreement for the impedance bandwidth (|S11 | &lt; −10 dB) and isolation (|S21 | &lt; −20 dB) in most of the operating band, excluding the notched band at 5.2 GHz in UWB range. The simulated, measured and calculated MIMO antenna diversity parameters prove that the antenna is suitable for UWB MIMO systems. © 2018, Electromagnetics Academy. All rights reserved.},

abstract={When machine learning algorithms are applied to huge amount of data, we found difficulties to process such huge data. Now new approaches are being adopted because existing machine learning libraries doesnt have enough resources to process large datasets. So new libraries (CUDA, MapReduce, and Dryad) are adding up for concepts like parallel computing. Here we will take account of GraphLab, Apache MahoutTM, and Jubatus to get the exposure of famous academics and industrial results. Looking at the traditional machine learning techniques, tasks like to handle the data which is distributed identically or in batch mode becomes impossible and there is requirement to develop new algorithms to overcome with the existing difficulties faced by these traditional ML algorithms. The objective of this chapter is to provide overall view of developed algorithms and paradigm shifts of current big data analysis using machine learning approach to compute data. Here we will explore that the machine learning field has great impact on cloud computing paradigm. In first step we deploy various tool to the cloud like libraries and statistics tools. In second step we embed plugins with current tools in order to make Hadoop cluster on the cloud so that working programs can run on it. In third step libraries of machine learning algorithms are deployed and used for data intensive computing. © 2018 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In our day-to-day life, a system never works on the conditions specified while it was being designed. Hence, it becomes necessary to include the uncertainties present in these systems while obtaining the optimized conditions. These uncertainties present in a reliability model can be handled well if the probabilistic constraints of such models are satisfied. This paper is directed to handle these probabilistic constraints of a reliability-based design optimization model (RBDO). For this purpose, one of the most efficient and precise optimization tools, namely genetic algorithm (GA), has been used. The basic principle of GAs involves the combination of the fittest string structures which are generated through numerous random iterations. The main objective of this paper is to incorporate the efficient function of a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) in a code formulated in ‘C’ language which is designed in a manner such that it is capable to handle the probabilistic constraints of a RBDO model. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.},

abstract={This paper proposes a unique microstrip patch antenna which has a hexagonal fractal pattern which can mainly be used for ground based surveillance radar applications. To further optimize the functioning of the antenna, multiple slots have been added to the ground plane, and a stepped pattern has been implemented to increase the current density and the gain. A detailed study of the stages of development of the antenna has been made, illustrating the effect that various design elements have on the operating characteristics of the final design. There is specific emphasis on the use of slots in the ground plane. Variations in return loss, gain, VSWR, operating frequency and bandwidth with changes in the design of the ground plane have been documented. The antenna is designed to perform in the X-band, more specifically around 9 GHz, making it well suited for short range search. The final iteration of the antenna design, including various stages of slotting in the ground plane, works at 8.7 GHz, which is well within the X-band range, and has a return loss of around 30 dB. © 2018 Authors.},

Simulations and measurements show that the antenna which is designed in this paper has nearly omnidirectional radiation patterns on the transmission band and achieves a good gain, which enables it to be used for different UWB applications. It is designed using FR-4 (Lossy) substrate which is low cost and commercially available and the model is validated through extensive simulations performed in CST MWS 2014. The proposed design is achieved using 3 steps with each step resulting in a great enhancement in the bandwidth. The proposed antenna works for frequencies from 8 – 17.6 GHz resulting in a huge bandwidth of 9.6 GHz. The proposed antenna provides this huge bandwidth with a minimal size of 24×28 mm2.

abstract={Synthesis of mono-crystalline Ga2O3 Nanorods was done by sol-gel transformation of gallium(III) isopropoxide (Ga(OPri)3). XRD studies were done to determine the planes and crystal structure of synthesized nanorods that showed the synthesis of β-Ga2O3 (a). TEM studies of synthesized Ga2O3 confirmed the synthesis of monocrystalline β-Ga2O3 nanorods. To study the effect of precursor chemistry and to determine role of precursor structures on the crystal structure, phase and morphology of the Ga2O3, a new modified precursor complex was synthesized. The reaction of Ga(OPri)3 with N-phenylsalicylaldimine, [C6H4(OH)CH=N(C6H5)] in 1:1 M ratio yielded [{(H5C6)N = CH-C6H4O}Ga(OPri)2]. The newly synthesized complex was characterized by elemental analyses, molecular weight measurement, FT-IR and NMR (1H and 13C) spectral studies. Spectral studies of the modified complex suggest the presence of bi-dentate mode of attachment of Schiffs base in the solution state. Sol-gel transformations of [{(H5C6)N = CH-C6H4O}Ga(OPri)2] in organic medium, yielded γ-Ga2O3(b), as found by XRD studies. TEM image of the sample (a) revealed the formation of nano-rods of oxide with average diameter of ~100 nm whereas the TEM image of sample (b) showed presence of nano-sized particles of oxide with average particle size of 10 nm. Morphological and compositional studies of synthesized samples (a) and (b) were carried out using SEM and EDX.

abstract={The objective of this paper is to describe the technique of improvement of Ultra Wideband Antennas (UWB) and also how to design them. A simple design, a smaller structure and better return loss is expected from the antenna. The simulations show that that the antennas has a good amplification factor and a nearly omnidirectional properties in the proposed bandwidth region. The substrate used in the designing of this antenna is FR-4 (Lossy) which is a low cost substrate and the designs were simulated extensively using the CST MWS 2014. The progression in the design of this antenna is shown through three successive iterations which progressively further enhances the desired result The final bandwidth in the third iteration operates in the frequency range 3.28-20GHz resulting in a bandwidth of 16.72GHz. The size of the substrate used in this antennas is 25x30 mm2. The results show that the proposed antenna can operate in C Band (4 GHz to 8 GHz), X Band (8 GHz-12GHz) and Ku-Band (12 GHz to 18GHz).

abstract={Background: Human height is a classic polygenic trait and currently available data explains only 10% of the phenotypic variation in height. Almost 60%-80% of the children coming to pediatric and endocrinology outpatient department for the evaluation of short stature are still labeled as idiopathic. Objectives: The aim of this study is to identify various chromosomal alterations causing idiopathic short stature (ISS) and short stature with dysmorphic features not pertaining to known genetic syndromes. Materials and Methods: After exclusion of all nutritional, systemic, endocrine, and syndromic causes of short stature, 19 patients with height <2 standard deviation scores were subjected to chromosomal microarray (CMA) study using Affymetrix CytoScan 750K array and CMA Scanner 3000 platform. Results: We identified total 61 copy-number variant (CNV) and polymorphs (33 gains, 11 loss, and 17 gain-mosaics) not described as normal variants in database of genomic variations. We identified SHOX haploinsufficiency as a cause of short stature in two patients, whereas one patient was gain-mosaic for SHOX. All three had normal conventional karyotype. One of these patients also had deletion of PAX3, which could be the cause of both short stature and associated mild intellectual impairment in this patient. We also found a long noncoding RNA, namely, KIAA0125 and a pseudogene ADAM6 in 18 out of our 19 patients which might have a regulatory role. Conclusion: This study shows that CMA is a very promising tool for the identification of pathogenic CNVs in patients with ISS. It can also help to identify novel genes controlling height and can open up new insight into pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying ISS, and thus may help to unfold new therapeutic targets for treatment of this condition. The association of CNV having genes for long noncoding RNAs, such as KIAA0125 and pseudogene such as ADAM6 with ISS suggest that they may play a role in controlling the expression of height-related genes and it needs further investigations. © 2018 Indian Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism.},

abstract={Over the years, a large array of multimedia services started using mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) due to its attractive features such as low-cost quick deployment, node mobility, and distributed networking. However, multimedia applications also require provisioning of adequate quality of service (QoS) to enhance quality of experience (QoE) of end users. In order to provide QoS in a network, the accurate knowledge of the remaining network resources at any time is the key. But, due to the inherent characteristics of MANETs such as dynamic topology, high bit-error-rate communication channels, and decentralized control, estimating remaining network resources is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel remaining bandwidth estimation algorithm which considers the node (or link) mobility into consideration while performing dynamic bandwidth estimation on a node. The estimated link bandwidth value is then used during the route discovery process to select routes with adequate bandwidth and thus increases the QoS of the data flow. The proposed algorithm is verified using real-time video traffic (i.e., H.264/SVC encoded video traces) using a industry standard simulator called Qualnet. The simulation results show that the proposed approach increases the decision accuracy of the soft admission control process and thus leads to the enhancement of the quality of the received video traffic. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

This antenna basically covers the industrial, scientific and medical band (ISM 2.45 GHz) which can be used for wearable applications in the field of health care and telemetry. In particular, designing and analysis are focused on the performance of a miniaturized square-shaped spiral cut MSPA for body centric wireless communication.

abstract={The authentication models are utilized among the various network based applications, between various homogeneous and heterogeneous network appliances, Internet of things (IoT) applications, Healthcare applications, etc. The authentication models relies upon the encryption models for the protection of data during the propagation of the keys over the communication media. A weak encryption method may lower the security level of authentication model. The complex encryption models are also considered slower, which eventually increase the authentication delay and decreases the overall performance of authentication models. In this paper, a robust, quick and complex encryption model has been proposed model, which have been defined as the parallel partial model (PPM). The PPM algorithm is capable of keeping the higher level security, while decreased the authentication delay. The PPM method collaborates the improved Advanced Encryption Standard (iAES) and modified Elliptic Curve Cryptography (mECC) to fulfill the need to secure and quick encryption algorithm. The proposed model has been undergone various experimental scenarios, where it has been found improved than the existing model in the terms of bit difference, overall time and average time. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Carbon to nitrogen ratio (C/N) is not the lone limiting factors in biological nutrient removal from municipal wastewaters, but readily biodegradable to slowly biodegradable COD ratio (rbCOD/sbCOD) inter alia governs the process of nutrient removal. An intermittent aeration pre-anoxic sequencing batch reactor was operated at C/N ratio of 3, 7.5, and 10 and at rbCOD/sbCOD ratios of 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5 at different sludge internal recirculation ratios. The increasing trend in nitrogen removal was observed with above mentioned operating parameters. At high C/N and rbCOD/sbCOD ratio of 10 and 0.5 the maximum total nitrogen (TN) removal was 90.7% giving 3.8 mg/L TN in the effluent out of 30 mg/L in the influent. At average sewage quality consisting of C/N and rbCOD/sbCOD ratio of 7.5 and 0.25; the TN removal was not more than 83%. The specific nitrate removal rate varied from 0.010 to 0.022 gNO3 -/gVSSa.d (0.015 ± 0.0013) at C/N ratio of 3.0, 0.013–0.018 gNO3 -/gVSSa.d (0.017 ± 0.0011) at 7.5 and 0.013–0.015 gNO3 -/gVSSa.d (0.014 ± 0.001) at 10. The increase in specific nitrate removal rate was coherent to high rbCOD/sbCOD ratio but as the C/N increased to 10 this effect was nullified. The result conformed to defined stoichiometric model based on C/N, rbCOD/sbCOD and sludge internal recirculation ratios. It will help in further effluent polishing with respect to nutrient removal to achieve desired treated wastewater quality. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Three dyes based on a triphenylamine (TPA) moiety using a silicon bridge have been synthesised, namely CL-1D, CL-OMe and CL-SiMe. Structural benefits of long alkyl chains and electron donor group on photo conversion efficiency (PCE) of dye sensitized solar cells is discussed. A previously synthesised dye, denoted CL-1, which contained long alkyl chains and exhibited an efficiency of 6.90%, was compared with CL-SiMe, which contained shorter alkyl chains and showed and efficiency of 3.41%. A large drop in Jsc and Voc was found to be the reason for the appreciable decline in efficiency for CL-SiMe vis-à-vis CL-1. Electron donor group studies were performed using CL-1D and CL-OMe. CL-1D, which contained bulky aniline electron donor groups, showed an efficiency of 4.20%, whilst CL-OMe, featuring smaller methoxy donor groups had an efficiency of 5.50%. Theoretical UV–Vis absorption spectra were obtained for the CL-1D dye by time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT); the experimental and calculated values of the energy for maximum absorbance were in good agreement with experimental data. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

A simple and efficient face recognition approach based on Gabor phase pattern and Self Organizing Maps is presented here. Histogram of Gabor Phase Pattern is used in proposed approach for feature extraction and Self Organizing maps are used as a classifier to identify whether the given grayscale image belongs to a particular class or not. In contrast to other feature extraction techniques, faster results are obtained using Histogram of Gabor Phase Patterns as feature detection occurs automatically without the need of any training procedure. A series of extensive experiments performed on various databases on MATLAB shows that proposed approach achieved a recognition rate of 97.33%, 96.49% and 94.20% for 7 consecutive trials on ORL, YALE and JAFFE databases respectively. It is demonstrated through experimental results that the proposed approach yields significant gain in terms of computational simplicity and effective accuracy. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={This study showcases the potential of unnatural amino acids to enable non-natural functions when incorporated in the protein scaffold of heme metalloproteins. For this purpose, a genetically-engineered myoglobin (Mb) mutant was created by incorporating redox-active 3-amino-L-tyrosine (NH2Tyr) into its active site, replacing the distal histidine (H64) with NH2Tyr. In peroxide-shunt assays, this variant exhibits an increased rate of turnover for thioanisole and benzaldehyde oxidation as compared to the wild-type (WT) Mb. Indeed, in the presence of excess hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a 9-fold and 81-fold increase in activity was observed over multiple turnovers for thioanisole sulfoxidation and benzoic acid formation, respectively. The increased oxidation activity in the H64NH2Tyr Mb mutant underlined the role of NH2Tyr in the distal active-site scaffold in peroxide activation. Kinetic, electrochemical, and EPR spectroscopic experiments were performed. On the basis of these studies, it is argued that the single NH2Tyr residue within the Mb variant simultaneously serves the role of the conserved His/Arg-pair within the distal pocket of horseradish peroxidase. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The Level of Repair Analysis (LORA) and Spare Parts Provisioning (SPP) are the major maintenance planning decisions which have a direct impact on the Life Cycle Cost (LCC) of a capital intensive system. Such capital intensive systems are comprised of a considerable number of assemblies/sub-assemblies, which need to undergo optimized maintenance actions, proving to be beneficial for them. Employing heuristic methods can yield faster results which can converge to the global optimum. This research consists of an integrated approach which simultaneously optimizes the level of repair and spare parts decisions for fleet systems. This study uses the memetic algorithm to yield appropriate results for this complex combinatorial problem. It also draws a comparison of the results obtained by the memetic algorithm with those obtained by genetic algorithm. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Oxime-modified aluminium(III) isopropoxide, [Al(OiPr){ONC(CH3)2}2] was used as a sol-gel precursor to deposit alumina film on steel substrate by dip coating method. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the above compound indicates its clean one step decomposition to alumina at low temperature, making it a suitable spray pyrolysis deposition (SPD) precursor for deposition of alumina film over steel at 400 °C. The formed alumina films (dip and spray coated) were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopic (EDX) techniques. The XRD patterns of the films suggest deposition of amorphous alumina films while the FTIR and EDX analyses indicate the presence of alumina film on steel substrate. SEM images of coated samples indicate deposition of crack-free alumina films. The thickness of alumina films (dip and spray coated) were found to be in the range of ~ 1.4 ± 0.2 μm as indicated by their cross sectional views. The corrosion protection of the deposited alumina films has been checked by the electrochemical studies; open circuit potential (OCP), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and potentiodynamic polarization. The electrochemical studies suggest corrosion resistive nature of the alumina film in 3.5% (w/v) NaCl solution. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Electro-osmotic peristaltic transport of aqueous nanofluids in a two-dimensional micro-channel is examined analytically. Such flows arise in bio-mimetic pumping systems at the very small scale of interest in physiological treatment e.g. occular drug delivery systems. Complex waveforms are imposed at the walls to mimic sophisticated peristaltic wave propagation scenarios. Nano-particles are assumed to be in local thermal equilibrium. Joule electro-thermal heating is included. The dimensional conservation equations are linearized and transformed from the wave to the fixed (laboratory) frame under lubrication theory approximations. The emerging dimensionless model features a number of important thermo-physical, electrical and nanoscale parameter, namely thermal and solutal (basic density) Grashof numbers, nanoscale Brownian motion parameter, thermophoresis parameter, Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity (maximum electro-osmotic velocity), Debye electrokinetic length and Joule heating to surface heat flux ratio. Closed-form solutions are derived for the nano-particle volume fraction, temperature, axial velocity, averaged volumetric flow rate, pressure difference across one wavelength, skin friction (wall shear stress function), Nusselt number (wall heat transfer rate) and stream function distribution in the wave frame. The influence of selected parameters on these flow variables is studied with the aid of graphs. Bolus formation is also visualized and streamline distributions are observed to be strongly influenced and asymmetric in nature. © 2017 The Society of Powder Technology Japan},

abstract={Metal-halide perovskites are rapidly emerging crystalline materials that are reasonably preferred as leading aspirant for applications in optoelectronic and thermoelectric devices. In this paper, we have thoroughly reviewed and performed calculations to reveal optoelectronic and transport properties for a potential newcomer, Cs2PdX6 (X = Cl, Br) termed as Cesium Palladium Halides (CPH). Outcome of present computations are compared with available results and a reasonable agreement is recorded. Energy band gap computations performed reveal indirect band gap of 2.29 eV for Cs2PdCl6, which substantially reduces to 1.22 eV when ‘Cl’ is replaced by ‘Br’. Optical absorption spectra investigations performed here, in the energy range from 3 to 5 eV confirms effective utilization of these compounds in solar cells and other optoelectronic applications. In addition, the transport properties computations performed using semi-classical Boltzmann theory, shows constant pattern of thermo power near ambient temperature range (200–500 K), which admits possible utilization of these compounds as low temperature thermoelectric materials. Performed ZT calculations demonstrates reasonably good thermoelectric performance for both materials, as there exist minor variation (0.1) in the values over wide temperature ranges i.e. from 100 to 800 K. Further, detailed analysis of transport properties predicts p-type semiconducting nature of the present series of materials. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Moringa oleifera Lam. (vern. Drumstick) is a mineral rich, medicinally important tree species of family Moringaceae. It has a wide range of culinary applications and has bioremediation, nutritional and medicinal properties. Conventionally, seeds of the tree have been used as natural coagulants and flocculents in waste water treatment. Its leaves and bark act as biosorbent for remediation of heavy metals and dyes. The tree provides remedies for a range of diseases and disorders by dint of its unique combination of numerous phytochemicals. Gum exudates of the tree are of immense medicinal importance due to their applications in biodegradable drug delivery systems and in treatment of asthma, dysentery and intestinal cancer. The multidimensional utilities of M. oleifera may cause overexploitation of this tree, posing danger to the existing natural variability in the near future. Therefore, there is a need for conservation of the species for ethnobotanical, pharmacological, nutraceutical and biodiversity purposes. Development of tissue culture propagation methods will assist in preserving some of the germplasm of the species. In the present review, consolidated analysis of the role of biotechnology in conservation and genetic enhancement of nutritional, medicinal and commercial value of the tree has been placed in perspective, together with an up to date review on phytochemical analysis of the plant, and its utility has been discussed to invite the attention of the scientific community to further consider the study of this miracle tree species and its nutritional and pharmaceutical properties. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH},

abstract={While extracting land cover from remote sensing images, each pixel in the image is allocated to one of the possible class. In reality different land covers within a pixel can be found due to continuum of variation in landscape and intrinsic mixed nature of most classes. Mixed pixels may not be appropriately processed by traditional image classifiers, which assume that pixels are pure. The existence of mixed pixels led to the development of several approaches for soft (often termed fuzzy in the remote sensing literature) classification in which each pixel is allocated to all classes in varying proportions. However, while the proportions of each land cover within each pixel may be predicted, the spatial location of each land cover within each pixel is not. Thus, it is important to develop and implement a classifier that can work as soft classifiers for landslide identification. This work is an attempt to document and identify landslide areas by five spectral indices using temporal multi-spectral images from IRS-P6 LISS-IV images. To improve the spectral properties of spectral indices for specific class identification (in this case landslide) a Class Based Sensor Independent (CBSI) technique proposed. The result indicates that CBSI based Transformed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (TNDVI) temporal indices data gives better results for landslide identification with minimum entropy and membership range. © Authors 2018.

Steganography, which means shrouded composing, is the procedure of hiding mystery data into another cover-media, for example, sound, video, Image and content, in such a way, to the point that the very presence of the data is disguised. In this paper, steganographic methods for computerized Images, which are utilized as a cover media, are examined and dissected. An amended steganographic strategy with information concealing strategies are proposed so the concealing limit can be amplified without bringing about noticeable corruption in the Image quality and the installed mystery information can be recuperated accurately without referencing the first cover-Image. © 2017 IEEE.},

In this paper, Optimal PMU Placement (OPP) problem is solved to obtain the complete observability of power system with minimum number of PMUs under normal and abnormal operating conditions. The proposed OPP problem determines coordinated observability considering multiple contingency cases: single line outage, double line outage resulting in bus isolation, single PMU loss resulting in communication failure. Integer Linear Programming (ILP) is used to determine optimal number and locations for OPP problem. Moreover, Optimal PMU placement problem with conventional measurements is modified for incorporation of bus isolation caused due to contingency. The effectiveness of proposed methodology has been tested on IEEE 14-bus system and New England 39-bus power system. The results highlight the practical suitability of the proposed approach at the control centers. © 2017 IEEE.},

The proposed power saving technique includes the efficient use of proper line cards (LC) and adaptive link rate (ALR) mechanism at optical line terminal located at the central office. In the presence of low traffic, ALR switches link rate from 10 to 1 Gbps depending on the particular threshold value of traffic load. In the presence of narrowband traffic, a significant amount of energy is saved. Proposed architecture also saves capital expenditure (CAPEX) at remote node and reduces significant CAPEX for larger networks.

abstract={The transportation of biological and industrial nanofluids by natural propulsion like cilia movement and self-generated contraction-relaxation of flexible walls has significant applications in numerous emerging technologies. Inspired by multi-disciplinary progress and innovation in this direction, a thermo-fluid mechanical model is proposed to study the entropy generation and convective heat transfer of nanofluids fabricated by the dispersion of single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) nanoparticles in water as the base fluid. The regime studied comprises heat transfer and steady, viscous, incompressible flow, induced by metachronal wave propulsion due to beating cilia, through a cylindrical tube containing a sparse (i.e., high permeability) homogenous porous medium. The flow is of the creeping type and is restricted under the low Reynolds number and long wavelength approximations. Slip effects at the wall are incorporated and the generalized Darcy drag-force model is utilized to mimic porous media effects. Cilia boundary conditions for velocity components are employed to determine analytical solutions to the resulting non-dimensionalized boundary value problem. The influence of pertinent physical parameters on temperature, axial velocity, pressure rise and pressure gradient, entropy generation function, Bejan number and stream-line distributions are computed numerically. A comparative study between SWCNT-nanofluids and pure water is also computed. The computations demonstrate that axial flow is accelerated with increasing slip parameter and Darcy number and is greater for SWCNT-nanofluids than for pure water. Furthermore the size of the bolus for SWCNT-nanofluids is larger than that of the pure water. The study is applicable in designing and fabricating nanoscale and microfluidics devices, artificial cilia and biomimetic micro-pumps. © 2018, China Ship Scientific Research Center.},

The possibilities of oxidation of fabricated graphene based nano electronic devices may change the device characteristics, which motivates to further explore the properties of graphene oxide nanoribbons (GONRs). Therefore, we present a systematic computational study on the spin polarized transport in surface oxidized GNR in antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin configuration using density functional theory combined with non-equilibrium Greens function (NEGF) method. It is found that the conductance in oxidized GNRs is significantly suppressed in the valance band and the conduction band. A further reduction in the conductance profile is seen in presence of two oxygen atoms on the ribbon plane. This change in the conductance may be attributed to change in the surface topology of the ribbon basal plane due to presence of the oxygen adatoms, where the charge transfer take place between the ribbon basal plane and the oxygen atoms. © 2018 Author(s).},

abstract={The Bloch-Siegert shift is a phenomenon in quantum optics, typically seen in two-level systems, when the driving field is sufficiently strong. The inclusion of frequency doubling effect (counter rotating term) in the conventional rotating wave approximation (RWA) changes the resonance condition thereby producing a rather small shift in the resonance condition, which is known as the Bloch-Siegert shift (BSS). Rabi oscillations in Dirac-Weyl fermionic systems exhibit anomalous behavior far from resonance, called anomalous Rabi oscillations. Therefore, in the present work, we study the phenomenon of the Bloch-Siegert shift in Weyl semimetal and topological insulator (TI) far from resonance, called anomalous Bloch-Siegert shift (ABSS). It is seen that the change in the resonance condition of anomalous Rabi oscillations is drastic in Weyl semimetal and TI. The ABSS in Weyl semimetals is highly anisotropic, whereas it is isotropic in TI. In case of TI, it is the Chern number which plays a crucial role to produce substantial change in the ABSS. © 2018 Author(s).},

abstract={This paper aims to analyze the electroosmotic flow of non-Newtonian ionic nanoliquids in presence of peristaltic propulsion. A geometric model is employed for a microfluidic tapered channel flow regime. Williamsons fluid model is utilized to characterize non-Newtonian nature of the base fluid. The normalized governing equations are reduced with lubrication approximations (long wavelength and low Reynolds number assumptions). Poisson-Boltzmann equation is also simplified by using Debye-Hückel linearization. No slip conditions are imposed at the channel walls. The analytical solutions are obtained for temperature field and nanoparticle volume fraction. However, a perturbation method is used to find out an approximate solution for axial velocity, pressure rise and volumetric flow rate. The perturbation solutions are further graphically illustrated with MATLAB software. The perturbation solution is also validated with numerical results simulated by MATLAB coding through BVP command. The effects of thermal radiation and non-Newtonian parameters on flow characteristics, pumping characteristics, wall shear stress and trapping phenomenon are discussed.

abstract={Rheum emodi is a Himalayan herb of family Polygonaceace, known for its medicinal properties owing to the presence of chrysophanol, emodin, physcion, aloe emodi anthraquinones as major constituents. The present investigation aims to synthesize TiO2 nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs) using R. emodi root extract. The synthesized nanoparticles were characterized using UV–Vis, FTIR, FESEM, EDX, AFM, TEM and XRD techniques. UV–visible spectra indicated the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) at 336 nm. The size distribution profiles were analyzed through XRD which revealed the crystalline nature of nanoparticles with average size of 45 nm. TEM and SEM micrographs showed that the particles are spherical and uneven. FTIR spectra reflected the evidence of the presence of anthraquinones, possible bio-molecules responsible for stabilization, reduction and capping of TiO2 NPs. The cytotoxic potential of TiO2 NPs was tested against liver cancer cells (HepG2) lines which was found very effective and the formulation can be used in nano-drug to treat cancer cells in future. © 2018 Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei},

The proposed approach primarily mitigates the congestion based on rescheduling both the real and reactive power output of generators. The severe transmission congestion problem may be handled by adopting group wise load curtailment scheme based on willingness to pay approach in addition to real and reactive generation rescheduling. The separate bids are invited from all participating generators in the congestion market. Further, the multi-objective optimization frameworks are developed which simultaneously minimizes two contradictory objective functions such as Total Cost of Congestion Management and Congestion Severity Index (CSI) subjected to various system constraints.

abstract={Early rapid detection of Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) bacilli in milk samples is the major challenge since traditional culture method is time consuming and laboratory dependent. We report a simple, sensitive and specific nano-technology based ‘Nano-immuno test’ capable of detecting viable MAP bacilli in the milk samples within 10 h. Viable MAP bacilli were captured by MAP specific antibody-conjugated magnetic nano-particles using resazurin dye as chromogen. Test was optimized using true culture positive (10-bovine and 12-goats) and true culture negative (16-bovine and 25-goats) raw milk samples. Domestic livestock species in India are endemically infected with MAP. After successful optimization, sensitivity and specificity of the ‘nano-immuno test’ in goats with respect to milk culture was 91.7% and 96.0%, respectively. Whereas, it was 90.0% (sensitivity) and 92.6% (specificity) with respect to IS900 PCR. In bovine milk samples, sensitivity and specificity of ‘nano-immuno test’ with respect to milk culture was 90.0% and 93.7%, respectively. However, with respect to IS900 PCR, the sensitivity and specificity was 88.9% and 94.1%, respectively. Test was validated with field raw milk samples (goats-258 and bovine-138) collected from domestic livestock species to detect live/viable MAP bacilli. Of 138 bovine raw milk samples screened by six diagnostic tests, 81 (58.7%) milk samples were positive for MAP infection in one or more than one diagnostic tests. Of 81 (58.7%) positive bovine raw milk samples, only 24 (17.4%) samples were detected positive for the presence of viable MAP bacilli. Of 258 goats raw milk samples screened by six diagnostic tests, 141 (54.6%) were positive for MAP infection in one or more than one test. Of 141 (54.6%) positive raw milk samples from goats, only 48 (34.0%) were detected positive for live MAP bacilli. Simplicity and efficiency of this novel ‘nano-immuno test’ makes it suitable for wide-scale screening of milk samples in the field. Standardization, validation and re-usability of functionalized nano-particles and the test was successfully achieved in field samples. Test was highly specific, simple to perform and easy to read by naked eyes and does not require laboratory support in the performance of test. Test has potential to be used as screening test to estimate bio-load of MAP in milk samples at National level. © 2018 Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature},

abstract={In this article, the design and performance of circular radiating patch element with two U-shaped slots and defected ground plane, comprising of a triangular notch monopole structure with rhomboid shape resonator, is reported. The proposed multiband antenna has a compact structure design for GSM 1800 MHz, WLAN, WiMAX and UWB communication systems. The antenna is designed on FR4 glass epoxy substrate of size 39 mm × 34 mm × 1.59 mm by using computer simulation tool CST Microwave Studio 2014. For confirmation of simulation results, prototypes are fabricated and their performance is tested in free space. Measured results demonstrate that fabricated antenna provides triple bands with impedance bandwidth of 157 MHz (1.733 GHz to 1.89 GHz), 3.2 GHz (2.29 GHz to 5.49 GHz) & 10.45 GHz (6.83 GHz to 17.28 GHz), almost flat high gain between 4 to 6 dBi and good radiation patterns in the desired frequency range. The maximum measured gain of proposed structure is close to 6.59 dBi at 4.40 GHz. The circular polarization is also realized in the frequency range 4.12 GHz to 5.20 GHz with axial impedance bandwidth 1.08 GHz. The specific absorption rate SAR values of proposed design are also evaluated at various frequency spots which are well within the SAR values specified by the FCC. Proposed design may be proved a useful structure for advance radio communications systems as well as for the present requirements in defence applications. © School of Engineering, Taylor’s University.},

The moisture absorption results show that with an increase in weight percentage (from 0.1 to wt 1.5%) of OMMT within the bio polymer films, the absorption value of bio-nanocomposite films reduced rapidly from 34.4% to 22.3%. The density of hybrid composites also increased with increase in weight percentage of OMMT. The swelling characteristic of PCL increased with increasing % of OMMT clay.

abstract={The energy harnessing is a process of obtaining energy from the surrounding environment and converting into electrical energy. In the last two decades, there has been a plenteous study in energy harnessing. Now a day, energy harnessing using piezoelectric materials has drawn attention of researchers due to low cost, flexibility and light weight. The benefits of piezoelectric material can be utilized by designing a self-powered device for artificial nanoswimmer. Some of the ceramics which displays the piezoelectric effect are lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT), lead-titanate (PbTiO2), lead-zirconate (PbZrO3) and Barium Titanate (BaTiO3). PZT is most extensively used piezoelectric material in the field of energy harnessing but it is brittle in nature. Lead based piezoelectric materials are toxic in nature and may not suitable for in-vivo biomedical applications. To eradicate this problem, researchers are interested in synthesizing lead free piezoelectric material such as Aluminium Nitride (AIN), Barium Titanate (BaTiO3) and Polyvinylidenefluoride (PVDF). The biocompatibility of PVDF makes it appropriate to be used for energy harnessing in human body for applications like on board powering of nanoswimmer for various disease detection and drug delivery. In this paper, a cantilever beam is being simulated in COMSOL to study electric potential generated on the surface of beam made of different piezoelectric materials such as AIN, PVDF and PZT due to fluidic pressure, which will be utilized as energy for actuation of artificial nanoswimmer. Piezo-based cantilever beams have been compared and maximum electric potential is being observed in PVDF based beam. PVDF seems most promising piezoelectric material for in-vivo biomedical application and it is readily available. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

An externally applied static axial electrical field is imposed on the system. The Poisson-Boltzmann equation for electrical potential distribution is implemented to accommodate the electrical double layer in the microvascular regime. With long wavelength, lubrication and Debye-Hückel approximations, the boundary value problem is rendered non-dimensional. Analytical solutions are derived for the axial velocity, volumetric flow rate, pressure gradient, volumetric flow rate, averaged volumetric flow rate along one time period, pressure rise along one wavelength and stream function. A plug swidth is featured in the solutions. Via symbolic software (Mathematica), graphical plots are generated for the influence of Bingham plug flow width parameter, electrical Debye length and Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity (maximum electro-osmotic velocity) on the key hydrodynamic variables. This study reveals that blood flow rate accelerates with decreasing the plug width (i.e. viscoplastic nature of fluids) and also with increasing the Debye length parameter. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

We have been able to achieve an increase of around 8% in electrical conductivity of the form wires repeatedly. It has been observed that there was gradual improvement in the properties with reinforcement of MWCNT in the copper matrix. The betterment of electrical property has been achieved with simultaneous improvement in mechanical properties of the wire. The yield strength of MWCNT/Cu composite wire was found to be four times and the tensile strength two times greater than that of pure copper. The improved properties are attributed to the proper distribution of MWCNTs in the copper matrix and excellent interfacial bonding between MWCNT and composite copper fabricated by the modified method. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Synthetic dye (coracryl blue C5G) solution treated with immobilized crude enzyme on alginate beads showed a maximum net decolourization up to 55% (flow rate 1 ml/min). The U-tube bioreactor was more efficient in decolorizing the dye, which showed a net decolourization up to 64% at faster flow rate (2.5 ml/min). The decolorization efficiency in both the systems was positively influenced by the slower flow rate.

abstract={In most of the medical therapies, electromagnetic field plays important role to modulate the blood flow and to reduce the pain of human body. With this fact, this paper presents a mathematical model to study the peristaltic blood flow through porous microvessels in the presence of electrohydrodynamics. The effects of Joule heating and different zeta potential are also considered. Darcy law is employed for porous medium. The mathematical analysis is carried out in the form of electroosmosis, flow analysis and heat transfer analysis. Velocity slip conditions are imposed to solve momentum equation and thermal energy equation. Time dependent volumetric flow rate is considered which varies exponentially. Closed form solutions for potential function is obtained under Debye-Hückel approximation and velocity and temperature fields are obtained under low Reynolds number and large wavelength approximations. The influence of Hartmann number, electroosmotic parameter, slip parameters, Zeta potential, and couple stress parameter on flow characteristics, pumping characteristics and trapping phenomenon is computed. The effects of thermal slip parameters, Joule heating parameter, and Brinkman number on heat transfer characteristics are also presented graphically. Finally, the effect of Brinkman number on a graph between Nusselt number and Joule heating parameter is examined. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Graphene, topological insulators (TI) and the Weyl semimetal are shown to be well-characterized using the phenomenon of anomalous Rabi oscillation (ARO). These oscillations occur far from conventional resonance and Floquet theory shows them to be unique to these systems. Of particular interest is the bulk topological insulator (TI) where the wave-vector dependent frequency of the ARO is seen to be gapped in topologically trivial situations and gapless when there is a non-vanishing Chern number. It is shown that the Chern number may be directly inferred by performing a pump-probe experiment in the bulk without referring to surface states. A simpler alternative to the Lindblad method is invoked in order to incorporate dephasing effects that despite leading to a non-unitary time evolution of the wave-function, is nevertheless, probability conserving. The differential transmission coefficient versus the pump pulse duration (when all else is held fixed) has the form of a sinusoidal function with an amplitude that decays as a power law in the pump duration (alternatively, the “area” of the pump pulse). The exponent of this power law decay is indicative of the Chern number of the bulk in case of TI and more generally indicative of the particular member of the family of materials that may be collectively referred to as – Dirac-Weyl materials. © 2018, EDP Sciences, SIF, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={An analytical analysis is presented in this work to assess the influence of micropolar nature of fluids in fully developed flow induced by electrokinetically driven peristaltic pumping through a parallel plate microchannel. The walls of the channel are assumed as sinusoidal wavy to analyze the peristaltic flow nature. We consider that the wavelength of the wall motion is much larger as compared to the channel width to validate the lubrication theory. To simplify the Poisson Boltzmann equation, we also use the Debye-Hückel linearization. We consider governing equation for micropolar fluid in absence of body force and couple effects however external electric field is employed. The solutions for axial velocity, spin velocity, flow rate, pressure rise, and stream functions subjected to given physical boundary conditions are computed. The effects of pertinent parameters like Debye length and Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity which characterize the EDL phenomenon and external electric field, coupling number and micropolar parameter which characterize the micropolar fluid behavior, on peristaltic pumping are discussed through the illustrations. The results show that peristaltic pumping may alter by applying external electric fields. This model can be used to design and engineer the peristalsis-lab-on-chip and micro peristaltic syringe pumps for biomedical applications. © 2018, Korean Society of Rheology (KSR) and the Australian Society of Rheology (ASR) and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Transition metal substituted Zinc oxide (ZnO) has drawn a great deal of attention due to its excellent properties. Zn0.9Mn0.05Fe0.05O sample synthesized was by Sol-gel wet chemical precipitation route at temperature 350°C. The crystallinity and the structure of Zn0.9Mn0.05Fe0.05O was determined by X-ray diffraction by Cu-Kα radiations operated at 40kV and 35mA in the range of 20° to 80°. The pattern gets indexed in wurtzite (hexagonal) structure with lattice constants a=b=3.2525Å and c=5.2071Å and approves the single phase material with no impurity. The values of particle size assessed by Debye Scherers (DS) formula lie in the range of 13nm to 33nm indicating the nano-crystalline nature of the sample. The morphological analysis of the sample was performed by Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements. The observed size of Zn0.9Mn0.05Fe0.05O nanoparticles by TEM micrograph exhibits the similar trend with the size calculated by Debye-Scherer formula. TEM image show the irregular shape of the nanoparticles and particle size lies in the range of 10-35nm.

abstract={Progressive Visual Cryptography (PVC) is quite suitable for sharing sensitive digital data. Previous research on PVC, such as Fang et al. (2006) and W.P.Fang et al.(2008) were all carrying pixel-expansion problem and also gives a poor visual quality on the recovered stacked image. Recently, Hou & Quan (2011) have developed a progressive scheme for secret sharing. It is observed that shares generated by the scheme are free from pixel expansion problem, but shares are not fully secure. In this paper, a new progressive sharing algorithm based on logistic chaotic map has been proposed to overcome the said limitation of Hou (2011) scheme. The irregular outputs of the logistic map are used to encode a secret digital information carrying image. The performance of the algorithm in the scheme of Hou (2011) is critically analyzed and compared with new suggested scheme. Empirical results are presented to showcase the performance of the authors proposed scheme in terms of its effectiveness (imperceptibility and security) and feasibility. © 2018 by IGI Global.
