abstract={In present article an optimal policy is well established for advertisement schemes with preservation technology inputs. The items are deteriorating in nature and are stored at two-warehousing system. The demand is function of advertising frequency and selling price. In stock out situation partially backlogged shortages are inculcated to make the model more general. The advertising frequency, preservation cost are treated as main decision variables in development of the optimal cost function. Whole study is done under the effect of inflation over a finite time planning horizon.

abstract={This study reports the instantaneous synthesis of stable silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) at room temperature using a digallate (DG) derivative linked through hydrophilic oxyethylene spacer. The DG derivative was synthesized using standard ester coupling reaction and employed for the production of AgNPs. The Digallate acted as a very strong reducing and stabilizing agent as it reduced Ag ions in an aqueous media into Ag nanoparticles (DG-AgNPs) instantaneously at room temperature. The DG-AgNPs were characterized by UV/Vis, XPS, XRD, HR-TEM, SEM, AFM, DLS and zeta potential measurements and were evaluated for their antibacterial potential against four different strains (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptomyces griseus and Bacillus subtilis). It demonstrated strong inhibitory activity with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) ranging from 4.0-6.0 μg/ml against all the tested bacterial strains. Optical density (OD) measurements and live/dead cell staining assay revealed significant antibacterial action of DG-AgNPs. The MTT based cytotoxicity, cellular morphology and nuclear staining analysis of NIH 3T3 cells (fibroblasts) suggested DG-AgNPs to be relatively safe as it did not reveal any growth inhibition for the optimized antibacterial concentrations. Concisely, relatively non-toxic AgNPs have been produced rapidly at room temperature using dimeric gallate and suggested as effective and promising antibacterial agent for pharmaceutical applications. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

abstract={Aspect Ratio (Depth/Width) is one of the most important factor to determine the quality of weld. For a weld to be a perfect one the Aspect Ratio should be maximum. Hence to get a perfect weld one has to ensure that the depth of penetration is good enough. In the current study we are optimizing the Nd-YAG welding system parameters (i.e. like laser peak power, pulse energy, welding speed, frequency) to get the best results on Brass and SS-316LN. Stainless Steel is one of the most widely used material at industry level and brass is already widely used in bearings, ammunition casing and for some electrical appliances. In this experiment the welding is being performed using TRUMPH HL- 506P Nd-YAG Laser Welding System and the welding speed is determined using a rotating mechanism to rotate the rod. The welds were inspected using metallography experiment and metallograph results were used to determine the Aspect Ratio. Based on those results the experiment was successfully concluded. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Automatic trigger-word detection in speech is a well known technology nowadays. However, for people who are incapable of speech or are in some silence zone, such voice activated trigger detection systems find no use. We have developed a trigger detection system using the 24 static hand gestures of the American Sign Language (ASL). Our model is primarily based on Deep Convolutional Neural Network (Deep CNN) as they are capable of capturing interesting visual features at each hidden layer. We aim at constructing a customisable switch that can turn ‘on’ if it finds a given trigger gesture in any video that it receives and stays ‘off’ if it does not. The model was trained on images of various hand gestures in a multi-class classification setting. This allows the user to choose a custom trigger gesture for oneself. To test the efficiency of such a model in the trigger detection process, we have made 7,000 videos (each 10s long) consisting of random images from the test set which were never shown to the model during the training process. It is experimentally shown that such a system has a better performance than the other state-of-the art techniques used in static hand gesture image recognition tasks. This approach also finds real-time application and can be applied to develop small scale devices which trigger any particular response by capturing the gestures made by the people. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={In this paper, a novel approach is developed for machine tool maintenance modelling considering fleet system architecture. The fleet system architecture consisting of different types of machine tools from various OEMs operated at different users, but supported by a single repair depot is considered. The prime objective of this paper is to jointly optimize the decisions of Level of Repair (LOR) i.e. repair/move/discard, and Preventive Maintenance (PM) schedules considering user's cost structure and shop floor policy parameters. It is observed that integrated PM and LOR approach gives better Life Cycle Cost (LCC) performance compared to isolated approaches. Also, the importance of user's cost structure and shop floor operations policy parameters in LOR and PM planning is evident from the results. The proposed approach is very useful for the machine tool manufacturers (i.e. OEM) who want to engage into long term maintenance contract with their customers. Integrating LOR and PM is a complex problem. The complexity further increases due to consideration of time dependent failure rate of the machine components, imperfect maintenance which brings partial restoration to the components/systems, and stochastic natures of model parameters. Consequently, a simulation based genetic algorithm approach is used to solve the problem. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In the current work, the effect of engine parameters on the performance of a diesel engine fuelled with diesel-biodiesel blend has been assessed. Homogeneous Reactor model (HRM) was utilized to compute the combustion parameters for a single cylinder diesel engine with unit aspect ratio and capacity of one-litre. The rate of pressure rise has a significant influence on the peak pressure generated, power produced and the degree of smooth transmittance of forces to the piston during the power stroke. The rate of pressure rise can be defined in terms of the crank angle increments since crank angle displacement is an indication of the engine speed. The pressure rise with respect to the crank angle increments were calculated based on three factors namely compression ratio, injection time and boost pressure that were selected for analysis of the diesel engine combustion at three significant levels. A L9 array was used to analyse the response of pressure-crank angle gradient "dp/dθ" as the output variable. From the Taguchi analysis of the effect of the three parameters, injection timing was the most dominant factor for the rise in the pressure gradient followed by boost pressure ratio and compression ratio as the lowest dominant factors. A contour of dp/dθ showed injection timing of 12° BTDC as the most optimum timing for maximum rise in pressure. © 2018 Penerbit Akademia Baru.},

abstract={Due to age-bound onset of symptoms used for diagnosis of mild to moderate intellectual disability, early diagnosis of these problems has long been a difficult issue. The diagnosis includes tests pertaining to intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviours including communication skills etc. In this paper, it is proposed to use speech features as an early indicator of the disorder which can be used to train machine learning algorithms for differentiating between speech of normally developing children and children with intellectual disability. In this paper, speech abnormalities are quantified using acoustic parameters including Linear Predictive Cepstral Coefficients, Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients and spectral features in speech samples of 48 participants (24 with intellectual disability and 24 age-matched controls). A training dataset was created by extracting these features which was used for learning by various classifiers. The experiments show promising results where Support Vector Machine gives an accuracy of 98%. Consequently, a well-trained classification algorithm can be used as an aid in early detection of mild to moderate intellectual disability. © 2018, 3D Research Center, Kwangwoon University and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Peristaltic micro-pumps offer an excellent mechanism for delivery of a variety of medicines including drugs, corneal solutions etc. The surge in deployment of nanoparticles in medicine has provided new potential for such pumps. In light of this we investigate the time-dependent peristaltic flow of nanofluids with diffusive effects through a finite non-uniform channel, this geometry being more representative of real micro-pumps. Creeping flow is taken into account (inertial forces are small compared with viscous forces) i.e., Reynolds number is low (Re <1) and wavelength is also taken to be very large. The Buongiorno formulation for nanofluids is employed with an Oberbeck-Boussinesq approximation. Closed-form solutions are developed for the non-dimensional governing equations subject to physically realistic boundary conditions. Mathematica symbolic software is employed to evaluate the evolution of nanoparticle fraction, temperature, axial velocity, transverse velocity and pressure difference distribution along the length of the pump channel with variation in thermal Grashof number, basic-density (species i.e., mass) Grashof number, Brownian motion parameter and thermophoresis parameter. © 2018, China Ship Scientific Research Center.},

abstract={The combined effects of electric and magnetic fields on peristaltic flow of Jeffery nanoliquids are analytically investigated. Double-diffusive convection in the asymmetric microchannel is also carried out. The walls of the microchannel are propagating with a finite phase difference in a sinusoidal manner. Rosseland diffusion flux model is employed to examine the thermal radiation effect. The zeta potential on the walls is considered very low to apply Hückel–Debye approximations. The coupled non-linear governing equations are simplified by using dimensional analysis and lubrication theory. The closed form solutions for potential function, nanoparticle fraction field, solute concentration field, temperature field, stream function, and axial velocity are derived under the appropriate boundary conditions. It is noteworthy that the pumping characteristics strongly depend on the magnetic fields, electric fields, electric double layer thickness, Jeffery parameter, thermal radiation and Grashof number. Furthermore, trapping phenomenon is analyzed under the effects of Hartmann number, Jeffrey parameter, Grashof number and Helmholtz–Smoluchowski velocity. The novelty of the present work is the amalgamation of biomimetics (peristaltic propulsion), electro-magneto-hydrodynamics and nanofluid dynamics to produce a smart pump system model for smart drug delivery systems. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={Software defined networking (SDN) is an emerging network paradigm which emphasizes the separation of the control plane from the data plane. This decoupling provides several advantages such as flexibility, programmability, and centralized control. However, SDN also introduces new vulnerabilities due to the required communication between data plane and control plane. Examples of threats that leverage such vulnerabilities are the control plane saturation and switch buffer overflow attacks. These attacks can be launched by flooding the TCP SYN packets from data plane (i.e., switches) to the control plane. This paper presents SAFETY, a novel solution for the early detection and mitigation of TCP SYN flooding. SAFETY harnesses the programming and wide visibility approach of SDN with entropy method to determine the randomness of the flow data. The entropy information includes destination IP and few attributes of TCP flags. To show the feasibility and effectiveness of SAFETY, we implement it as an extension module in Floodlight controller and evaluate it under different conditional scenarios. We run a thorough evaluation of our implementation through extensive emulation via Mininet. The experimental results show that when compared to the state-of-the-art, SAFETY brings a significant improvement (13%) regarding processing delay experienced by a legitimate node. Other parameters such as CPU utilization at the controller and attack detection time are also examined and shows improvement in various scenarios. © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Dielectrophoresis (DEP) devices have proven to be one of the most promising tools to transport, accumulate and sort various cells and particles. The major challenge in the development of DEP devices is the high cost, low yield using Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). In this paper, we demonstrate a facile, low-cost, and high-throughput method of constructing continuous-flow DEP devices using screen-printing technology. Much literature has concluded that the use of carbon electrodes provides more cost effective and more durable DEP devices than metal electrodes. More efficient devices not only need to be constructed from a low cost material but also from an inexpensive fabrication technique. In this study, we used yeast cells as model cells to perform a comparative study on trapping efficiency of carbon and gold electrode DEP devices. We have proposed, the sealing of carbon DEP device with glass, instead of PDMS, using adhesive bonding technique which not only reduce the leakage problem but also increases the device performance. We also report the biocompatibility analysis of carbon paste and the results indicates its usefulness in eventual studies involving carbon-MEMS devices. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Genetic factors play a critical role in the development of human diseases. Recently, several molecular genetic studies have provided multiple lines of evidence for a critical role of genetic factors in the expression of human bladder exstrophy-epispadias complex (BEEC). At this point, ISL1 (ISL LIM homeobox 1) has emerged as the major susceptibility gene for classic bladder exstrophy (CBE), in a multifactorial disease model. Here, GWAS (Genome wide association studies) discovery and replication studies, as well as the re-sequencing of ISL1, identified sequence variants (rs9291768, rs6874700, c.137C > G (p.Ala46Gly)) associated with CBE. Here, we aimed to determine the molecular and functional consequences of these sequence variants and estimate the dependence of ISL1 protein on other predicted candidates. We used: (i) computational analysis of conserved sequence motifs to perform an evolutionary conservation analysis, based on a Bayesian algorithm, and (ii) computational 3D structural modeling. Furthermore, we looked into long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) residing within the ISL1 region, aiming to predict their targets. Our analysis suggests that the ISL1 protein specific N-terminal LIM domain (which harbors the variant c.137C>G), limits its transcriptional ability, and might interfere with ISL1-estrogen receptor α interactions. In conclusion, our analysis provides further useful insights about the ISL1 gene, which is involved in the formation of the BEEC, and in the development of the urinary bladder. © 2018 by the authors.

abstract={An asymmetrically heated (only one side of the duct is heated) solar air heater duct is numerically investigated using openFOAM to study the effect of passive turbulators (suspended cylinders) installed within the boundary layer close to the absorber plate to enhance heat transfer from it. Vortex flow is created behind the suspended cylinders, which disturbs the boundary layer and causes mixing of hot stream lines near the surface with relatively cold stream away from the absorber plate. Diameter of the suspended cylinders and its distance from the absorber plate is varied to study its effect on wall temperature of absorber plate in the turbulent flow regime. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.},

abstract={Complex human activity is hard to classify with observational logic. The advent of fabric sensors with discernible and steady response have opened a new avenue for classifying physical activity of humans. Our goal is to construct a smart jacket for human activity/posture classification and to apply machine learning models on the fabric sensor reading to predict physical events. The core concept is in placing stretch sensors, pressure sensors and accelerometer at strategic location to collect the responses. The sensor's response is studied toidentify linearity and repeatability, using which, reliability of data is determined. Further, appropriate Machine learning algorithms can be employed to classify different set of activities. It also important to follow a proper procedure to record data from fabric sensors which create a voltage fluctuation when stretched. We propose a systematic way of design, development, testing and integration of fabric sensors for reliable data collection in this paper. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={The addition of polymer to injection fluid increases the crude oil recovery by improved sweep efficiency. Although it is the most widely used method for chemical enhanced oil recovery (CEOR), limitations such as lower stability of the polymer under reservoir conditions hinder the efficiency of the process. In the current study, a novel nanoparticle assisted polymer flooding approach was carried out to overcome these limitations. To determine whether nanoparticles influence the displacement efficiency of the injected fluid, we used a blend of xanthan gum and nickel nanoparticles. We have evaluated the changes in the dilute solution viscosity of xanthan when the nickel nanoparticles are added and have found out that a xanthan-nickel nanoparticles mixture has a higher intrinsic viscosity of 55.25 dL/g compared to 49.13 dL/g for the gum solution. Efficiency of nanoparticle assisted polymer flooding was evaluated in sand packed bioreactors with ∼0.6 PV of residual oil in place (ROIP). Flooding results demonstrated the highest recovery of 5.98% of additional ROIP with xanthan-nickel nanoparticle mixture compared to 4.48 and 4.58% of ROIP during the separate flooding of xanthan and nanoparticles, respectively. Results suggested the novel nanoparticle assisted polymer flooding approach is able to increase oil recovery beyond available methods. © 2018 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={There has been a developing enthusiasm for programmed human statistic estimation i.e., Age, sexual orientation scare, marks, tattoos and race from unconstrained facial pictures because of an assortment of potential applications in law requirement, security control, and human-PC cooperation. Bounteous writing has explored the issue of computerized age, sexual orientation, and race acknowledgement from unconstrained facial pictures. Nonetheless, in spite of the concurrence of this component, a large portion of the investigations have tended to them independently, next to no consideration has been given to their connections. Programmed statistic estimation remains a testing issue since people having a place with a similar statistic gathering can be tremendously unique in their facial appearances because of natural and extraneous elements. This paper shows a non-exclusive system for the programmed statistic (age. sexual orientation and race) estimation. The proposed approach comprises of the accompanying three principal stages. Preprocessing, Highlight Extraction and Prediction given a face picture. To start with it preprocesses the facial picture next concentrate statistic useful highlights and afterwards, it gauges age, sexual orientation, and race. Tests are directed on two open databases (MORPH II and LFW)[I] MORPH (Craniofacial Longitudinal Morphological Face Database) [1] is one amongst the most important in public accessible longitudinal face databases, The tagged Faces within the Wild (LFW 4) [10] may be an information of faces that contains 13000 pictures of 1680 celebrities tagged with gender, demonstrate that the proposed approach has better execution analyzed than the cutting edge. The proposed method is evaluated based on evaluation measurement precision, recall, accuracy, and MAE. The proposed work gives stable and good results. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Electrokinetic peristaltic multi-layered transport is considered in a micro-channel under the action of an axial electrical field. Three different layers i.e. the core layer, intermediate layer and peripheral layer are simulated with three different viscosities for each fluid layer. The unsteady two-dimensional conservation equations for mass and momentum with electrokinetic body forces, are transformed from the wave frame to the laboratory frame and the electrical field terms are rendered into electrical potential terms via the Poisson–Boltzmann equation, Debye length approximation and ionic Nernst–Planck equation. The dimensionless emerging linearized electrokinetic boundary value problem is solved using integral methods. Closed-form expressions are derived for stream functions in the core, intermediate and peripheral layers. Expressions are also derived for the core–intermediate interface shape and the intermediate–peripheral interface shape. Maximum pressures are also computed. To study bolus migration, the range of the trapping limit is also determined in the peripheral layer. It is found that in the core layer larger boluses are computed in the case of lower intermediate layer viscosity relative to peripheral layer viscosity although the number of boluses is greater when the intermediate layer viscosity exceeds the peripheral layer viscosity. Furthermore, in the intermediate layer, stronger concentration of streamlines is computed in the lower half space with positive Helmholtz–Smoluchowski velocity. Also negative Helmholtz–Smoluchowski velocity reduces the core layer (H1) interface shape whereas it enhances the peripheral layer (H) and intermediate layer (H2) shapes. At lower values of volume flow rate ratio, hydromechanical efficiency is maximum for positive Helmholtz–Smoluchowski velocity whether intermediate layer viscosity is less or greater than peripheral layer viscosity. Finally, greater with greater peristaltic wave amplitude and also for positive Helmholtz–Smoluchowski velocity there is an increase in time-averaged flow rate, whether intermediate layer viscosity is less or greater than peripheral layer viscosity. The analysis is relevant to electro-kinetic hemodynamics and bio-micro-fluidics. © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS},

abstract={Automated segmentation and dermoscopic hair detection are one of the significant challenges in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) of melanocytic lesions. Additionally, due to the presence of artifacts and variation in skin texture and smooth lesion boundaries, the accuracy of such methods gets hampered. The objective of this research is to develop an automated hair detection and lesion segmentation algorithm using lesion-specific properties to improve the accuracy. The aforementioned objective is achieved in two ways. Firstly, a novel hair detection algorithm is designed by considering the properties of dermoscopic hair. Second, a novel chroma-based geometric deformable model is used to effectively differentiate the lesion from the surrounding skin. The speed function incorporates the chrominance properties of the lesion to stop evolution at the lesion boundary. Automatic initialization of the initial contour and chrominance-based speed function aids in providing robust and flexible segmentation. The proposed approach is tested on 200 images from PH2 and 900 images from ISBI 2016 datasets. Average accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and overlap scores of 93.4, 87.6, 95.3, and 11.52% respectively are obtained for the PH2 dataset. Similarly, the proposed method resulted in average accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and overlap scores of 94.6, 82.4, 97.2, and 7.20% respectively for the ISBI 2016 dataset. Statistical and quantitative analyses prove the reliability of the algorithm for incorporation in CAD systems.

abstract={Synthesis of mono-crystalline Ga2O3 Nanorods was done by sol-gel transformation of gallium(III) isopropoxide (Ga(OPri)3). XRD studies were done to determine the planes and crystal structure of synthesized nanorods that showed the synthesis of β-Ga2O3 (a). TEM studies of synthesized Ga2O3 confirmed the synthesis of monocrystalline β-Ga2O3 nanorods. To study the effect of precursor chemistry and to determine role of precursor structures on the crystal structure, phase and morphology of the Ga2O3, a new modified precursor complex was synthesized. The reaction of Ga(OPri)3 with N-phenylsalicylaldimine, [C6H4(OH)CH=N(C6H5)] in 1:1 M ratio yielded [{(H5C6)N = CH-C6H4O}Ga(OPri)2]. The newly synthesized complex was characterized by elemental analyses, molecular weight measurement, FT-IR and NMR (1H and 13C) spectral studies. Spectral studies of the modified complex suggest the presence of bi-dentate mode of attachment of Schiff's base in the solution state. Sol-gel transformations of [{(H5C6)N = CH-C6H4O}Ga(OPri)2] in organic medium, yielded γ-Ga2O3(b), as found by XRD studies. TEM image of the sample (a) revealed the formation of nano-rods of oxide with average diameter of ~100 nm whereas the TEM image of sample (b) showed presence of nano-sized particles of oxide with average particle size of 10 nm. Morphological and compositional studies of synthesized samples (a) and (b) were carried out using SEM and EDX. The method provides a possibility of large scale synthesis of dissimilar shaped and pure Ga2O3 nanoparticles. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.},

abstract={This work explains the behavior of differential drive mobile robot in tracing the source of a chemical emission. Results are simulation based carried out for an indoor environment with source emitting chemical at varying release rates. Robot is able to navigate by sensing the plume concentration in omnidirectional regions without air flow information. The study is based on robot behavior in pursuit of a chemical source while the environment sampling rate and robot surge distances are intertwined. Changes in surge distances are facilitated by predefining number of steps and different wheel speeds which varies from 0.5v to 2.5v where v is 0.3605 m/s in real scenario. Robot with a predefined wheel speed takes minimum one step and maximum up to six steps after which the environmental conditions change. For a single step and a predefined wheel speed, 100 simulations were performed. There are five different wheel speeds to be tested for a step size hence 500 simulations are recorded. So with different combinations of step size varying from one to six with five different wheel speeds produces 3000 simulations. Results are compiled on the basis of elapsed time, distance covered as well as the success rate of robot if it takes the predefined steps and wheel speed for completion of said task. © 2018 IEEE.},

However, experimental in vitro methods showed the transport of natural amino acids and antibiotics, among them ceftazidime. We used molecular dynamics simulations to reveal the importance of the physicochemical properties of ceftazidime in modulating the translocation through OccK8, proposing a structure-function relationship. As in general porins, the internal electric field favors the translocation of polar molecules by gainful energy compensation in the central constriction region. Importantly, the comparatively narrow OccK8 pore can undergo a substrate-induced expansion to accommodate relatively large-sized substrates. © 2018 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={The research works in Handwritten Devanagari Characters are continually evolving into new challenges, which exposed the new sources of further research work like, character normalization, gray-level normalization, a discrimination of the similar characters and many more. This paper discusses the discrimination of the similar characters, which is one of the major sources of classification error. The similar shape character has a very minute difference, which is called critical region and used to discriminate them by human beings. The primary goal of the current work is to identify the critical region of the similar character and use the same to generate additional features in order to minimize the classification errors in the end results. It is also quite challenging to identify the critical region as the characters are written in different handwriting styles and fonts. The paper suggestes the Fisher linear discriminant model to detect the critical region, which is used to extract the additional feature. The experiments work was conducted on the standard database, which has 36172 handwritten Devanagari characters and significant improvement has been recorded by the aforesaid technique. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={Abstract: Here we report, for the first time, development of nanocellulose based novel bio-nanocomposite injectable hydrogel scaffold. An integrated approach has been used to incorporate ultrafine fluorcanasite (FC) glass-ceramic particulates within nanocellulose matrix, synthesized from lignocellulosic biomass. Epichlorohydrin (ECH) was used as a chemical cross-linking agent for hydrogel synthesis. The compositions and properties of bio-nanocomposite hydrogels were controlled by varying the loading of FC and ECH. Moreover, microstructural characterizations and functional group analysis of synthesized nanocellulose and bio-nanocomposite hydrogels were carried out using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). SEM studies revealed successful extraction of cellulosic nanofibres and interconnected porous micro-architecture of injectable hydrogels. Incorporation of FC particulates resulted into development of well-defined micro-porous morphology. FT-IR studies indicated the presence of hydroxyl groups and possible interactions between nanocellulose and FC reinforcements. The rheological study of the developed injectable hydrogel was carried out at different frequency, amplitude and temperature sweeps. The studies revealed that after the incorporation of FC, dynamic storage modulus increased, while synergistically enhancing the injectability of the bio-nanocomposite hydrogels. An optimum loading level of FC reinforcement could also be established. Swelling behaviour studies of the hydrogels demonstrated higher degree of swelling and enhanced structural integrity with incorporation of FC. The novel bio-nanocomposite injectable hydrogels developed in this study, could demonstrate promising potential as injectable implant material.

abstract={Bitcoin is a popular cryptocurrency that records all transactions in a distributed append-only public ledger called blockchain. The security of Bitcoin heavily relies on the incentive-compatible proof-of-work (PoW) based distributed consensus protocol, which is run by the network nodes called miners. In exchange for the incentive, the miners are expected to maintain the blockchain honestly. Since its launch in 2009, Bitcoin economy has grown at an enormous rate, and it is now worth about 150 billions of dollars. This exponential growth in the market value of bitcoins motivate adversaries to exploit weaknesses for profit, and researchers to discover new vulnerabilities in the system, propose countermeasures, and predict upcoming trends. In this paper, we present a systematic survey that covers the security and privacy aspects of Bitcoin. We start by giving an overview of the Bitcoin system and its major components along with their functionality and interactions within the system. We review the existing vulnerabilities in Bitcoin and its major underlying technologies such as blockchain and PoW-based consensus protocol. These vulnerabilities lead to the execution of various security threats to the standard functionality of Bitcoin. We then investigate the feasibility and robustness of the state-of-the-art security solutions. Additionally, we discuss the current anonymity considerations in Bitcoin and the privacy-related threats to Bitcoin users along with the analysis of the existing privacy-preserving solutions. Finally, we summarize the critical open challenges, and we suggest directions for future research towards provisioning stringent security and privacy solutions for Bitcoin. © 1998-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={This article addresses the electrokinetically modulated biomechanical transport through a two-dimensional asymmetric microchannel induced by peristaltic waves. Electrokinetic transport with peristaltic phenomena grabbed a significant attention due to its novel applications in engineering. Electrical fields also provide an excellent mode for regulating flows. The electrohydrodynamics problem is modified by means of Debye–Hückel linearization. Firstly, the governing flow problem is described by continuity and momentum equations in the presence of electrokinetic forces in Cartesian coordinates, then long wavelength and low/zero Reynolds (“neglecting the inertial forces”) approximations are applied to modify the governing flow problem. The resulting differential equations are solved analytically in order to obtain exact solutions for velocity profile whereas the numerical integration is carried out to analyze the pumping characteristics. The physical behaviour of sundry parameters is discussed for velocity profile, pressure rise and volume flow rate. In particular, the behaviour of electro-osmotic parameter, phase difference, and Helmholtz–Smoluchowski velocity is examined and discussed. The trapping mechanism is also visualized by drawing streamlines against the governing parameters. The present study offers various interesting results that warrant further study on electrokinetic transport with peristalsis. © 2018, Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science.},

abstract={Energy efficiency is an important issue in wireless sensor networks; clustering of nodes and sensor data aggregation are popular techniques to address the issue. Sensors generate sensitive data in many applications and thus methods to secure the data so as to prevent easy access by unauthorized agents are essential. Security against false data injection or data tampering can be provided through encryption of sensor data; but it increases load on processing. Securing data, however, puts a burden on the node battery. Data aggregation aims both at data reduction so as to spend less time for encryption as well as reduce transmission load, but demanding additional processing at aggregating node. Thus, aggregation and security are contradictory solutions. The dilemma can be resolved by allowing targeted malleability of encrypted data through homomorphic encryption. The recent research works recommend schemes which use homomorphic MACs, signatures and a blend of private and public cryptography to achieve the purpose. This paper proposes a generalized framework which will be more secure in aspects of secure data aggregation and security of data which include the data privacy and detection of tampering data through homomorphic primitive. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Electrokinetic transport of fluids through microchannels by micro-pumping and micro- peristaltic pumping has stimulated considerable interest in biomedical engineering and other areas of medical technology. Deeper elucidation of the fluid dynamics of such transport requires the continuous need for more elegant mathematical models and numerical simulations, in parallel with laboratory investigations. In this article we therefore investigate analytically the unsteady viscous flow driven by the combined effects of peristalsis and electro-osmosis through microchannel. An integral number of waves propagating in the microchannel are considered as a model for transportation of fluid bolus along the channel length. Debye-Hückel linearization is employed to evaluate the potential function. Low Reynolds number and large wavelength approximations are employed. Closed-form solutions are derived for the non-dimensional boundary value problem. The computations demonstrate that magnitude of electric potential function is increased with a decrease in the thickness of the electrical double layer (EDL). Stronger electric field also decelerates the flow and decreases local wall shear stress. Hydrodynamic pressure is increased with EDL thickness whereas it is suppressed with electric field. Streamline visualization reveals that the quantity of trapped bolus is decreased with increase in EDL thickness and also with higher external electric field. © 2017 Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University},

abstract={Terahertz (THz) radiations focused at multiple positions are quite useful for their medical application. For this, we propose to employ beating of dark hollow Gaussian laser beams (DHGBs) of different beam orders in plasma. In view of realistic situations, we also include the collisions between the electrons and the neutrals. Because of a special intensity gradient distribution in DHGBs, the emitted THz radiation is found to have a unique field profile with multiple focii. The dependence of plasma density, order of the beams and collision frequency on the THz field amplitude is discussed. The important feature to consider hollow Gaussian laser beams is having the same power at different beam orders. It is found that the amplitude of the emitted radiation is highly sensitive to the beam order of the incident lasers. An optimization of the plasma parameters and the lasers characteristics can lead to the enhancement in the THz intensity and the efficiency of the mechanism. © CopyrightEPLA, 2018.},

The synthesized nanoparticles were characterized using UV–Vis, FTIR, FESEM, EDX, AFM, TEM and XRD techniques. UV–visible spectra indicated the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) at 336 nm. The size distribution profiles were analyzed through XRD which revealed the crystalline nature of nanoparticles with average size of 45 nm. TEM and SEM micrographs showed that the particles are spherical and uneven. FTIR spectra reflected the evidence of the presence of anthraquinones, possible bio-molecules responsible for stabilization, reduction and capping of TiO2 NPs. The cytotoxic potential of TiO2 NPs was tested against liver cancer cells (HepG2) lines which was found very effective and the formulation can be used in nano-drug to treat cancer cells in future. © 2018, Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei.},

abstract={A mathematical model to analyze the effects of electric double layer and applied external electric field on peristaltic transport of non-Newtonian aqueous solution through a microchannel is presented. Ostwald–de Waele power law model is employed to describe the non-Newtonian fluid, in an effort to capture the essential biofluid dynamics. The governing equations of physical problem are simplified using low Reynolds number and long wavelength approximations. Poisson Boltzmann equations are also solved under Debye Hückel linearization. Following non-dimensional transformation of the linearized boundary value problem, closed-form analytical solutions are presented for the velocity components, pressure gradient, average flow rate, and stream function subject to physically appropriate boundary conditions. Validation with existing results is also made. A comparative discussion between shear thinning fluid and shear thickening fluids under the influences of Debye length and Helmholtz–Smoluchowski velocity are presented numerically. Trapping phenomenon for dilatant fluids and pseudoplastic fluids under the electrokinetic phenomenon is also computed. This model can help toward designing artificial biomedical devices based on microfluidic devices which can also be applicable to control the physiological transport. © 2018, The Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering.},

abstract={To sustain the adequate bandwidth demands over rapidly growing multimedia traffic and considering the effectiveness of Information-Centric Networking (ICN), recently, HTTP based Dynamic Adaptive Streaming (DASH) has been introduced over ICN, which significantly increases the network bandwidth utilisation. However, we identified that the inherent features of ICN also causes new vulnerabilities in the network. In this paper, we first propose a novel attack called as Bitrate Oscillation Attack (BOA), which exploits fundamental ICN characteristics: in-network caching and interest aggregation, to disrupt DASH functionality. In particular, the proposed attack forces the bitrate and resolution of video received by the attacked client to oscillate with high frequency and high amplitude during the streaming process. To detect and mitigate BOA, we design and implement a reactive countermeasure called Fair-RTT-DAS. Our solution ensures efficient bandwidth utilisation and improves the user perceived Quality of Experience (QoE) in the presence of varying content source locations. For this purpose, Fair-RTT-DAS consider DASH's two significant features: round-trip-time (RTT) and throughput fairness. In the presence of BOA in a network, our simulation results show an increase in the annoyance factor in user's spatial dimension, i.e., increase in oscillation frequency and amplitude. The results also show that our countermeasure significantly alleviates these adverse effects and makes dynamic adaptive streaming friendly to ICN's implicit features. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Biodiesel is playing an important role in transport sector as a substitute for petroleum fuels. The present study diagnoses the use of phenolic biofuel blends namely, cardanol at higher fuel injection pressure on the performance and exhaust emissions of a direct injection, 4-stroke, single cylinder compression ignition engine. In this study, biofuel blends used with three different percentage composition of cardanol such as B10M10, B20M10 and B30M10. The results are compared with base line diesel operation at 180 bar standard injection pressure. The experimental results show better engine performance and exhaust emission characteristics for the biofuel blends at 220 bar injection pressure. Biofuel blend B20M10 gives better performance and emission results when compared to B30M10, and there is not much difference in the results when compared to B10M10. B20M10 blend gives slightly lower brake thermal efficiency (BTE), sharp reduction in carbon monoxide (CO), unburnt hydrocarbon (HC) and smoke emissions and drastic increase in oxides of nitrogen emissions (NOx), when compared to baseline diesel operation. ©, Copyright Association of Energy Engineers (AEE).},

abstract={Early rapid detection of Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) bacilli in milk samples is the major challenge since traditional culture method is time consuming and laboratory dependent. We report a simple, sensitive and specific nano-technology based ‘Nano-immuno test’ capable of detecting viable MAP bacilli in the milk samples within 10 h. Viable MAP bacilli were captured by MAP specific antibody-conjugated magnetic nano-particles using resazurin dye as chromogen. Test was optimized using true culture positive (10-bovine and 12-goats) and true culture negative (16-bovine and 25-goats) raw milk samples. Domestic livestock species in India are endemically infected with MAP. After successful optimization, sensitivity and specificity of the ‘nano-immuno test’ in goats with respect to milk culture was 91.7% and 96.0%, respectively. Whereas, it was 90.0% (sensitivity) and 92.6% (specificity) with respect to IS900 PCR. In bovine milk samples, sensitivity and specificity of ‘nano-immuno test’ with respect to milk culture was 90.0% and 93.7%, respectively. However, with respect to IS900 PCR, the sensitivity and specificity was 88.9% and 94.1%, respectively. Test was validated with field raw milk samples (goats-258 and bovine-138) collected from domestic livestock species to detect live/viable MAP bacilli. Of 138 bovine raw milk samples screened by six diagnostic tests, 81 (58.7%) milk samples were positive for MAP infection in one or more than one diagnostic tests. Of 81 (58.7%) positive bovine raw milk samples, only 24 (17.4%) samples were detected positive for the presence of viable MAP bacilli. Of 258 goats raw milk samples screened by six diagnostic tests, 141 (54.6%) were positive for MAP infection in one or more than one test. Of 141 (54.6%) positive raw milk samples from goats, only 48 (34.0%) were detected positive for live MAP bacilli. Simplicity and efficiency of this novel ‘nano-immuno test’ makes it suitable for wide-scale screening of milk samples in the field. Standardization, validation and re-usability of functionalized nano-particles and the test was successfully achieved in field samples. Test was highly specific, simple to perform and easy to read by naked eyes and does not require laboratory support in the performance of test. Test has potential to be used as screening test to estimate bio-load of MAP in milk samples at National level. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Palladium complexes of phosphine free pincer based ligands are currently growing credence as efficient catalysts for C–C cross-coupling reaction under environmentally benign and mild reaction conditions. A series of new palladium complexes 2 a–2 c supported by 2,6-bis(pyrrolyl)pyridine based [NNN]-pincer ligands have been synthesized, and their catalytic activities for Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction were examined. The palladium complexes (2 a–2 c) were synthesized by the reaction of 2,6-bis(pyrrolyl)pyridine ligands (LH2) with Pd(OAc)2 in acetonitrile as a solvent. Electrochemical studies of complexes 2 a–2 c showed two prominent oxidation peaks, which were ascribed to the dianionic pyrrolide ligand and an oxidation peak that can be ascribed to palladium metal center. There is an exhibition of well-coordinated metal directed oxidation of the complexes which indicates a well-established electronic network. Computational studies on complexes 2 a–2 c further supported the experimental observations. These palladium complexes 2 a–2 c can efficiently catalyze Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction of aryl bromides in an aqueous medium. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim},

abstract={In a magnetized inhomogeneous plasmas, usual version of the KdV equation is found to modify by presence of charged dust grains. The density gradient in the plasma shows its dependence on the recombination rate, ion to electron temperature ratio, obliqueness of the magnetic field and the drift velocity of the ions. In the said plasma, only the compressive solitary structures are found to propagate corresponding to two different types of modes. A significant effect of magnetic field and charged dust grains is found on these structures, though these structures show weak dependence on the ionization rate of neutral atoms. Interestingly the solitons with prominent tailing structures are evolved in the plasma under the effect of stronger density gradient and higher recombination. © 2018 Author(s).},

abstract={When hydrogen burns in air, it produces nothing but water vapour. It is therefore the cleanest possible, totally non-polluting fuel. This fact has led some people to propose an energy economy based entirely on hydrogen, in which hydrogen would replace gasoline, oil, natural gas, coal, and nuclear power. Hydrogen is a clean energy source. Therefore, in recent years, demand on hydrogen production has increased considerably. Electrolysis of water, steam reforming of hydrocarbons and auto-thermal processes are well-known methods for hydrogen gas production, but not cost-effective due to high energy requirements. As compare to chemical methods, biological production of hydrogen gas has significant advantages such as bio-photolysis of water by algae, dark and photo-fermentation of organic materials, usually carbohydrates by bacteria. New approach for bio-hydrogen production is dark and photo-fermentation process but with some major problems like dark and photo-fermentative hydrogen production is the raw material cost. By using suitable bio-process technologies hydrogen can be produced through carbohydrate rich, nitrogen deficient solid wastes such as cellulose and starch containing agricultural and food industry wastes and some food industry wastewaters such as cheese whey, olive mill and baker's yeast industry wastewaters. Utilization of aforementioned wastes for hydrogen production provides inexpensive energy generation with simultaneous waste treatment. This review article summarizes bio-hydrogen production from some waste materials with recent developments and relative advantages. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.},

Consequently, collaboration achievement is targeted here by the virtual inspection of digital mock-ups, semi-/ and finished products to enable the circulation of knowledge and exhibiting design iterations in set based models. Nevertheless, challenges are associated to the virtual inspection, which are derived from technological constraints or based on the nature of distant collaboration. An assessment of these challenges is made by means of a hierarchical aggregation to discuss conceptually the applicability of the extension, highlighting future research areas for this field as well. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Over recent years, cognitive radio technology has been paid enormous attention as this innovatory communication archetype can utilize existing wireless spectrum resources more competently. Spectrum sensing is considered to be primary and most essential task for cognitive radio network operators. It has been acknowledged that cooperative spectrum sensing improves the overall sensing performance of the network. But selfish users be likely to act greedily to access the channel without involving in spectrum sensing. In this paper, we considered multiuser de-centralized cooperative spectrum sensing scenario and game theory is used to analyze the cognitive interaction process. A comprehensive expression is derived for throughput and it is, then, maximized through strategic interaction between cognitive users. Simulation result shows that taking part in sensing is not always good in terms of throughput. This work also evaluates network conditions to determine when to contribute in sensing to maximize throughput. © 2018 Elsevier GmbH},

abstract={Oilfields located in western India produce crude by injection of large amounts of water during secondary oil recovery. This water is obtained from underground aquifer and contains 5 mM sulfate approximately. Sulfate present in this water is converted in to sulfide by sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) present in the reservoir. Increased concentration of sulfide in the production fluid negatively impacts oil production and is known as reservoir souring. Most probable number and quantitative PCR enumerated 103-108 SRB ml−1 in various field installations. Isolates from produced water in sulfate containing medium showed similarity with Desulfotomaculum, Desulfomicrobium and Thermodesulfobacterium genera. Similarly, isolates from produced water in nitrate containing medium were related to Tepidiphilus, Paenibacillaceae, Kocuria and Thauera genera. In the present study four sand packed bioreactors simulating moderately high temperature oil reservoir were used for different souring control treatments. Results revealed that continuous injection of 4 mM nitrate or 1.5 mM benzalkonium chloride (BAC) was not able to control souring. However, co-injection of 2 mM nitrate and 0.75 mM BAC completely ceased sulfide production and controlled souring. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Nanofluid dynamics with magnetohydrodynamics has tremendously contributed in industrial applications recently since presence of nanoparticle in base fluids enhances the specific chemical and physical properties. Owing to the relevance of nanofluid dynamics, we analyze the nanofluid flow in the presence of gyrotactic microorganism and magnetohydrodynamics through a stretching/shrinking plate. The impacts of chemical reaction and thermal radiation on flow characteristics are also studied. To simplify the governing equations of microorganisms, velocity, concentration and temperature, the similarity transformations are employed. The couple governing equations are numerically solved using Successive Taylor Series Linearization Method (STSLM). The velocity profile, motile microorganism density profile, concentration profile, temperature profile as well as Nusselt number, skin friction coefficient, Sherwood number and density number of motile microorganisms are discussed using tables and graphs against all the sundry parameters. A numerical comparison is also given for Nusselt number, Sherwood number, skin friction, and density number of motile microorganisms with previously published results to validate the present model. The results show that Nusselt number, Sherwood number and density number diminish with increasing the magnetic field effects. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={A range of bio-nanocomposites were prepared by incorporation of organo modified montmorillonite nanoclay (OMMT) with or without use of aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)3) within polylactic acid (PLA) solution. Furthermore, the solution was employed for modification of ligno-cellulosic (jute) fabric structural reinforcements. The successful incorporation of nanofillers within the host polymer, polylactic acid (PLA) was confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Water uptake and swelling behaviour studies revealed that the water uptake and swelling ratio of bio-composites reduced significantly as compared to pristine jute fabric, whereas upon incorporation of OMMT and Al(OH)3, the water barrier properties reduced even further in the developed bio-nanocomposites. The flexural strength of the bio-nanocomposites also showed improved mechanical and dimensional stability. Synergistic effects of OMMT and Al(OH)3 were observed in enhancing the aforementioned physico-mechanical properties. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies revealed microstructural details of developed samples. Similarly, the thermo-gravimetric analysis and linear burning rate studies of Al(OH)3treated bio-nanocomposite materials revealed enhanced thermal resistance and reduced flammability respectively compared to both pristine woven jute fabric and fabrics treated with PLA alone or those without Al(OH)3. From the above results it can safely be said that the bio-nanocomposite material can be a prospective candidate for development of flame retardant biopackaging. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The present study analyzes the heat energy transfer in nano u- ids ow through the porous stretching surface. Cattanneo-Christov heat ux model is employed to study the heat energy transfer. Darcy law is used to dis- cuss the ow characteristics over the different types of permeable sheets with suction and injection. Nano uids is considered as water based single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) nano uids. A comparative study for SWCNT and MWCNT is also made. Governing equations are transformed into set of ordinary differential equations using similarity transformations. The computational results are obtained by using Runge-Kutta fourth order method along with shooting technique. Nu- merical and graphical results are presented to discuss the effects of various physical parameters on velocity profile, temperature profile, Nusselt number, Sherwood number and skin friction coeficient for different type of nanoparti- cles for suction and injection cases. Stream lines and isotherms are also plotted for three different cases viz. permeable sheet with suction, impermeable sheet and permeable sheet with injection. A comparative analysis with existing re- sults is tabulated which validate that the numerical results of present study have good correlation with existing results. The outcomes of the results show that skin friction coeficient is more for SWCNT in caparison of MWCNT and the boundary layer thickness is maximum for permeable stretching sheet with suction parameter.},

abstract={A mathematical model is presented to analyze the unsteady peristaltic flow of magnetized viscoelastic fluids through a deformable curved channel. The study simulates the bio-inspired pumping of electroconductive rheological polymers which possess both electroconductive and viscoelastic properties. The Jeffrey viscoelastic model is utilized which features both relaxation and retardation terms of relevance to real polymers. A magnetic body force is incorporated for the influence of static radial magnetic field. The mass and momentum conservation equations are formulated in an intrinsic coordinate system and transformed with appropriate variables into a nondimensional system between the wave and the laboratory frames, under lubrication (i.e., low Reynolds number and long wavelength) approximations. Kinematic and no-slip boundary conditions are imposed at the channel walls. A magnetic body force is incorporated for the influence of static radial magnetic field in the primary momentum equation. An analytic approach is employed to determine closed-form solutions for stream function, axial pressure gradient, and volumetric flow rate. Spatiotemporal plots for pressure distribution along the channel (passage) length are presented to study the influences of curvature parameter, relaxation-to-retardation time ratio (Jeffrey first viscoelastic parameter) and Hartmann number (magnetic field parameter). The effects of these parameters on radial velocity distributions are also visualized. Cases of trapping and reflux in a curved channel are discussed. Streamline distributions are included to study trapping phenomena and to investigate more closely the impact of curvature, magnetic field, and viscoelastic properties on bolus evolution. The reflux or retrograde motion of the particles is studied by particle advection based on Lagrangian viewpoint. The simulations provide new insight into the mechanisms of pumping of electroconductive non-Newtonian liquids in realistic geometries. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={This paper presents result analysis of K-Mediod algorithm, implemented on Hadoop Cluster by using Map-Reduce concept. Map-Reduce are programming models which authorize the managing of huge datasets in parallel, on a large number of devices. It is especially well suited to constant or moderate changing set of data since the implementation point of a position is usually high. MapReduce is supposed to be framework of 'big data'. The MapReduce model authorizes for systematic and instant organizing of large scale data with a cluster of evaluate nodes. One of the primary affect in Hadoop is how to minimize the completion length (i.e., make span) of a set of MapReduce duty. For various applications like word count, grep, terasort and parallel K-Mediod Clustering Algorithm, it has been observed that as the number of node increases, execution time decreases. In this paper we verified Map Reduce applications and found as the amount of nodes increases the completion time decreases. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Dynamics in nano domain is different from that of macro domain. Forces which are considered weak in macro world like Van der Waals, electrostatic interactions, Brownian are seen playing significant role in the motion of particle at nanoscale. The importance of stiffness in Brownian motion for a nanoparticle had been established and published in literature. It is observed that when a particle has low stiffness it tends to behave differently from its stiffer counterparts. Present work investigates the significance of near zero value of stiffness on variance in motion of nanoparticle with the help of simulations in MATLAB. Brownian motion of the nanoparticle is modeled using langevin equation considering non-rigidity of matter. © 2018 Author(s).},

abstract={One of the vital application of Emergency Ad hoc Networks is to establish communication between those affected by emergency situation and responders providing services. In most such cases, the conventional communication infrastructure such as wired and cellular networks get damaged and therefore cannot provide communication required to exchange emergency information. Therefore, to cope with such disasters in a fast and coordinated way, the optimal provisioning of the emergency information is crucial. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) are the paramount components for such situations. UAVs can act as mobile base stations and facilitate wireless communication to connect to nearest working telephone network access point. A large scale disaster information system can be formed by combining UAV network with existing available network regardless of some of network lines being damaged and destroyed. In this paper, we have designed a prototype of UAV assisted emergency ad hoc network (EANET). We have also evaluated and compared AODV and ZRP routing protocols by varying the number of UAV assisted EANET nodes in different transmission range cases of disaster scenarios. The experimental results illustrate that ZRP is the most appropriate protocol for emergency situations. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={In the past decade, advancement in the field of nanotechnology enables us to create autonomous nano-machine in which nanoswimmer finds an important place. A major challenge to realize nanoswimmer is on-board energy harnessing for locomotion of nanoswimmer in complex surrounding media. In this paper, a design of piezoelectric based energy harnessing systems is proposed and simulated using COMSOL. The design is inspired by amplified stressing on trunk of a tree due to movement of its branched out structure. Amplified stressing is harmful to tree but the concept on contrary is useful in current context and envisages amplified generation of electricity to actuate nanoswimmer. It has been observed through simulation results that amplification of stresses to the tune of 68.95% is achievable by simple primary branching. Corresponding increase in generated electric potential is around 60% which is quite significant and promising towards attempts to realize a nanoswimmer. © 2018 Author(s).},

abstract={Nanocomposite are the most promising advance multi-phase material, having nano particles in its composition within its structure (size being less than 100 nm) and contain at least one phase with constituents in the Nano-meter size range. The properties of nanocomposites are controlled by the type/size of the reinforcement/nature of bonding and type of processing method. Among the various processes of manufacturing prevalent for discontinuous nano hybrid metal matrix composites, particularly stir casting is accepted as a favorable method, which is also commercially viable. Stir casting is advantageous for mass production of composites for being simple and flexible in nature along with cost effectiveness. As it is low-cost comparably and also offers wide selection of materials. Further, it produces better bonding of reinforcements with the matrix, due to the uniform stirring action. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Selective lignin degrading white rot fungi viz. Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Phlebia brevispora, and Phlebia floridensis were selected to evaluate antioxidant potential and auxin (indole acetic acid) production in complex and synthetic medium. Antioxidant potential of these fungi was tested against different free radicals including 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), nitric oxide, ferrous ion, and ferric ion along with total phenolic content. All the fungal strains produce phenolics ranging from 5.2 to 16.7 mg/ml and demonstrated various free radical and metal ion scavenging activity. Growth medium significantly affected all the activities. Almost similar antioxidant activity (~ 72% DPPH scavenging activity) was demonstrated by all the fungi in yeast extract glucose medium; however, the activity was lower in Czapek dox’s medium (from 60 to 45%). Indole acetic acid production was maximum in P. brevispora (31 μg/ml), which was closely followed by P. chrysosporium and P. floridensis. The extracts did not show any mutagenic or cytotoxic effect. Thus, these white rot fungi highlight their significance as a new source for the prompt production of extracellular antioxidants and auxin. © 2018 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature},

abstract={Free Space Optics (FSO) is an emerging field that includes exclusive features of photonics. Optical carriers are used to deliver data in ultraviolet, visible and infrared bands respectively. It establishes a significant link in either terrestrial or ground to water or ground to space. However, as long as its demand is concerned, their performance is bound by some important factors that are needed to be discussed. In this review, focus is to investigate about the major gaps present as obstacles in the way of conceiving an optimized FSO link. This paper deals with the major contributions achieved in FSO as well as the impairments that are needed to be resolve for the establishment of FSO link. Major outcome parameters are discussed as BER performance, optimization of outage capacity, different modulation techniques, enlargement of beam coverage, spatial diversity, mitigation techniques etc. that directly deals with the performance of transmitting, channeling and receiving part of the FSO system respectively. ©2018 Journal of Communications.},

abstract={The pigment network is considered as one of the most histopathologically relevant indicator of melanoma. The objective of this empirical study is to design a novel automatic system for detection of pigment network and provide a differentiation between typical and atypical network patterns. The algorithm design consists a set of sequential stages. Pigment network masks are detected using a bank of 2D Gabor filters, and a set of pigment network features are extracted to determine the role of pigment network in the diagnosis of the lesion. In the second stage, a machine learning process is carried out using the rules generated from the pigment network masks to identify the typical and atypical pigment network patterns. The proposed methodology was tested on the PH2 dataset of 200 images, obtaining an average sensitivity of 96%, specificity of 100% and accuracy of 96.7% for lesion diagnosis, and an average sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 84.6%, 88.7% and 86.7% respectively, for pigment network classification. The proposed system stands out amongst the few state of art literatures reported in the context of dermoscopic image analysis in terms of performance and methodologies adopted, thus proving the reliability of the proposed study. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={A numerical simulation is presented to study the heat and flow characteristics of blood flow altered by electroosmosis through the tapered micro-vessels. Blood is assumed as non-Newtonian (micropolar) nanofluids. The flow regime is considered as asymmetric diverging (tapered) microchannel for more realistic micro-vessels which is produced by choosing the peristaltic wave train on the walls to have different amplitudes and phase. The Rosseland approximation is employed to model the radiation heat transfer and temperatures of the walls are presumed constants. The mathematical formulation of the present problem is simplified under the long-wavelength, low-Reynolds number and Debye-Hückel linearization approximations. The influence of various dominant physical parameters are discussed for axial velocity, microrotation distribution, thermal temperature distribution and nanoparticle volume fraction field. However, our foremost emphasis is to determine the effects of thermal radiation and coupling number on the axial velocity and microrotation distribution beneath electroosmotic environment. This analysis places a significant observation on the thermal radiation and coupling number which plays an influential role in hearten fluid velocity. This study is encouraged by exploring the nanofluid-dynamics in peristaltic transport as symbolized by heat transport in biological flows and also in novel pharmacodynamics pumps and gastro-intestinal motility enhancement. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={In this paper, we present an analytical study of pressure-driven flow of micropolar non-Newtonian physiological fluids through a channel comprising two parallel oscillating walls. The cilia are arranged at equal intervals and protrude normally from both walls of the infinitely long channel. A metachronal wave is generated due to natural beating of cilia and the direction of wave propagation is parallel to the direction of fluid flow. Appropriate expressions are presented for deformation via longitudinal and transverse velocity components induced by the ciliary beating phenomenon with cilia assumed to follow elliptic trajectories. The conservation equations for mass, longitudinal and transverse (linear) momentum and angular momentum are reduced in accordance with the long wavelength and creeping Stokesian flow approximations and then normalized with appropriate transformations. The resulting non-linear moving boundary value problem is solved analytically for constant micro-inertia density, subject to physically realistic boundary conditions. Closed-form expressions are derived for axial velocity, angular velocity, volumetric flow rate and pressure rise. The transport phenomena are shown to be dictated by several non-Newtonian parameters, including micropolar material parameter and Eringen coupling parameter, and also several geometric parameters, viz eccentricity parameter, wave number and cilia length. The influence of these parameters on streamline profiles (with a view to addressing trapping features via bolus formation and evolution), pressure gradient and other characteristics are evaluated graphically. Both axial and angular velocities are observed to be substantially modified with both micropolar rheological parameters and furthermore are significantly altered with increasing volumetric flow rate. Free pumping is also examined. An inverse relationship between pressure rise and flow rate is computed which is similar to that observed in Newtonian fluids. The study is relevant to hemodynamics in narrow capillaries and also bio-inspired micro-fluidic devices. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

The magnetic measurements carried out on as prepared sample show signature square hysteresis loop of Fe, which transforms into non-magnetic one in 500 °C annealed sample due to the formation of FeSi2 interface alloy at the expense of Fe atoms from the layer and Si atoms from the substrate. No intermixing between Fe and Au is seen. Corresponding X-ray reflectivity (XRR) measurements performed on as deposited sample shows clear Kiessig oscillations and can be fitted without considering intermixed layer between Fe and Si, while annealed sample shows interface mixing leading to an increase in thickness and density. The observed results are explained in terms of annealing induced changes at the Fe/Si interface which result in the formation of ß-FeSi2 phase. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

The objective of this project is to analyse the effect of dust on the performance of PV system in Manipal University, Jaipur with the use of LABVIEW based data logger. All the important parameters (open circuit voltage, short circuit current, output power etc.) related to both the panels were noted down and compared with the use of characteristic curve.

abstract={Standard IP is not suitable for internet access in mobile devices because such devices are portable and IP address keeps on getting change in wireless networks. Mobile IP is introduced to provide internet in mobile devices (i.e host mobility). There can be situation, where group of nodes (Mobile Nodes) moves from one network to another network range while accessing internet as network mobility (i.e Network Mobility (NEMO)). In NEMO, there will be gateway called Mobile Router (MR) and provides internet to all MNs and takes care about handoff for all mobile nodes. Whenever NEMO moves from home network to foreign network, it gets new address from visiting network and it has to update Home Agent (HA) regarding its address change. MR intimate about its address changes to HA through Binding Update (BU) and HA sends Binding Acknowledgement (BA) to MR as response. Various security threats arise during messages exchange and during registration between MN, MN, HA and between MN, CN (route optimization path). In this paper, we proposed security method for providing secure Route Optimization (RO) and communication between MN, MR and HA using ECC with stream cipher cryptography. The solution is simulated in NS2 and proved that our solution can protect from all standard attacks using security analysis.

abstract={Network Mobility (NEMO) is invented for providing internet to group of nodes (smart phones, ipad and laptop).It is inherited from Mobile IPv6. There are security threats inside the NEMO during handoff while exchanging Binding Updates (BU) between the Mobile Network Node (MNN), Correspondent Node (CN) and Home Agent (HA). It may prone to several malicious attacks also during the network address exchange between nodes inside the NEMO. A proper end-to-end security mechanism is required to protect the Binding Update and Binding Acknowledgement. We have proposed a security architecture to provide authentication and confidentiality at each and every level of communication (MNN? HA,MR? HA, MNN?

abstract={An analytical study for electroosmotic flow of Bingham plastic ionic liquids driven by peristaltic pumping through a microchannel is investigated. The Poisson-Boltzmann equation for electric potential distribution is implemented to accommodate the electrical double layer in the microchannel. Boundary layer flow model is simplified under the low Reynolds number and long wavelength approximations. The solution of the electrical potential is based on the Debye- Hückel approximation for a symmetric (Z: Z) electrolyte solution. Closed form solutions for axial velocity, pressure gradient, pressure rise along one wavelength and stream function are derived. To examine the influence of physical parameters like Bingham plug flow width, electroosmotic parameter and Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity on pumping characteristics, computational results are illustrated. With vanishing yield stress, the Newtonian case is retrieved. An increase in plug flow width is observed to decrease volumetric flow rate and has a varied influence on the pressure rise depending on whether the flow is in the free pumping or pumping region. The findings of this study may useful in designing the microfluidics peristaltic pumps which often required to minimize the circulating volume of fluid and also helping to integrate the micropumping structure into the microfluidics circuit. © 2018 Author(s).},

abstract={Treatment or prevention of osteoporotic bone loss is a challenge for clinicians. Recent research efforts have shown that dynamic and cyclic loading may effectively prevent or reverse bone resorption as loading enhances osteogenesis. Loading-induced canalicular fluid flow in bone is considered as a potential stimulus of new bone formation. It is believed that poroelastic material properties such as porosity and permeability typically decide fluid flow in canalicular spaces of bone. Accordingly, the authors hypothesized that changes in poroelastic material properties with age may affect the fluid flow, which in turn affects the new bone response against any external mechanical stimulation. This work attempts to relate the age-related changes in poroelastic material properties to fluid-flow distribution in lacuna-canalicular spaces of bone. The outcomes may be useful in the development of effective strategies to enhance the canalicular fluid flow, so that optimal exercises or sports activities can be designed to prevent or reverse the age-related bone loss. © 2018 Author(s).},

abstract={The present study was undertaken to determine the maximum ground level concentrations (GLC's) for various air pollutants through air dispersion modelling technique. This information of maximum GLC's would then be utilized to assess the relative contributions of emissions due to the operation of the cement production unit. The information would also support in the assessment of the viability of the existing ambient air monitoring network in and around the cement plant. The cement company produces Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) and Pozzolona Portland Cement (PPC) at their unit in Rajasthan, India. The plant is ISO-9001, ISO-14001, and OHSAS-18001 certified and maintains very high level standards in Quality, Environment and Safety fields. It was found that in the study area, the maximum predicted average contribution to ambient PM10, PM2.5, SO2 and NOx due to the operation of cement plant, were 13.6%, 8.2%, 10%, and 17% respectively, as compared to the current National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS, 2009) value. The existing ambient air quality monitoring network was also found to be satisfactory with regards to the representativeness of the data being collected. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Present work mainly aims to explore possible utilization of photosensitive chalcopyrite CdAl2Se4 as potential material in optoelectronic applications. In view to ascertain that, we have performed first principle investigations within frame work of density functional theory (DFT) using full potential linearized augmented plane wave method (FP-LAPW). For better accuracy, volume optimization of lattice parameters and computations of relevant properties are executed using one of the most accurate modified Becke-Johnson (mBJ) potential. Electronic properties revealed are energy bands, total and partial density of states (DOS) which proves direct band gap (2.92 eV) nature for the present compound and supports its deployment in opto-electronic applications. In addition, in order to judge optical response, investigations such as dielectric tensor, reflectivity, refraction and absorption spectra are reported here as a function of frequency. Results observed showing high intensity of absorption spectra in visible energy range i.e. 3-5 eV validate the application of CdAl2Se4 in opto-electronic devices. Calculated results are observed to have reasonable agreement with available experimental calculations. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={With several waste additives been used for increasing the flexural strength of concrete, this research aims at using human hair as an economic and environmental friendly waste material adding much to the sustainable development. Flexural strength of concrete is one of its key mechanical property. By virtue of its flexural strength, concrete beams and slabs are able to transfer the loads to the supports. The present concrete matrix gives only 10 to 12 percent of flexural strength as compared to its compressive strength. Human hair lasts for decades before finally decomposing and entering to Carbon and Nitrogen cycle. The waste human hair dumped in the streams chokes the streams and increases the environmental burden. In this experimental work, feasibility for enhancing the flexural strength of concrete with two-dimensional variation in human hair i.e., the length of hair fiber and its proportion in the concrete matrix, has been investigated. The concrete specimens tested at the age of 7 and 28 days, reveled an increase in the flexural strength as compared to the control mix. The results indicated the possibility of using human hairs as fibers in the concrete mix for sustainable construction practices. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={In vivo studies suggest that cyclic and low-magnitude loading can be useful over pharmaceutical drugs in normalizing bone loss as it encourages osteogenesis (i.e. new bone formation) at the sites of elevated strain magnitude. In silico models assumed normal strain or strain energy density (SED) as the stimulus to predict loading-induced osteogenesis, however, these models may have limited success in fitting the in vivo new bone formation at several instances. For example, rest-inserted cyclic loading amplifies the new bone formation as compared to continuous-cyclic loading even though similar strain magnitude were induced in both the cases. It is also believed that loading-induced interstitial fluid flow can also be a potential stimulus of osteogenesis. The present study hypothesizes that fluid motion as osteogenic stimulus may explain the afore-mentioned anomalies. Accordingly, this work studies osteogenesis as functions of SED and canalicular fluid motion using an in silico model. Therefore, the new bone formation is considered roughly proportional to stimuli above their osteogenic thresholds. This model attempts to simulate in vivo new bone formation noticed in rest-inserted cantilever loading studies. The model's prediction of site-specific new bone formation improves when fluid flow is considered as the stimulus. It is also noticed that fluid motion as the stimulus closely fits the new bone formation for another in vivo study where the effects of aging on osteogenesis were examined. These attempts to establish fluid flow as a potential osteogenic stimulus can be useful in the prediction of site-specific new bone formation. The findings will ultimately be useful in designing biomechanical interventions such as prophylactic exercises to cure bone loss. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The rapid increase in population of India forced people to migrate from rural areas and small towns to metropolitan cities for better employment, education, and, good lifestyle. Major cities of India were industrialized and required more work force in metropolitan cities, leading to uncoordinated and unplanned growth, often termed as urban sprawl. Urban sprawl destroyed the natural resources such as open green space, agricultural land, open water bodies and ground water. In this paper, an attempt has been made to monitor urban sprawl using Shannon's Entropy model, Remote Sensing, and GIS for city Jaipur, India. The changed entropy value during the years 1972-2013 proves more dispersed growth in the city. The built-up area of Jaipur has increased from 40 km2 in 1972 to 400 km2 in 2013. Land use percentage of urban settlement is doubled as compared to the urban population of Jaipur during 1972-2013. This study shows remarkable urban sprawl in fringe areas of Jaipur city in the last 41 years. © 2018 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.},

A graph wavelet transform-based steganography using graph signal processing (GSP) is presented, which results in better visual quality stego image as well as extracted secret image. In the proposed scheme, graph wavelet transforms of both the cover image and transformed secret image (using Arnold cat map) are taken followed by alpha blending operation. The GSP-based inverse wavelet transform is performed on the resulting image, to get the stego image. Here, the use of GSP increases the inter-pixel correlation that results in better visual quality stego and extracted secret image as shown in simulation results.

abstract={Misalignments in gears cause vibrations and contact nonlinearities, which in turn cause load distribution shift on the gear tooth. The load distribution shift of the gear pair results in increased contact and bending stresses with the maximum stresses leaning towards the edge of the face width. These stress changes cause failures and gear performance variations, such as pitting, scuffing, crack initiation and eventually tooth breakage. In this paper, the contact and bending stresses of a misaligned spur gear pair were evaluated with and without friction by employing corresponding analytical methods and finite element method (FEM). Friction coefficient values of 0.1 to 0.3 were used to evaluate the effects of friction on contact and bending stress distribution of a spur gear pair with axial and angular misalignments. The stress concentration was found to be higher at the contact point and at the tooth root of the gear with the augmentation of the misalignment distance and angle. The maximum contact and bending stresses increased by 67.5% and 18.9%, respectively, when axial misalignments were subjected. Similarly, the maximum contact and bending stresses increased by 27.0% and 62.4%, respectively, for angular misalignments. Furthermore, the contact and bending stresses increased proportionally with the increasing coefficient of friction. Finally, the relationships between the normalized stress and misalignments (both axial and angular) were established. © Universiti Malaysia Pahang, Malaysia.},

abstract={Cyclic and low-magnitude loading is considered effective in arresting the bone loss as it promotes osteogenesis (i.e. new bone formation) at the sites of elevated normal strain magnitude. In silico models assumed normal strain as the stimulus to predict the sites of new bone formation. These models, however, may fail to fit the amount of newly formed bone. Loading parameters such as strain, frequency, and loading cycle decide the amount of new bone formation. The models did not incorporate this information. In fact, there is no unifying relationship to quantify the amount of new bone formation as a function of loading parameters. Therefore, the present work aims to establish an empirical relationship between loading parameters and a new bone formation parameter i.e. mineral apposition rate (MAR). A neural network model is used to serve the purpose. Loading parameters are supplied as input, whereas, MAR served as output. The model is trained and tested with experimental data. The model establishes an empirical relationship to estimate MAR as a function of loading parameters. The model's predictions of MAR align with in vivo experimental results. The model's response is analyzed which indicates that the bone adaptation characteristics are successfully captured in the relationship. The relationship established may be incorporated further to improve qualitative and quantitative prediction capabilities of computer models. These findings can be extended in future to design and develop effective biomechanical strategies such as prophylactic exercise to cure bone loss. © 2018},

abstract={A theoretical study is presented of peristaltic hydrodynamics of an aqueous electrolytic non-Newtonian Jeffrey bio-rheological fluid through an asymmetric microchannel under an applied axial electric field. An analytical approach is adopted to obtain the closed form solution for velocity, volumetric flow, pressure difference and stream function. The analysis is also restricted under the low Reynolds number assumption (Stokes flow) and lubrication theory approximations (large wavelength). Small ionic Peclét number and Debye–Hückel linearization (i.e. wall zeta potential ≤ 25 mV) are also considered to simplify the Nernst–Planck and Poisson–Boltzmann equations. Streamline plots are also presented for the different electro-osmotic parameter, varying magnitudes of the electric field (both aiding and opposing cases) and for different values of the ratio of relaxation to retardation time parameter. Comparisons are also included between the Newtonian and general non-Newtonian Jeffrey fluid cases. The results presented here may be of fundamental interest towards designing lab-on-a-chip devices for flow mixing, cell manipulation, micro-scale pumps etc. Trapping is shown to be more sensitive to an electric field (aiding, opposing and neutral) rather than the electro-osmotic parameter and viscoelastic relaxation to retardation ratio parameter. The results may also help towards the design of organ-on-a-chip like devices for better drug design. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.},

The band-edges are observed to shift, thereby lowering the band-gaps of the base polymers upon doping. While the changes are seen only below the absorption edge in PVA, PMMA exhibits alterations in both the band edge and overall transmission in the range of 300–900 nm.

abstract={We have employed relativistic mean-field plus BCS (RMF+BCS) approach for the study of even-even superheavy nuclei with Z = 118 which is the last and recent observed element in the periodic chart so far. Our study includes binding energies, Qα values, alpha-decay half-lives and spontaneous decay half-lives along with comparison of available experimental data and the results of FRDM calculations. We find an excellent match with the only known decay chain of 294118 for Z = 118 so far and predict decay chain of 292118 and 296118 in consistency with known experimental decay chains and FRDM results. These results may provide a very helpful insight to conduct experiments for realizing the presence of nuclei with Z = 118. © 2018 Author(s).},

abstract={In the present work thermal performance of Direct Absorption Solar Collector (DASC) with TiO2-water (nanofluid) as working fluid was investigated experimentally. DASC utilizes the principle of volumetric absorption i.e. solar energy absorbed by a thin film of working fluid flowing over the collector plate. The experimental study was carried out in four phases; in first phase flow rate was kept 2 lpm and volume fraction of nanofluid was changed from 0.001% to 0.007%, in second and third phase same procedure was followed for 2.5 lpm and 1.5 lpm flow rates respectively. In fourth phase the experiment was carried out with water for 1.5 lpm, 2 lpm and 2.5 lpm and the performance of collector was analyzed. Results obtained suggest that for water as a working fluid, thermal performance of the DASC at 2 lpm was better. Secondly, when nanofluid was used as a working fluid, thermal performance of the collector was found better for 0.005% volume concentration. © 2018 IEEE.},

In this work, we study the phenomenon of the Bloch-Siegert shift in Weyl semimetal at far from resonance called anomalous Bloch-Siegert shift (ABSS) by purely quantum mechanical treatment and describe it's anisotropic nature. A fully numerical solution of the Floquet-Bloch equations unequivocally establishes the presence of not only anomalous Rabi oscillations in these systems but also their massless character. © 2018 Author(s).},

abstract={Progressive Visual Cryptography (PVC) is quite suitable for sharing sensitive digital data. Previous research on PVC, such as Fang et al. (2006) and W.P.Fang et al.(2008) were all carrying pixel-expansion problem and also gives a poor visual quality on the recovered stacked image. Recently, Hou & Quan (2011) have developed a progressive scheme for secret sharing. It is observed that shares generated by the scheme are free from pixel expansion problem, but shares are not fully secure. In this paper, a new progressive sharing algorithm based on logistic chaotic map has been proposed to overcome the said limitation of Hou (2011) scheme. The irregular outputs of the logistic map are used to encode a secret digital information carrying image. The performance of the algorithm in the scheme of Hou (2011) is critically analyzed and compared with new suggested scheme. Empirical results are presented to showcase the performance of the authors' proposed scheme in terms of its effectiveness (imperceptibility and security) and feasibility. © 2018 by IGI Global.

The pattern gets indexed in wurtzite (hexagonal) structure with lattice constants a=b=3.2525Å and c=5.2071Å and approves the single phase material with no impurity. The values of particle size assessed by Debye Scherer's (DS) formula lie in the range of 13nm to 33nm indicating the nano-crystalline nature of the sample. The morphological analysis of the sample was performed by Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements. The observed size of Zn0.9Mn0.05Fe0.05O nanoparticles by TEM micrograph exhibits the similar trend with the size calculated by Debye-Scherer formula. TEM image show the irregular shape of the nanoparticles and particle size lies in the range of 10-35nm.

abstract={Multi-walled Carbon nanotubes-copper (MWCNT/Cu) composite powders with variable MWCNT content were synthesized by modified electro-co-deposition method. The electro-co-deposited MWCNT/Cu powders were consolidated by conventional compaction and sintering process. The consolidated products were then hot rolled and cold drawn to fine wires. The MWCNT/Cu composite wire samples were characterized for electrical and mechanical properties. We have been able to achieve an increase of around 8% in electrical conductivity of the form wires repeatedly. It has been observed that there was gradual improvement in the properties with reinforcement of MWCNT in the copper matrix. The betterment of electrical property has been achieved with simultaneous improvement in mechanical properties of the wire. The yield strength of MWCNT/Cu composite wire was found to be four times and the tensile strength two times greater than that of pure copper. The improved properties are attributed to the proper distribution of MWCNTs in the copper matrix and excellent interfacial bonding between MWCNT and composite copper fabricated by the modified method. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={In this article, the design and performance of circular radiating patch element with two U-shaped slots and defected ground plane, comprising of a triangular notch monopole structure with rhomboid shape resonator, is reported. The proposed multiband antenna has a compact structure design for GSM 1800 MHz, WLAN, WiMAX and UWB communication systems. The antenna is designed on FR4 glass epoxy substrate of size 39 mm × 34 mm × 1.59 mm by using computer simulation tool CST Microwave Studio 2014. For confirmation of simulation results, prototypes are fabricated and their performance is tested in free space. Measured results demonstrate that fabricated antenna provides triple bands with impedance bandwidth of 157 MHz (1.733 GHz to 1.89 GHz), 3.2 GHz (2.29 GHz to 5.49 GHz) & 10.45 GHz (6.83 GHz to 17.28 GHz), almost flat high gain between 4 to 6 dBi and good radiation patterns in the desired frequency range. The maximum measured gain of proposed structure is close to 6.59 dBi at 4.40 GHz. The circular polarization is also realized in the frequency range 4.12 GHz to 5.20 GHz with axial impedance bandwidth 1.08 GHz. The specific absorption rate SAR values of proposed design are also evaluated at various frequency spots which are well within the SAR values specified by the FCC. Proposed design may be proved a useful structure for advance radio communications systems as well as for the present requirements in defence applications. © School of Engineering, Taylor’s University.},

abstract={An analytical study of microvascular non-Newtonian blood flow is conducted incorporating the electro-osmosis phenomenon. Blood is considered as a Bingham rheological aqueous ionic solution. An externally applied static axial electrical field is imposed on the system. The Poisson-Boltzmann equation for electrical potential distribution is implemented to accommodate the electrical double layer in the microvascular regime. With long wavelength, lubrication and Debye-Hückel approximations, the boundary value problem is rendered non-dimensional. Analytical solutions are derived for the axial velocity, volumetric flow rate, pressure gradient, volumetric flow rate, averaged volumetric flow rate along one time period, pressure rise along one wavelength and stream function. A plug swidth is featured in the solutions. Via symbolic software (Mathematica), graphical plots are generated for the influence of Bingham plug flow width parameter, electrical Debye length and Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity (maximum electro-osmotic velocity) on the key hydrodynamic variables. This study reveals that blood flow rate accelerates with decreasing the plug width (i.e. viscoplastic nature of fluids) and also with increasing the Debye length parameter. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Bio composite materials were fabricated using mixing biodegradable polymer polycaptalactone (PCL) and Organo Modified Montmorillonite Clay (OMMT) through solution casting. Various samples of bio composite films were prepared by varying the OMMT wt% composition by 0.1%, 0.5%, 1% and 1.5%. Thereafter, the density and water absorption of the composites were investigated with respect to immersion time in water. The moisture absorption results show that with an increase in weight percentage (from 0.1 to wt 1.5%) of OMMT within the bio polymer films, the absorption value of bio-nanocomposite films reduced rapidly from 34.4% to 22.3%. The density of hybrid composites also increased with increase in weight percentage of OMMT. The swelling characteristic of PCL increased with increasing % of OMMT clay. These results indicate that the optimized composition of constituents in composite membrane could effectively reduce the anhydrous conditions of bio-composite film. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Two bioreactors (column and U-tube) were compared for continuous dye decolourization efficiency using a laccase-producing white rot fungus, Phlebia radiata. Column bioreactor containing immobilized crude enzyme beads and U-tube continuous bioreactor containing actively growing fungal biomass were established. Synthetic dye (coracryl blue C5G) solution treated with immobilized crude enzyme on alginate beads showed a maximum net decolourization up to 55% (flow rate 1 ml/min). The U-tube bioreactor was more efficient in decolorizing the dye, which showed a net decolourization up to 64% at faster flow rate (2.5 ml/min). The decolorization efficiency in both the systems was positively influenced by the slower flow rate. Thus, the study presents designing and operations of two continuous small-scale bioreactors one with immobilized enzyme while the another one with direct fungal contact. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The energy harnessing is a process of obtaining energy from the surrounding environment and converting into electrical energy. In the last two decades, there has been a plenteous study in energy harnessing. Now a day, energy harnessing using piezoelectric materials has drawn attention of researchers due to low cost, flexibility and light weight. The benefits of piezoelectric material can be utilized by designing a self-powered device for artificial nanoswimmer. Some of the ceramics which displays the piezoelectric effect are lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT), lead-titanate (PbTiO2), lead-zirconate (PbZrO3) and Barium Titanate (BaTiO3). PZT is most extensively used piezoelectric material in the field of energy harnessing but it is brittle in nature. Lead based piezoelectric materials are toxic in nature and may not suitable for in-vivo biomedical applications. To eradicate this problem, researchers are interested in synthesizing lead free piezoelectric material such as Aluminium Nitride (AIN), Barium Titanate (BaTiO3) and Polyvinylidenefluoride (PVDF). The biocompatibility of PVDF makes it appropriate to be used for energy harnessing in human body for applications like on board powering of nanoswimmer for various disease detection and drug delivery. In this paper, a cantilever beam is being simulated in COMSOL to study electric potential generated on the surface of beam made of different piezoelectric materials such as AIN, PVDF and PZT due to fluidic pressure, which will be utilized as energy for actuation of artificial nanoswimmer. Piezo-based cantilever beams have been compared and maximum electric potential is being observed in PVDF based beam. PVDF seems most promising piezoelectric material for in-vivo biomedical application and it is readily available. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Graphene, topological insulators (TI) and the Weyl semimetal are shown to be well-characterized using the phenomenon of anomalous Rabi oscillation (ARO). These oscillations occur far from conventional resonance and Floquet theory shows them to be unique to these systems. Of particular interest is the bulk topological insulator (TI) where the wave-vector dependent frequency of the ARO is seen to be gapped in topologically trivial situations and gapless when there is a non-vanishing Chern number. It is shown that the Chern number may be directly inferred by performing a pump-probe experiment in the bulk without referring to surface states. A simpler alternative to the Lindblad method is invoked in order to incorporate dephasing effects that despite leading to a non-unitary time evolution of the wave-function, is nevertheless, probability conserving. The differential transmission coefficient versus the pump pulse duration (when all else is held fixed) has the form of a sinusoidal function with an amplitude that decays as a power law in the pump duration (alternatively, the “area” of the pump pulse). The exponent of this power law decay is indicative of the Chern number of the bulk in case of TI and more generally indicative of the particular member of the family of materials that may be collectively referred to as – Dirac-Weyl materials. © 2018, EDP Sciences, SIF, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={An analytical analysis is presented in this work to assess the influence of micropolar nature of fluids in fully developed flow induced by electrokinetically driven peristaltic pumping through a parallel plate microchannel. The walls of the channel are assumed as sinusoidal wavy to analyze the peristaltic flow nature. We consider that the wavelength of the wall motion is much larger as compared to the channel width to validate the lubrication theory. To simplify the Poisson Boltzmann equation, we also use the Debye-Hückel linearization. We consider governing equation for micropolar fluid in absence of body force and couple effects however external electric field is employed. The solutions for axial velocity, spin velocity, flow rate, pressure rise, and stream functions subjected to given physical boundary conditions are computed. The effects of pertinent parameters like Debye length and Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity which characterize the EDL phenomenon and external electric field, coupling number and micropolar parameter which characterize the micropolar fluid behavior, on peristaltic pumping are discussed through the illustrations. The results show that peristaltic pumping may alter by applying external electric fields.

The mathematical analysis is carried out in the form of electroosmosis, flow analysis and heat transfer analysis. Velocity slip conditions are imposed to solve momentum equation and thermal energy equation. Time dependent volumetric flow rate is considered which varies exponentially. Closed form solutions for potential function is obtained under Debye-Hückel approximation and velocity and temperature fields are obtained under low Reynolds number and large wavelength approximations. The influence of Hartmann number, electroosmotic parameter, slip parameters, Zeta potential, and couple stress parameter on flow characteristics, pumping characteristics and trapping phenomenon is computed. The effects of thermal slip parameters, Joule heating parameter, and Brinkman number on heat transfer characteristics are also presented graphically.

abstract={This paper aims to analyze the electroosmotic flow of non-Newtonian ionic nanoliquids in presence of peristaltic propulsion. A geometric model is employed for a microfluidic tapered channel flow regime. Williamson's fluid model is utilized to characterize non-Newtonian nature of the base fluid. The normalized governing equations are reduced with lubrication approximations (long wavelength and low Reynolds number assumptions). Poisson-Boltzmann equation is also simplified by using Debye-Hückel linearization. No slip conditions are imposed at the channel walls. The analytical solutions are obtained for temperature field and nanoparticle volume fraction. However, a perturbation method is used to find out an approximate solution for axial velocity, pressure rise and volumetric flow rate. The perturbation solutions are further graphically illustrated with MATLAB software. The perturbation solution is also validated with numerical results simulated by MATLAB coding through BVP command. The effects of thermal radiation and non-Newtonian parameters on flow characteristics, pumping characteristics, wall shear stress and trapping phenomenon are discussed. A comparative study is also made to study the electroosmotic flow through uniform and nonuniform asymmetric microfluidic channel. This model can help to study the intrauterine fluid dynamics governed by electroosmosis mechanism. It can also be applicable in drug delivery, in vivo diagnostics, food diagnostics, packaging (smart sensors), DNA chips, protein chips and cell chips. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The spin transport properties of pristine graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) have been most widely studied using theoretical and experimental tools. The possibilities of oxidation of fabricated graphene based nano electronic devices may change the device characteristics, which motivates to further explore the properties of graphene oxide nanoribbons (GONRs). Therefore, we present a systematic computational study on the spin polarized transport in surface oxidized GNR in antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin configuration using density functional theory combined with non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) method. It is found that the conductance in oxidized GNRs is significantly suppressed in the valance band and the conduction band. A further reduction in the conductance profile is seen in presence of two oxygen atoms on the ribbon plane. This change in the conductance may be attributed to change in the surface topology of the ribbon basal plane due to presence of the oxygen adatoms, where the charge transfer take place between the ribbon basal plane and the oxygen atoms. © 2018 Author(s).},

abstract={The Bloch-Siegert shift is a phenomenon in quantum optics, typically seen in two-level systems, when the driving field is sufficiently strong. The inclusion of frequency doubling effect (counter rotating term) in the conventional rotating wave approximation (RWA) changes the resonance condition thereby producing a rather small shift in the resonance condition, which is known as the Bloch-Siegert shift (BSS). Rabi oscillations in Dirac-Weyl fermionic systems exhibit anomalous behavior far from resonance, called anomalous Rabi oscillations. Therefore, in the present work, we study the phenomenon of the Bloch-Siegert shift in Weyl semimetal and topological insulator (TI) far from resonance, called anomalous Bloch-Siegert shift (ABSS). It is seen that the change in the resonance condition of anomalous Rabi oscillations is drastic in Weyl semimetal and TI. The ABSS in Weyl semimetals is highly anisotropic, whereas it is isotropic in TI. In case of TI, it is the Chern number which plays a crucial role to produce substantial change in the ABSS. © 2018 Author(s).},

abstract={This paper proposes a resilient, bandwidth scalable and energy efficient WDM–TDM passive optical network (PON) architecture that provides network access services to the end user at very high data rates and reduces the power consumption of access network significantly in the presence of low traffic/underutilized network. The proposed power saving technique includes the efficient use of proper line cards (LC) and adaptive link rate (ALR) mechanism at optical line terminal located at the central office. In the presence of low traffic, ALR switches link rate from 10 to 1 Gbps depending on the particular threshold value of traffic load. In the presence of narrowband traffic, a significant amount of energy is saved. Proposed architecture also saves capital expenditure (CAPEX) at remote node and reduces significant CAPEX for larger networks. This architecture also provides network resiliency against LC/TRx or module failure and bandwidth scalability to support future generation PON architectures without any service interruption. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={The transportation of biological and industrial nanofluids by natural propulsion like cilia movement and self-generated contraction-relaxation of flexible walls has significant applications in numerous emerging technologies. Inspired by multi-disciplinary progress and innovation in this direction, a thermo-fluid mechanical model is proposed to study the entropy generation and convective heat transfer of nanofluids fabricated by the dispersion of single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) nanoparticles in water as the base fluid. The regime studied comprises heat transfer and steady, viscous, incompressible flow, induced by metachronal wave propulsion due to beating cilia, through a cylindrical tube containing a sparse (i.e., high permeability) homogenous porous medium. The flow is of the creeping type and is restricted under the low Reynolds number and long wavelength approximations. Slip effects at the wall are incorporated and the generalized Darcy drag-force model is utilized to mimic porous media effects. Cilia boundary conditions for velocity components are employed to determine analytical solutions to the resulting non-dimensionalized boundary value problem. The influence of pertinent physical parameters on temperature, axial velocity, pressure rise and pressure gradient, entropy generation function, Bejan number and stream-line distributions are computed numerically. A comparative study between SWCNT-nanofluids and pure water is also computed. The computations demonstrate that axial flow is accelerated with increasing slip parameter and Darcy number and is greater for SWCNT-nanofluids than for pure water. Furthermore the size of the bolus for SWCNT-nanofluids is larger than that of the pure water. The study is applicable in designing and fabricating nanoscale and microfluidics devices, artificial cilia and biomimetic micro-pumps. © 2018, China Ship Scientific Research Center.},

abstract={In this article, effects of heat and mass transfer on MHD peristaltic motion of solid particles in a dusty fluid are investigated. The effects of nonlinear thermal radiation and Hall current are also taken into account. The relevant flow analysis is modelled for fluid phase and dust phase in wave frame by means of Casson fluid model. Computation of solutions is presented for velocity profile, temperature profile and concentration profile. The effects of all the physical parameters such as particle volume fraction, Hartmann number, Hall Effect, Prandtl number, Eckert number, Schmidt number and Soret number are discussed mathematically and graphically. It is noted that the influence of magnetic field and particle volume fraction opposes the flow. Also, the impact of particle volume fraction is quite opposite on temperature and concentration profile.

In this paper, Optimal PMU Placement (OPP) problem is solved to obtain the complete observability of power system with minimum number of PMUs under normal and abnormal operating conditions. The proposed OPP problem determines coordinated observability considering multiple contingency cases: single line outage, double line outage resulting in bus isolation, single PMU loss resulting in communication failure. Integer Linear Programming (ILP) is used to determine optimal number and locations for OPP problem. Moreover, Optimal PMU placement problem with conventional measurements is modified for incorporation of bus isolation caused due to contingency. The effectiveness of proposed methodology has been tested on IEEE 14-bus system and New England 39-bus power system. The results highlight the practical suitability of the proposed approach at the control centers. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={In this investigation, we study an M/Hk/1 queue with a unreliable changeable server with state dependent rate and setup under N-policy. Arrival of the customers follows Poisson distribution dependent upon the server's state. The service of the customer starts only when at least N customers are there in the system and turns off when system becomes empty. Queue size distribution is obtained using Generating function method. We derive cost function in term of cost elements related to different situations and determine the optimal operating policy. Sensitivity exploration has been done in order to explore the outcome of dissimilar parameters on cost incurred, threshold level and other indices. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={While extracting land cover from remote sensing images, each pixel in the image is allocated to one of the possible class. In reality different land covers within a pixel can be found due to continuum of variation in landscape and intrinsic mixed nature of most classes. Mixed pixels may not be appropriately processed by traditional image classifiers, which assume that pixels are pure. The existence of mixed pixels led to the development of several approaches for soft (often termed fuzzy in the remote sensing literature) classification in which each pixel is allocated to all classes in varying proportions. However, while the proportions of each land cover within each pixel may be predicted, the spatial location of each land cover within each pixel is not. Thus, it is important to develop and implement a classifier that can work as soft classifiers for landslide identification. This work is an attempt to document and identify landslide areas by five spectral indices using temporal multi-spectral images from IRS-P6 LISS-IV images. To improve the spectral properties of spectral indices for specific class identification (in this case landslide) a Class Based Sensor Independent (CBSI) technique proposed. The result indicates that CBSI based Transformed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (TNDVI) temporal indices data gives better results for landslide identification with minimum entropy and membership range. © Authors 2018.

abstract={In the recent years, the improvement in Internet coverage, speed and a decrease in service cost have made it accessible for the common masses. The Internet which was once used only for reading text or viewing basic images is now witnessing a marked surge in the audio-visual content as well as traffic. Cloud based Content Delivery Network accelerate content delivery for websites and applications as they are served from cloud storage. Cloud CDN (CCDN) lowers network latency, offloads origin, and reduces service costs. In this paper, we propose a 2-tier structure for video streaming, one which uses CCDN and priority based round robin scheduling algorithm and the 2nd which creates a dedicated Peer to Peer network for each video and uses chunk based distribution with videos hashed using DHT. The scheduling algorithm in the 1st tier of our proposed structure efficiently balances load of the central node and the P2P network, along with DHT in the 2nd tier provide for efficient distribution of chunks of videos, reducing the buffer time. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Electro-osmotic peristaltic transport of aqueous nanofluids in a two-dimensional micro-channel is examined analytically. Such flows arise in bio-mimetic pumping systems at the very small scale of interest in physiological treatment e.g. occular drug delivery systems. Complex waveforms are imposed at the walls to mimic sophisticated peristaltic wave propagation scenarios. Nano-particles are assumed to be in local thermal equilibrium. Joule electro-thermal heating is included. The dimensional conservation equations are linearized and transformed from the wave to the fixed (laboratory) frame under lubrication theory approximations. The emerging dimensionless model features a number of important thermo-physical, electrical and nanoscale parameter, namely thermal and solutal (basic density) Grashof numbers, nanoscale Brownian motion parameter, thermophoresis parameter, Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity (maximum electro-osmotic velocity), Debye electrokinetic length and Joule heating to surface heat flux ratio. Closed-form solutions are derived for the nano-particle volume fraction, temperature, axial velocity, averaged volumetric flow rate, pressure difference across one wavelength, skin friction (wall shear stress function), Nusselt number (wall heat transfer rate) and stream function distribution in the wave frame. The influence of selected parameters on these flow variables is studied with the aid of graphs. Bolus formation is also visualized and streamline distributions are observed to be strongly influenced and asymmetric in nature. © 2017 The Society of Powder Technology Japan},

abstract={Metal-halide perovskites are rapidly emerging crystalline materials that are reasonably preferred as leading aspirant for applications in optoelectronic and thermoelectric devices. In this paper, we have thoroughly reviewed and performed calculations to reveal optoelectronic and transport properties for a potential newcomer, Cs2PdX6 (X = Cl, Br) termed as Cesium Palladium Halides (CPH). Outcome of present computations are compared with available results and a reasonable agreement is recorded. Energy band gap computations performed reveal indirect band gap of 2.29 eV for Cs2PdCl6, which substantially reduces to 1.22 eV when ‘Cl’ is replaced by ‘Br’. Optical absorption spectra investigations performed here, in the energy range from 3 to 5 eV confirms effective utilization of these compounds in solar cells and other optoelectronic applications. In addition, the transport properties computations performed using semi-classical Boltzmann theory, shows constant pattern of thermo power near ambient temperature range (200–500 K), which admits possible utilization of these compounds as low temperature thermoelectric materials. Performed ZT calculations demonstrates reasonably good thermoelectric performance for both materials, as there exist minor variation (0.1) in the values over wide temperature ranges i.e. from 100 to 800 K. Further, detailed analysis of transport properties predicts p-type semiconducting nature of the present series of materials. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Moringa oleifera Lam. (vern. Drumstick) is a mineral rich, medicinally important tree species of family Moringaceae. It has a wide range of culinary applications and has bioremediation, nutritional and medicinal properties. Conventionally, seeds of the tree have been used as natural coagulants and flocculents in waste water treatment. Its leaves and bark act as biosorbent for remediation of heavy metals and dyes. The tree provides remedies for a range of diseases and disorders by dint of its unique combination of numerous phytochemicals. Gum exudates of the tree are of immense medicinal importance due to their applications in biodegradable drug delivery systems and in treatment of asthma, dysentery and intestinal cancer. The multidimensional utilities of M. oleifera may cause overexploitation of this tree, posing danger to the existing natural variability in the near future. Therefore, there is a need for conservation of the species for ethnobotanical, pharmacological, nutraceutical and biodiversity purposes. Development of tissue culture propagation methods will assist in preserving some of the germplasm of the species. In the present review, consolidated analysis of the role of biotechnology in conservation and genetic enhancement of nutritional, medicinal and commercial value of the tree has been placed in perspective, together with an up to date review on phytochemical analysis of the plant, and its utility has been discussed to invite the attention of the scientific community to further consider the study of this miracle tree species and its nutritional and pharmaceutical properties. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH},

The requirement of transmission power is directly depends on the distance between the sender and receiver nodes. In this paper, a comparative network life time analysis is done in between the Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) and its variant protocol LEACH-Two Level Cluster Head (LEACH-TLCH) protocol on the basis of energy consumption, residual energy and dead nodes. In this paper Tertiary Head-Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (TH-LEACH), a new energy efficient routing protocol is also proposed. This proposed protocol improves the behavior in terms of number of dead nodes and total energy consumption in the network hence, optimizing network lifetime. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Oxime-modified aluminium(III) isopropoxide, [Al(OiPr){ONC(CH3)2}2] was used as a sol-gel precursor to deposit alumina film on steel substrate by dip coating method. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the above compound indicates its clean one step decomposition to alumina at low temperature, making it a suitable spray pyrolysis deposition (SPD) precursor for deposition of alumina film over steel at 400 °C. The formed alumina films (dip and spray coated) were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopic (EDX) techniques. The XRD patterns of the films suggest deposition of amorphous alumina films while the FTIR and EDX analyses indicate the presence of alumina film on steel substrate. SEM images of coated samples indicate deposition of crack-free alumina films. The thickness of alumina films (dip and spray coated) were found to be in the range of ~ 1.4 ± 0.2 μm as indicated by their cross sectional views. The corrosion protection of the deposited alumina films has been checked by the electrochemical studies; open circuit potential (OCP), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and potentiodynamic polarization. The electrochemical studies suggest corrosion resistive nature of the alumina film in 3.5% (w/v) NaCl solution. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This communication describes a novel design of circularly-polarized (CP) monopole antenna for dual-band performance. The proposed design offers an impedance bandwidth (IBW) of 3.7 GHz in the frequency range 2.9–6.6 GHz in the lower band and 1 GHz (7.7–8.7 GHz) in the upper band. Proposed antenna has a wide CP (3 dB axial-ratio) bandwidth of 2.42 GHz (46.6%) in lower band (4.08–6.5 GHz) and 300 MHz in upper frequency band (8.1–8.4 GHz). The CP bandwidth is achieved through dual orthogonal arms and slanting edge defected ground structure (DGS). Proposed antenna is suitable for the C-Band wireless applications including WLAN, Wi-MAX communication systems. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH},

abstract={A compact dual band-notched Ultra-wideband (UWB) circular monopole antenna that has two parasitic resonators in the ground plane is presented in this paper. The Inverted–U and Iron shaped parasitic resonators are located on the back side of the radiating patch to achieve the band rejection characteristics from 5 to 5.4 GHz for WLAN and 7.8 to 8.4 GHz for ITU band respectively. By cutting a rectangular slot on the ground plane, additional resonance is excited at the higher frequency band, and hence much wider impedance bandwidth can be attained. Applications of the proposed dual band-notched ultra-wideband (UWB) antenna structure with 5.2 GHz and 8.2 GHz center frequencies are demonstrated experimentally. Measured and simulated results of the magnitude of S11, radiation patterns and realized gains show good agreement. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH},

abstract={This study showcases the potential of unnatural amino acids to enable non-natural functions when incorporated in the protein scaffold of heme metalloproteins. For this purpose, a genetically-engineered myoglobin (Mb) mutant was created by incorporating redox-active 3-amino-L-tyrosine (NH2Tyr) into its active site, replacing the distal histidine (H64) with NH2Tyr. In peroxide-shunt assays, this variant exhibits an increased rate of turnover for thioanisole and benzaldehyde oxidation as compared to the wild-type (WT) Mb. Indeed, in the presence of excess hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a 9-fold and 81-fold increase in activity was observed over multiple turnovers for thioanisole sulfoxidation and benzoic acid formation, respectively. The increased oxidation activity in the H64NH2Tyr Mb mutant underlined the role of NH2Tyr in the distal active-site scaffold in peroxide activation. Kinetic, electrochemical, and EPR spectroscopic experiments were performed. On the basis of these studies, it is argued that the single NH2Tyr residue within the Mb variant simultaneously serves the role of the conserved His/Arg-pair within the distal pocket of horseradish peroxidase. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Automatic person identification using face information is very challenging task in the field of computer vision. A simple and efficient face recognition approach based on Gabor phase pattern and Self Organizing Maps is presented here. Histogram of Gabor Phase Pattern is used in proposed approach for feature extraction and Self Organizing maps are used as a classifier to identify whether the given grayscale image belongs to a particular class or not. In contrast to other feature extraction techniques, faster results are obtained using Histogram of Gabor Phase Patterns as feature detection occurs automatically without the need of any training procedure. A series of extensive experiments performed on various databases on MATLAB shows that proposed approach achieved a recognition rate of 97.33%, 96.49% and 94.20% for 7 consecutive trials on ORL, YALE and JAFFE databases respectively. It is demonstrated through experimental results that the proposed approach yields significant gain in terms of computational simplicity and effective accuracy. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Three dyes based on a triphenylamine (TPA) moiety using a silicon bridge have been synthesised, namely CL-1D, CL-OMe and CL-SiMe. Structural benefits of long alkyl chains and electron donor group on photo conversion efficiency (PCE) of dye sensitized solar cells is discussed. A previously synthesised dye, denoted CL-1, which contained long alkyl chains and exhibited an efficiency of 6.90%, was compared with CL-SiMe, which contained shorter alkyl chains and showed and efficiency of 3.41%. A large drop in Jsc and Voc was found to be the reason for the appreciable decline in efficiency for CL-SiMe vis-à-vis CL-1. Electron donor group studies were performed using CL-1D and CL-OMe. CL-1D, which contained bulky aniline electron donor groups, showed an efficiency of 4.20%, whilst CL-OMe, featuring smaller methoxy donor groups had an efficiency of 5.50%. Theoretical UV–Vis absorption spectra were obtained for the CL-1D dye by time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT); the experimental and calculated values of the energy for maximum absorbance were in good agreement with experimental data. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Carbon to nitrogen ratio (C/N) is not the lone limiting factors in biological nutrient removal from municipal wastewaters, but readily biodegradable to slowly biodegradable COD ratio (rbCOD/sbCOD) inter alia governs the process of nutrient removal. An intermittent aeration pre-anoxic sequencing batch reactor was operated at C/N ratio of 3, 7.5, and 10 and at rbCOD/sbCOD ratios of 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5 at different sludge internal recirculation ratios. The increasing trend in nitrogen removal was observed with above mentioned operating parameters. At high C/N and rbCOD/sbCOD ratio of 10 and 0.5 the maximum total nitrogen (TN) removal was 90.7% giving 3.8 mg/L TN in the effluent out of 30 mg/L in the influent. At average sewage quality consisting of C/N and rbCOD/sbCOD ratio of 7.5 and 0.25; the TN removal was not more than 83%. The specific nitrate removal rate varied from 0.010 to 0.022 gNO3-/gVSSa.d (0.015 ± 0.0013) at C/N ratio of 3.0, 0.013–0.018 gNO3-/gVSSa.d (0.017 ± 0.0011) at 7.5 and 0.013–0.015 gNO3-/gVSSa.d (0.014 ± 0.001) at 10. The increase in specific nitrate removal rate was coherent to high rbCOD/sbCOD ratio but as the C/N increased to 10 this effect was nullified. The result conformed to defined stoichiometric model based on C/N, rbCOD/sbCOD and sludge internal recirculation ratios. It will help in further effluent polishing with respect to nutrient removal to achieve desired treated wastewater quality. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The authentication models are utilized among the various network based applications, between various homogeneous and heterogeneous network appliances, Internet of things (IoT) applications, Healthcare applications, etc. The authentication models relies upon the encryption models for the protection of data during the propagation of the keys over the communication media. A weak encryption method may lower the security level of authentication model. The complex encryption models are also considered slower, which eventually increase the authentication delay and decreases the overall performance of authentication models. In this paper, a robust, quick and complex encryption model has been proposed model, which have been defined as the parallel partial model (PPM). The PPM algorithm is capable of keeping the higher level security, while decreased the authentication delay. The PPM method collaborates the improved Advanced Encryption Standard (iAES) and modified Elliptic Curve Cryptography (mECC) to fulfill the need to secure and quick encryption algorithm. The proposed model has been undergone various experimental scenarios, where it has been found improved than the existing model in the terms of bit difference, overall time and average time. © 2017 IEEE.},

The newly conceptualized ARSkNN is another such classification which reduces the runtime in predicting the outcomes and improves overall accuracy percentage of the predicted classes over Traditional k-NN.

abstract={Object detection (Mohan et al. in PAMI, 2001 [1]; Lowe in IJCV 60(2):91–110, 2004 [2]) is one of the pivotal computer vision problems, which is still welcoming new and improved solutions. This area of object detection has seen many attempts made toward the detection of different objects. In this paper, we described a method of bottle detection based on histogram of oriented gradients which proves to be superior to the rest, in terms of both detection rate and error rate when used with a linear SVM classifier. This work is to serve the purpose of water bottle detection and classification in a video feed captured by a robot in the office to serve the needs of person. This will help in automating the servant work and reduce human involvement as well as dependency. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.},

abstract={This paper deals with identifying the cancer affected region of the brain. Many tools and techniques such as self-organising map (SOM), Proximal Support Vector Machine (PSVM) classifiers etc. exist to find out the cancer affected region in the brain. But the rapid growth in brain tumour cases in recent past indicates that the existing technologies have failed to identify its root cause as identification is a complex process and recent studies also reveal that different types of brain tumours can be treated either through surgery or in rare cases, with radiation. Image segmentation helps in identifying brain tumours, by calculating the volume and the growth of the tumours using techniques like human edge correction, outer edge colouring and interactive threshold holdings. In order to reduce the human error and to get the accurate results in MRI images there is an urgent need to find out an automatic or semi-automatic method for the classification of brain tumour images. The paper presents a ‘hybrid SP’ classifier and discusses its results in the detection and classification of brain cancer. Copyright © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={The main objective of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) is to improve driver safety and traffic efficiency. Most of VANET applications are based on periodic exchange of safety messages between nearby vehicles and between vehicles and nearby road side communication units (e.g., traffic lights, roadside lights etc.). This periodic communication generates huge amount of data that have typical storage, computation, and communication resources needs. In recent years, there have been huge developments in automotive industry, computing, and communication technologies. This has led Vehicular Cloud Computing (VCC) as a solution to satisfy the requirements of VANETs such as computing, storage, and networking resources. Fog computing is a standard that comprehends cloud computing and related services to the proximity of a network. Since VANET applications have special mobility, low latency, and location awareness requirement. Fog computing plays a significant role in VANET applications and services. In this paper, we present real-time applications of VANET that can be implemented using fog computing. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={The rapid increase in population of India forced people to migrate from rural areas and small towns to metropolitan cities for better employment, education, and, good lifestyle. Major cities of India were industrialized and required more work force in metropolitan cities, leading to uncoordinated and unplanned growth, often termed as urban sprawl. Urban sprawl destroyed the natural resources such as open green space, agricultural land, open water bodies and ground water. In this paper, an attempt has been made to monitor urban sprawl using Shannon’s Entropy model, Remote Sensing, and GIS for city Jaipur, India. The changed entropy value during the years 1972-2013 proves more dispersed growth in the city. The built-up area of Jaipur has increased from 40 km2 in 1972 to 400 km2 in 2013. Land use percentage of urban settlement is doubled as compared to the urban population of Jaipur during 1972-2013. This study shows remarkable urban sprawl in fringe areas of Jaipur city in the last 41 years. © 2019 by IGI Global.},

abstract={Sudoku is one of the most popular puzzle games of all time. Today, Sudoku is based on simple rules of placing the numbers from 1 to 9 in the empty cells of the Sudoku board. After solving the Sudoku, each row, column, and mini grid should have only one occurrence of each digit between 1 and 9. There are various approaches introduced to solve the Sudoku game till now. The solutions in the state of art are computationally complex as the algorithmic complexity for the solution falls under the class of NP-complete. The paper discusses various solutions for the problem along with their pros and cons. The paper also discusses the performance of a serial version solution with respect to execution time taken to solve Sudoku. With certain modifications and assumptions to the serial version code, we have evaluated the possible solution and bottleneck in the parallel approach. The results have been evaluated for the parallelized algorithm on a normal user machine first, and then on a supercomputing solution box PARAMSHAVAK. Finally, the paper is concluded with the analysis of all the three solution aspects proposed. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

This paper proposes an Intrusion Detection System based on the density maximization-based fuzzy c-means clustering (DM-FCC). In this approach, cluster efficiency is improved through a membership matrix generation (MMG) algorithm. Dissimilarity Distance Function (DDF) has been used to compute the distance metric while creating a cluster in proposing an IDS.

abstract={The last decade being a web revolution in the field of electronic media, data and information exchange in various forms has significantly increased. With the advancement in the technological aspects of the communication mechanism, the textual form of data has taken the shape of audiovisual format, and more and more content over internet is being shared in this form. Data sharing in this form calls for the need of high bandwidth consumption which may slow down the network resulting in performance degradation of content delivery networks due to congestion. Several attempts have been made by the researchers to propose various techniques and algorithms to achieve optimal performance of the network resources under high-usage circumstances. But due to high-dense network architectures, the performance implementations of suggested algorithms for congestion may not be able to produce the desired results in real time. In this paper, we have presented an optimized multi-core architecture-based parallel version of two congestion control algorithms—leaky bucket and choke packet. The experimental results over a dense network show that optimized parallel implementation using OpenMP programming specification gets the network rebalancing in a very short span of time as compared to its serial counterpart. The proposed approach runs 60% faster than the serial implementation. The graphical map for the speed up continues to increase with the size of the network and routers. The paper throws the light on the implementation aspects as well as result analysis in detail along with some existing algorithms for the problem. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.},

Effects of mixed convection flow, viscous dissipation and temperature jump are also considered. The governing boundary layer equation and boundary conditions are converted into dimensionless differential equations. These converted equations are solved numerically with Runge-Kutta fourth-order method using the shooting technique. A comparative study of Newtonian fluid (pure water), copper-water nanofluid and aluminum oxide water nanofluid under the influence of various physical parameters for both moving and static wedge have been analyzed and discussed. The results obtained are depicted graphically and in tabular form.

Most of the similarity measures, which are used to classify an instance, are based on geometric model. Their effectiveness decreases with the increases in the number of dimensions. This paper establishes an efficient technique called ARSkNN for finding out class of any given instance using a measure based on an unique similarity, that does no longer compute distance, for k-NN classification. Our empirical results show that ARSkNN classification technique is better than the previous established k-NN classifiers.

abstract={Topological sort referred to as topo sort or topological ordering is defined as constraint-based ordering of nodes (vertices) of graph G or DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph). In other words, it gives a linearized order of graph nodes describing the relationship between the graph vertices. Many applications of various fields in computer science require a constraint-based ordering of tasks and, thus, topological sorting holds a big place of importance for many applications like semantic analysis in compiler design, Gantt chart generation in software project management and many more. In this paper, a parallel version of this ordering algorithm over CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) has been discussed by identifying an approach to process-independent portions of the graph simultaneously for load flow analysis over radial distribution networks. The serial implementation of topological sort has been first discussed followed by its implementation on thread-block architecture of CUDA modifying the serial algorithm. Finally, the efficiency of this parallel version of topo sort has been investigated on various structures of graph modeled from radial distribution networks and has been reported. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Microbial fuel cell is one of the most convenient and cost-effective technology for producing the clean energy. This study explores the exoelectrogenic behavior of Pichia fermentans in a microbial fuel cell. Two different reactor designs (double- and single-chambered) were tested in the presence and in the absence of a mediator (methylene blue). The influence of extracellular polymeric substances in the electricity generation has also been studied. In a double-chambered setup, maximum open circuit voltages were measured as 0.602 and 0.488 V with mediator and without mediator cell, respectively, whereas maximum power densities were measured as 1.23 μWcm−2 and 0.407 μWcm−2, respectively. In addition, maximum open circuit voltages were observed as 0.40 and 0.397 V in a single-chambered fuel cell with and without mediator, respectively. The maximum power density was recorded 1.64 μWcm−2 in the presence of a mediator, whereas the same was found as 0.643 μWcm−2 in the absence of mediator. Thus, these results indicate that P. fermentans has the ability to produce high power density under microaerophilic conditions with mediator in a single-chambered membrane less setup. © 2018 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan},

abstract={Question answering field has evolved alongside the Natural Language processing. There are several small-scale applications that use the linguistic, semantic, and syntactic interpretations of text and consume it in further processing. In case of a web search, knowing what the query is intended for can save hours of CPU processing and decrease response time tremendously. We have taken a small step in this direction by treating the query as a question and classifying it with the best suited classification algorithm. In this paper, we have tried to find out that when a perfect-informer of the question (knowing what is asked) is provided as an input for classification algorithms like SVN, Naïve Base, and decision tree, we want to observe their accuracy on the same data set of questions. In our experiment, we have used the concept of CRF to find question features that are relevant. CRF is a probabilistic model that treats features as observation sequence and emits all sequence labels with probability values. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

Cu-tool electrodes (having helical-threads) have being given rotational motion for effective flushing of debris, reducing formation of recast layer with less tool wear. EDM performance measure viz. tool wear rate has been evaluated against the variation of tool diameter, discharge current, pulse-on time, pulse-off time, tool rotation and depth of hole using Taguchi's method. The results reported that hole depth and discharge current are the two most significant process parameters effecting tool wear rate (TWR).

abstract={Crimes are treacherous and common social problem faced worldwide. Crimes affect the quality of life, economic growth, and reputation of a nation. There has been an enormous increase in crime rate in the last few years. In order to reduce the crime rate, the law enforcements need to take the preventive measures. With the aim of securing the society from crimes, there is a need for advanced systems and new approaches for improving the crime analytics for protecting their communities. Accurate real-time crime predictions help to reduce the crime rate but remains challenging problem for the scientific community as crime occurrences depend on many complex factors. In this work, various visualizing techniques and machine learning algorithms are adopted for predicting the crime distribution over an area. In the first step, the raw datasets were processed and visualized based on the need. Afterwards, machine learning algorithms were used to extract the knowledge out of these large datasets and discover the hidden relationships among the data which is further used to report and discover the crime patterns that is valuable for crime analysts to analyse these crime networks by the means of various interactive visualizations for crime prediction and hence is supportive in prevention of crimes. © 2018 The Authors.

abstract={Sign language is a gesture-based language for communication of deaf people. It is basically a nonverbal symbolic language which is usually used to speak with and by deaf people. Indian sign language is a linguistically under-investigated language. Research on Indian sign language linguistics is also limited because of unavailability of standard sign dictionary and the unavailability of such tools which provide any education for Indian sign language. In the interpretation between sign language and verbal spoken language, there is an intermediate step in which the sign language needs to be represented by some written notation. However, there is as yet no standard notation for Indian sign language. In this paper, we investigate intermediate notation form for sign language as suitable for the machine translation. We also discuss the challenges of other linguistic issues for machine translation on Indian sign language. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.},

The numbers of the vehicles are growing very rapidly which produced the problem of the parking. There are diverse techniques that have been introduced by many researchers those are used according to the need and scale. This paper is addressed the problem of vehicle parking for small scale by using the surveillance camera. A background subtraction is used to detect moving vehicle. The moving vehicles are tracked using the Gaussian mixture model and a foreground mask is created. Dilation is applied to remove inconsistent and noise particles. The variable intensity distribution is plotted on a histogram and changes are identified to count vehicles. Each parking spot can accommodate only certain numbers of vehicle. If the count has reached the maximum limit then the display unit guides the driver to next available parking spot. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Topology control (TC) in wireless networks lowers the energy consumption and also minimizes the transmission power. Therefore, energy saving is of supreme importance and is demonstrated by large number of algorithms, methods and protocols proposed for this cause. However, in the context of wireless sensor networks (WSNs), the principle of connected dominating set (CDS) has emerged out as the most popular method for energy efficient TC. This paper presents the performance evaluation of a CDS-based TC algorithm to develop a reduced topology with very low complexity and minimum the need of location information. The simulation results demonstrate the performance of algorithm in terms of low message overhead under reduced topology with a reasonable amount of energy consumption. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={With the growth of civilization the demand of cement concrete is increasing rapidly which increase the production of cement and abolishing the natural source of limestone. Also contributing a lot to the global warming by generating huge amount of carbon-di-oxide. Therefore the present study concentrate on the production of concrete using the geopolymerization technology which replaces cement fully by fly ash, a waste material and alkali solution. India is presently producing approximately 190 million tons of fly ash every year from moreover 145 power plants. Present research is focused on the different parameters which are curing temperature, ratio of sodium silicate to sodium hydroxide, molarity of sodium hydroxide, curing type and the results have been studied and discussed. Previous works emphasis that only the use of fly ash as the base material confine the concrete to be heat cured which limits the applicability of geopolymer concrete to cast-in-situ conditions. So some proportion of flyash is replaced by ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) and the effect on compressive and tensile strength is observed. Ambient temperature dry curing was done without any water when some proportion of fly ash was replaced by GGBFS. The ratio of sodium silicate solution to sodium hydroxide solution by mass was kept fixed at 2.5 and the concentration of sodium hydroxide was kept 14M. The ratio of flyash to alkali solution was kept 0.35 & 0.40. Replacing 40% of Flyash by GGBFS and keeping the concentration of NaOH as 14M at ambient temperature, the compressive strength encountered was 40 MPa. © 2018 Authors.},

Partial differential equations governing flow and heat transfer have been transformed into non-linear ordinary differential equations by using suitable similarity transformations. These non-linear differential equations have been solved numerically by using shooting techniques with fourth order Runge-Kutta method. Effects of Casson fluid parameter β, rotation parameter λ, Prandtl number Pr and magnetic field parameter M on velocity profile, temperature profile and skin friction number have been analyzed and depicted through graphs and tables.

abstract={The quick extension of mobile big data by telecoms vendors, has presented a flexible worldwide platform that creates a user interface for many app data bases or app stores. Big data is a tremendously well-known idea, however what are we truly talking about? From a security point of view, there are two particular issues: securing the app stores or app databases with its source of information in big data context and utilizing big data procedures to break down, and even anticipate, security flaws. The main issue arise that many hackers or attackers are targeting mobile big data in the form of signaling big data, mobile traffic big data, location-based big data, and heterogeneous data in app store. In this paper, we are taking Android-based mobile operating system for experimental setup. This paper contains an extraction technique to extract the malware in different big data context and also analysis of these malware.

abstract={Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) are fast replacing incandescent lamps and CFLs in most of the developing nations. The reason can be attributed mainly to the enhanced lifetime and less energy consumption as compared to the other mentioned types. However one important aspect needs attention, the impact of driver on LEDs. LEDs are current controlled devices and hence emit maximum light with increase in current input to the device. This feature, boost up the light output but it increases the junction temperature of the device. Hence additional heat sinks are required to vent out the excessive heat generated due to increase current input to the LEDs. Those additional heat sinks are at times difficult to accommodate. So, designers have made arrangements to vent out the heat from the device. This is achieved by designing fins. However this arrangement is not suitable in places where the ambient temperature is more than normal. Thus, design of LED driver with controlled current input is essential in order to maintain the thermal limit of the device. Secondly, the AC-DC LEDs driver circuits, which are available in the market, are seldom equipped with input power factor and THD improvement circuitry as prescribed in IEC61000- 3-2. This is essential for maintaining the energy efficiency of the nearest utility services and in addition also improves on the current drawn by the device. The following work envisages these issues and proposes corrective driver circuit based on two different driver topologies, buck-boost topology and flyback topology. Both these topologies are proposed in order to address the aspects of power quality and its impact on the life of the device. The simulation were done using Green Point simulation tool from On Semiconductors. © 2018, LLC Editorial of Journal "Light Technik". All rights reserved.},

abstract={The present paper is aimed to study the buckling and postbuckling response of functionally graded carbon nanotube (FG-CNT)- magnesium (Mg) nanocomposite plate with interphase effect. Interphase zone is characterized by employing a cohesive zone model for its elastic modulus and thickness. An equivalent solid fiber (ESF) of CNT and interphase is modeled and dispersed into the matrix material by utilizing random sequential adsorption (RSA) technique. The effective elastic properties of the nanocomposite are computed by finite element method (FEM) based numerical homogenization technique. The obtained elastic properties of nanocomposite are utilized to investigate the buckling and post-buckling behaviour of different functionally graded (i.e., FG) nanocomposite plates modeled by varying the volume fraction of CNT/ESF along thickness direction, under in-plane compressive loads. The non-linear formulation is based on first-order shear deformation theory and von Karman's assumptions. It is found that considering the interphase between CNT and Mg matrix would result in decrease in buckling load and postbuckling strength of FG-CNT-reinforced nanocomposite plate as compared to nanocomposite without interphase. It is also reported that the higher volume fraction of CNTs near top and bottom surfaces than the middle portion of nanocomposite plate provide better resistance to buckling and postbuckling. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.},

abstract={Region duplication or copy–move forgery is an attack in which a region of an image is copied and pasted onto another location of the same image. In the recent state–of–the–art, a number of key–point based methods have been proposed for copy–move forgery detection in digital images. Though the problems of re–scaling and rotation in region duplication, have been sufficiently investigated using key–point based methods, post-processing based attacks such as flip, blur, brightness and noise, remain an open challenge in this field. In this paper, we address the problem of copy–move forgery detection in images, plus aim to identify copied regions, having undergone different geometric (such as rotation, re–scale), and post–processing attacks (such as Gaussian noise, blurring and brightness adjustment). In the proposed algorithm we introduce a region based key–point selection concept, which is considerably more discriminative than single SIFT key–point extraction. In this work, we apply Centroid Linkage Clustering, to identify duplicated regions in an image, from matched key-points. Also, we introduce a Graph Similarity Matching algorithm, to optimize false matches. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method in terms of forgery detection and localization efficiency, for a wide range of geometric and post-processing based attacks in region duplication. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={This study has been conducted on mining areas of Gua and Banduhurang in Jharkhand State, India, Barbil in Orissa State, India and Mines d’Arlit, Niger. Data from the corresponding sensors of EO-I, LANDSAT and IRS (i.e., Hyperion, ETM+ and LISS III respectively) were used to discriminate satellite signals of Hematite and Uranium ores from these locations. For the data of Hyperion being hyper-spectral, correction mechanism were performed through relevant algorithms: Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Hypercube (FLAASH) to remove atmospheric aerosol effects, Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) to remove noise, Pixel Purity Index (PPI) to get spectrally the most pure pixel and Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) in order to match the spectral similarity between an image pixel spectrum and a referenced spectrum. The data achieved from ETM+ had line-stripping, and thus were restored. On the LISS III data, vegetation had to be, virtually, removed from the images of the Indian sites, using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), in order to equate them with that from the Niger site. The processed data was put to a common platform statistically. Segregation of Uranium, a radioactive ore, from Hematite, a non-radioactive iron ore, could be achieved up to 82.35% using TOPSIS and 90% using pair-wise Student’s t-Test. The technique of Band Ratio was also carried out and an index was generated to isolate these mines from their surroundings. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.},

abstract={Background: A microbial electrochemical cell was designed for lignin depolymerization. Alkali-extracted wheat straw lignin was used as catholyte in a microbial fuel cell and operated for six days. At the cathode, lignin was depolymerized by H2O2, produced during microbial fuel cell operation. Results: The power density reached its maximum over two to three days (0.58 µW cm−2), and declined thereafter. Fourier transform infrared analysis of the residual lignin indicated the cleavage of C–O–C (β-O-4) bonds without disturbing the phenolic ring structure and high-power liquid chromatography analysis confirmed the presence of vanillin in the depolymerized sample. Conclusion: The proposed strategy involves a self-sustainable microbial electrochemical process to convert complex lignin into low molecular weight value-added aromatic chemicals such as vanillin. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry},

Speech samples of ID children were recorded from a government-owned special school in India and used for the analysis. Control samples were taken from the author’s institute. Pre-processing techniques were used for better parameterization. Two classifiers, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Linear Discriminant Analysis, were applied to classify between disordered and the normal speech. Cross-validation technique was used to evaluate the reliability of the classifier. This study has discussed the effect on the classification accuracy using different values of frame size, percentage of frame overlapping, α value of pre-emphasis first-order filter and the order p. The experimental calculation interpreted that all the three parameterization techniques can be used for the correct classification of the ID speech from controls and WLPCC features slightly outperform than LPCC and considerably outperforms than LPC features. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Diverse freshwater, marine and terrestrial organisms have evolved the ability to synthesize and accumulate a variety of MAAs to overcome the damaging effects of UV radiations. Cyanobacteria might have faced the most deleterious ultraviolet radiation, which leads to an evolution of ultraviolet protecting molecules such as MAAs for efficient selection in the stressed environment.

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide quantitative analysis of the extant literature on farmer distress resulting from agricultural credit and identify research gaps. Design/methodology/approach: The authors have used the citation analysis which is based on the citation graph. For the current study, the authors have used SCOPUS database. Findings: The study reveals that the farmer distress is one of the social sustainability issues which have attracted major attentions from academia. Most of the studies in recent years are from South Asian perspectives and the extant literature focusing on some of the important issues like farmer challenges and pesticide poisoning. Most of the studies provide anecdotal evidences. Hence, the empirical research is scant. Originality/value: The study is an attempt to provide an in-depth analysis, so that future research directions can be formulated. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Telugu is the standard language used to communicate mainly in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana states with approximately 100 million speakers. Every Telugu word ends with vowels. Automatic speech recognition has major applications in the smart world. Telugu speech recognition has a huge scope of research from past decade. This paper deals with Telugu speech recognition in a speaker-dependent format for 10 words which are numbers from one to ten uttered by 10 speakers which creates a data base of 100 samples. Numbers are very frequently spoken words where recognition of these words plays a major role in Telugu speech recognition. These spoken words are preprocessed using various techniques like de-noising, framing, sampling, transformations, and endpoint detection. Methods like mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and combined MFCC with modified group delay functions (MODGDF) are used for extracting the features. Extracted features are used for training and testing phase. Multilayer perceptron (MLP) and time lagged recurrent neural network (TLRN) patterns are trained and tested. Comparison is done for MLP and TLRN with the feature extraction techniques MFCC and MODGDF-MFCC. Integrated MODGDF-MFCC gives best accuracy in training and testing phases. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

An equivalent solid fibre (ESF) containing GS and the interfacial region is modelled, and that are randomly dispersed into the matrix with the aid of the Boolean based random sequential adsorption (RSA) technique. The elastic constants of the nanocomposite are calculated by the FEM-based homogenization procedure.

abstract={Technologies such as the integration of distributed generations (DGs) and shunt capacitors (SCs) are key for realising smart distribution systems. These technologies may be coordinated together to get better solutions so that distribution systems can achieve optimum performance. This study proposes a long-term distribution system planning methodology to determine the optimal sizing and siting of SCs and mix of dispatchable and intermittent DGs. More practical formulations are suggested while considering realities of modern distribution systems with reference to the stochastic nature of load demand and power generation among distribution buses on account of diversity, variability and uncertainty. The long-term costs in the proposed planning model include several techno-economic and social objectives pertaining to investment, operation and maintenance of these distributed resources and the revenue generated by sale of electricity to customers and the utility grid. The proposed planning model is more practical as it fully considers the system uncertainties and variability in load and power generation which are efficiently handled by introducing deterministic self-adaptive uncertainty model. The case study on a standard test distribution system being modified by wind turbines, photovoltaic generators and microturbines demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The results of study are investigated and presented. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2017},

abstract={Today, clustering for Sensor Node (SN) is a method in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) to diminish the energy consumption of the SN by avoiding long distance communication between the SNs. This will protract the lifetime of sensor networks. However, a cluster head has to perform various tasks such as collection of data from member nodes, aggregation of the collected data, and send that data to the BS. Network load balance is a challenging issue in WSNs for the clustering schemes. Genetic algorithms (GA) with clustering schemes are implemented for better cluster formation. The GA run through again over a large no of iterations to find the optimal solution that leads to premature convergence. The chaotic GA (CGA) will solve this problem by avoiding local convergence, i.e., by choosing a chaotic map to generate the random values instead of traditional random function and improves the performance of the traditional GA. A chaotic GA (CGA) based clustering algorithm for WSNs has been proposed in the proposed work that has better convergence rate for cluster head selection and consequently improves the performance of sensor network. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

All the simulations have been carried out using Forcite module of Material Studio. Mechanical properties with and without reinforcement of CNT have been obtained. It has been found that at room temperature, Young's modulus of DGEBA-DETDA composite is 2.429 GPa while after reinforcement of CNT, Young's modulus increased to 13.27 GPa. The MD simulation results indicate that the Young's modulus of the reinforced composites and the epoxy matrix decrease with increase in strain rate (from 0.0 to 0.1). MD simulation results show that at any given strain rate, CNT reinforced epoxy composite is 5 times stiffer than the pure epoxy matrix. © 2018, Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University.},

abstract={Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is harmful to living organisms, causing damage to macromolecules such as DNA, RNA, proteins and lipids. Available inorganic and organic chemicals used in commercial sunscreen have deleterious activity in vivo. Therefore, there is a need of a safe and natural sunscreen. Cyanobacteria are the impressive source of natural products and they can be exploited industrially. Cyanobacteria synthesize the UV absorbing compounds like mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) and scytonemin. MAAs are water-soluble molecules (188 to 1050 Da) that absorb UV-A and UV-B radiation and disperse the energy as heat. Scytonemin is a lipid soluble pigment (544 Da) having absorption maxima at 380 nm. They are promising natural alternatives for both direct (UV-absorption) and indirect (antioxidant) protection. These molecules show strong photostability and do not have any cytotoxic effects. The search for natural UV protective molecules is relatively recent, providing two commercial products (Helioguard(r) and Helionori(r)) containing MAAs extract from red alga Porphyra umbilicalis. Still commercialization of potential photoprotective molecules is required for the development of a better and safe sunscreen. Therefore, for improvement in their expression levels, a complete understanding of biosynthetic pathway of MAAs and scytonemin is essential. Additionally, an economic and sustainable method for extraction of these molecules from cyanobacteria is also required for large-scale production. Future perspectives include the heterologous expression of MAAs and/or scytonemin in industrially friendly microorganisms in order to co-produce different UV protective molecules and thus cover a broader UV spectrum and simplify the production process. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

abstract={Two rationally designed β-carboline-imidazopyridine hybrid chromofluorescent sensors S1 and S2 have been successfully synthesized and evaluated for the selective sensing of metal ions and anions. The synthesized sensors selectively sense copper ions through a significant color change from colorless to yellow along with a shift in their absorption spectra and enhancement in their emission intensities to 'turn on' the fluorescence mode in preference to other metal ions. Moreover, sensors S1 and S2 also recognize fluoride ions via H-bond interaction and subsequent deprotonation to elicit a color change from colorless to yellow conspicuous to the naked eye. Detailed UV-visible analyses revealed that the sensors interact with copper ions in a 1: 1 binding stoichiometry with a detection range of 10-7 M. In addition, competing binding studies by UV-visible analyses revealed that the sensors exhibit more selectivity toward copper ions in comparison to fluoride ions. These experimental results were further corroborated by DFT (Density Functional Theory) calculations. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.},

This paper deals with the combined techniques and its comparison with individual techniques. The rate of features extracted in joint extraction techniques gives promising results comparatively with individual technique. Techniques MFCC, MODGDF and ZCPA are combined, and joint features are extracted. The next stage is to classify the features where selected technique using neural networks. Features are classified by NTN and MNTN classifiers for speaker-dependent recognition and presented by using closed and open sets. The MNTN is evaluated for several speaker recognition experiments. These include closed- and open-set speaker identification and speaker verification. The MNTN is found to perform better than NTN classifier. Speech recognition rate for Telugu language by combine MFCC, MODGDF and ZCPA extraction techniques using NTN and MNTN classification techniques are compared with excellent results. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={The flow characteristics of nanofluids flow driven by combined effects of electroosmosis and peristalsis are very important for designing bio-mimetic pumping systems at the micro scale of interest in physiological treatment e.g. ocular drug delivery systems. The flow characteristics of thermally developed nanofluids flow are investigated in presence of peristalsis and electroosmosis phenomena. Thermal radiation effect is also introduced. Tapered asymmetric microchannels are imposed at the walls to mimic sophisticated peristaltic wave propagation scenarios. The nanofluid is employed as the working fluid, and the analytical solution for electro-osmotic flow is obtained by virtue of the Debye–Hückel linearization. The dimensional conservation equations are linearized under lubrication theory approximations. The effects of emerging physical parameters namely Grashof numbers, Brownian motion parameter, thermophoresis parameter, Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity, Debye length and thermal radiation on flow characteristics, heat transfer characteristics, and pumping characteristics are computed. Furthermore, an inherent phenomenon of peristaltic pumping known as trapping is also presented graphically under the influence of pertinent parameters and discussed in brief. Validation of present model is also presented. This model is mainly applicable to study cell responses, blood analysis, biomimetic capillary designs, and blood vessel tissue culture systems. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={With the rising of enormous size in any field be in astronomy, health or education. Storage, analysis, and processing of big data are not only the big issue but security of these huge data is now big concern in the field of academia and industry. Network intrusion detection systems detect and stop network behaviors that interrupt or threaten network security. Supervised learning methods for intrusion detection are not so effective in detection of attacks of big data. Unsupervised models are mainly used for the detection of events or attributes that occur together. A new parallel K-medoid clustering method and k-nearest neighbor classification techniques are proposed for intrusion detection for huge amount of data. We have used NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB-15 datasets for experimental work. The results are compared with the proposed method.

abstract={Concurrent workflow scheduling algorithm works in three phases, namely rank computation, tasks selection, and resource selection. In this paper, we introduce a new ranking algorithm that computes the rank of a task, based on its successor rank and its predecessors average communication time, instead of its successors rank. The advantage of this ranking algorithm is that two dependent tasks are assigned to the same machine and as a result the scheduled length is reduced. The task selection phase selects a ready task from each workflow and creates a task pool. The resource selection phase initially assigns tasks using min-min heuristic, after initial assignment, tasks are moved from the highly loaded machines to the lightly loaded machines. Our resource selection algorithm increases the load balance among the resources due to tasks assignment heuristic and reassignment of tasks from the highly loaded machines. The simulation results show that our proposed scheduling algorithm performs better over existing approaches in terms of load balance, makespan and turnaround time. © 2018 Slovak Academy of Sciences.

The deployment of phasor measurement units (PMUs) at key locations provides an opportunity for devising effective power system monitoring and control measures. In this study, a new method is proposed to determine the real-time transient stability status and identification of the coherent generator groups by predicting the rotor angle values following a large disturbance through radial basis function neural network. The first six cycles of synchronously sampled post-fault data measurements from PMUs consisting of rotor angles and voltages of generators are taken as the input to the neural network to predict the future state of the system. The proposed method can also determine the synchronism state of the individual machine in real time.

abstract={Adverse drug reactions represent the unwanted or undesired effects of drugs. Timely extraction of such effects is highly required so that early warnings can be raised against if any serious beforehand to save patients from any further loss. It also helps in framing alternate treatment plan. There are two different ways for identifying the side effects of drugs. First is premarketing trials, which are conducted before floating drugs into market. But this approach is not as effective as these trials are carried out on a restricted population for restricted time. That is why another approach called as postmarketing surveillance is used. Under this approach, data mining techniques have been applied frequently for finding adverse reactions of drugs. But most of the existing techniques are based on the assumption that all attributes are equally responsible for drug side effects which may not be applicable for all real-life cases. In this paper, we study the role of different patients and drug attributes in manifestation of adverse drug reactions using clustering technique. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.},

abstract={Background: Memories occupy the majority of chip area, and the response time for any system depends on its memory too. So, SRAMs are critical to the speed of processor operations and thus need to be rigorously optimized. The optimizations have to be in such a way that the constraints of better performance as well as reliability are met. Methods/Statistical analysis: The proposed bit cell is compared with conventional 6T bit cell for access time, read stability, on-current,and off-current, and the suitable sense amplifiers and decoder are analyzed. Findings: The proposed architecture for SRAM design meets the criteria of faster access time and read stability as compared to the conventional 6T SRAM. Write 1 operation achieves a rise of 16%, while write 0 and read 1 are better than 6T by 70 and 90%, respectively. The design was implemented on 28 nm FD-SOI platform. Application/Improvements: The proposed design has the better read stability as compared to the conventional 6T SRAM bit cell design. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Background: Human height is a classic polygenic trait and currently available data explains only 10% of the phenotypic variation in height. Almost 60%-80% of the children coming to pediatric and endocrinology outpatient department for the evaluation of short stature are still labeled as idiopathic. Objectives: The aim of this study is to identify various chromosomal alterations causing idiopathic short stature (ISS) and short stature with dysmorphic features not pertaining to known genetic syndromes. Materials and Methods: After exclusion of all nutritional, systemic, endocrine, and syndromic causes of short stature, 19 patients with height <2 standard deviation scores were subjected to chromosomal microarray (CMA) study using Affymetrix CytoScan 750K array and CMA Scanner 3000 platform. Results: We identified total 61 copy-number variant (CNV) and polymorphs (33 gains, 11 loss, and 17 gain-mosaics) not described as normal variants in database of genomic variations. We identified SHOX haploinsufficiency as a cause of short stature in two patients, whereas one patient was gain-mosaic for SHOX. All three had normal conventional karyotype. One of these patients also had deletion of PAX3, which could be the cause of both short stature and associated mild intellectual impairment in this patient. We also found a long noncoding RNA, namely, KIAA0125 and a pseudogene ADAM6 in 18 out of our 19 patients which might have a regulatory role. Conclusion: This study shows that CMA is a very promising tool for the identification of pathogenic CNVs in patients with ISS. It can also help to identify novel genes controlling height and can open up new insight into pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying ISS, and thus may help to unfold new therapeutic targets for treatment of this condition. The association of CNV having genes for long noncoding RNAs, such as KIAA0125 and pseudogene such as ADAM6 with ISS suggest that they may play a role in controlling the expression of height-related genes and it needs further investigations. © 2018 Indian Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism.},

abstract={Over the years, a large array of multimedia services started using mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) due to its attractive features such as low-cost quick deployment, node mobility, and distributed networking. However, multimedia applications also require provisioning of adequate quality of service (QoS) to enhance quality of experience (QoE) of end users. In order to provide QoS in a network, the accurate knowledge of the remaining network resources at any time is the key. But, due to the inherent characteristics of MANETs such as dynamic topology, high bit-error-rate communication channels, and decentralized control, estimating remaining network resources is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel remaining bandwidth estimation algorithm which considers the node (or link) mobility into consideration while performing dynamic bandwidth estimation on a node. The estimated link bandwidth value is then used during the route discovery process to select routes with adequate bandwidth and thus increases the QoS of the data flow. The proposed algorithm is verified using real-time video traffic (i.e., H.264/SVC encoded video traces) using a industry standard simulator called Qualnet. The simulation results show that the proposed approach increases the decision accuracy of the soft admission control process and thus leads to the enhancement of the quality of the received video traffic. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) is a genetic bone disorder which is typically characterized by brittle bones with frequent fractures. It is also known as brittle bone disease. Surgical procedure is one of the ways adopted by clinicians for the management of OI. In recent years, it has however become clear that physical activity is equally important for managing OI in both children and adults. Exogenous mechanical stimulation e.g. prophylactic exercises may be useful in improving the bone mass and strength of OI bones as loading-induced mechanical components e.g. normal strain and canalicular fluid flow stimulate remodeling activities. Several studies have characterized the strain environment in OI bones, whereas, very few studies attempted to characterize the canalicular fluid flow. In the present study, we anticipate that canalicular fluid flow reduces in OI bone as compared to healthy bone under physiological loading. This work accordingly computes the canalicular fluid distribution in the single osteon model of OI and control/normal bones subjected to normal physiological loadings. A transversely isotropic poroelastic model of osteon is developed. Loading is applied in accordance with gait cycles reported for OI and healthy bones. Fluid distribution patterns computed for OI and healthy bones are compared at different time-points of stance phase of the gait cycle. A significant reduction in fluid flow is observed in case of OI bone as compared to healthy bone. This clearly indicates that improvements in physical activities or exercises can be designed to enhance the level of canalicular fluid flow to initiate possible osteogenic activities and the bone.

abstract={A modified microbial polysaccharide based biopolymer has been investigated as a potential candidate towards development of sustainable biomaterials and bioplastics. An in-depth study was carried out to biosynthesize, characterize and assess any possible mutagenic potential and ecotoxicity of the microbial polysaccharide biopolymer. Microstructural investigations using confocal microscopy, Fourier transform (FT)-Raman depth profile mapping and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the biosynthetically modified polysaccharide revealed internal structural perturbations, as well as occlusion of granular pores by extraneous materials. The Raman 3D mapping depth profile along with time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry also indicated important structural and surface modifications, which could be correlated to the production of microbial exopolysaccharides and secondary metabolites. The study then looked into any possible genetic mutation and ecological risks associated with the biosynthetically modified polysaccharide through the investigation of genotoxicity and ecotoxicity. The genotoxicity study was carried out through bacterial reverse gene mutation (Ames) test by using two different strains (TA98 and TA100) of bacteria. The results did not indicate any mutagenic effect against either of the strains used for the biopolymer samples and was found to be genotoxically safe. Ecotoxicity tests, carried out using bioluminescent bacteria Vibrio fisheri further indicated no ecotoxicity within the given experimental conditions. The study measured the half maximal effective concentration (EC50) to cause a 50% decrease in the light output of the bacteria, a measure of ecotoxicological response of the biopolymer. Overall, results from this study indicated that the novel biopolymer was genotoxically and ecotoxically safe, which offers immense potential for future use of this biopolymer. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={An ultra-wideband antenna (UWB) is presented in this paper, having the properties of small size and high return loss. Simulations and measurements show that the antenna which is designed in this paper has nearly omnidirectional radiation patterns on the transmission band and achieves a good gain, which enables it to be used for different UWB applications. It is designed using FR-4 (Lossy) substrate which is low cost and commercially available and the model is validated through extensive simulations performed in CST MWS 2014. The proposed design is achieved using 3 steps with each step resulting in a great enhancement in the bandwidth. The proposed antenna works for frequencies from 8 – 17.6 GHz resulting in a huge bandwidth of 9.6 GHz. The proposed antenna provides this huge bandwidth with a minimal size of 24×28 mm2. The results are evident that the proposed antenna can be used for all Ku-Band (12-18 GHz) and X-Band (8-12 GHz) applications including Radar and Satellite Communications and Weather Monitoring.

For single component, the adsorptive uptake of AN and NB increased and percent removal decreased with an increase in initial adsorbate concentration. The AN loading capacity of GAC was enhanced from 1.41 to 17 mg/g for the changes in initial AN concentration (C0,AN) from 23 to 540 mg/L. Similarly, the NB loading capacity was increased from 2.05 to 37.4 mg/g for the changes in C0,NB from 21 to 392 mg/L. The single component equilibrium adsorption uptake of AN and NB was best-fitted by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) isotherm model. The single-component BET constant, qm, for NB and AN are found to be about 50.01 and 15.57 mg/g, respectively. The equilibrium adsorption capacity data is well represented by extended Langmuir model. Maximum adsorption uptake of the binary system is found to be 81.25 mg/g. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={The semi-arid mangroves of the Gulf of Kachchh, the largest ecosystems on the west coast of India, are poorly studied in terms of vegetation structure and environmental parameters in spite of their conservation significance. Therefore, it is necessary to document the structural features of these mangroves in view of ongoing coastal industrial development. Mangrove forest structure in 10 locations on the northern and southern coasts of the Gulf of Kachchh were assessed using the line intercept transect method. Descriptions included density of young and mature age classes, tree heights, diameters at breast height (DBH) and aboveground biomass, along with seven significant environmental variables. Mature tree densities ranged from 350 to 1567 ind. ha−1, while average height and girth at breast height ranged from 1.0 to 6.8 m and 3.0 to 137.0 cm, respectively. The majority of trees (55.6%) were in ≤ 1.8 m height class followed by a 1.9 to 2.4 m class (25.1%). DBH was most often in class 2 cm or lower than that. Among the canopy index classes, more trees were recorded in class ≤ 2 cm. The regeneration density was greater than the recruitment class. This study indicates that the poor structural attributes of Avicennia marina Vierth. var. acutissima Stapf and Mold dominated mangroves are largely due to aridity induced by scarce and erratic rainfall and high soil and water salinities. The results should be valuable in conserving and sustainably managing these mangroves in the face of developmental activities. © 2018, Northeast Forestry University and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Recently, there is a great concern in developing integrated microfluidic platforms for biological analysis systems that can perform general biochemistry and biological analysis. Dielectrophoresis, the movement of particles in a non-uniform electric field is widely used to separate viable and non viable cells with good efficiency. The present study aims to develop a universal bio-particle separator in a C-serpentine geometry which could separate particles by varying the operating conditions. We present the design, fabrication and testing for continuous separation structure based on dielectrophoretic forces. The C-Serpentine geometry is composed of consecutive C shaped curves to generate a gradient required for the dielectrophoretic effect. Known mixture of viable and non viable cells of Saccharomyces Cerevisiae was selectively trapped using negative dielectrophoretic force generated by microelectrodes. Through measurement of cell count, a trapping efficiency of 86% was obtained for mixed cell suspension and 93–98% trapping efficiency was obtained in case of trapping live and dead yeast cells individually. Also the results show that cell viability was not affected by the separation procedure as percentage of viable cells was calculated to be 96%. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={In our day-to-day life, a system never works on the conditions specified while it was being designed. Hence, it becomes necessary to include the uncertainties present in these systems while obtaining the optimized conditions. These uncertainties present in a reliability model can be handled well if the probabilistic constraints of such models are satisfied. This paper is directed to handle these probabilistic constraints of a reliability-based design optimization model (RBDO). For this purpose, one of the most efficient and precise optimization tools, namely genetic algorithm (GA), has been used. The basic principle of GAs involves the combination of the fittest string structures which are generated through numerous random iterations. The main objective of this paper is to incorporate the efficient function of a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) in a code formulated in ‘C’ language which is designed in a manner such that it is capable to handle the probabilistic constraints of a RBDO model. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.},

abstract={When machine learning algorithms are applied to huge amount of data, we found difficulties to process such huge data. Now new approaches are being adopted because existing machine learning libraries doesn't have enough resources to process large datasets. So new libraries (CUDA, MapReduce, and Dryad) are adding up for concepts like parallel computing. Here we will take account of GraphLab, Apache MahoutTM, and Jubatus to get the exposure of famous academics and industrial results. Looking at the traditional machine learning techniques, tasks like to handle the data which is distributed identically or in batch mode becomes impossible and there is requirement to develop new algorithms to overcome with the existing difficulties faced by these traditional ML algorithms. The objective of this chapter is to provide overall view of developed algorithms and paradigm shifts of current big data analysis using machine learning approach to compute data. Here we will explore that the machine learning field has great impact on cloud computing paradigm. In first step we deploy various tool to the cloud like libraries and statistics tools. In second step we embed plugins with current tools in order to make Hadoop cluster on the cloud so that working programs can run on it. In third step libraries of machine learning algorithms are deployed and used for data intensive computing. © 2018 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The current investigation involves the green synthesis of copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) from an aqueous plant extract of Moringa oleifera Lam by two methods: (I) time-based approach and (II) heat treatment of aqueous solution. Prepared CuNPs were characterised via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and transmission EM. The study also reveals the potential bioactivity of the prepared CuNPs. In vitro anti-microbial efficiency of CuNPs was estimated against bacterial and fungal strains by the agar well diffusion method. Anti-oxidant capacity of CuNPs was determined using ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP), lipid peroxidation (LPO) and peroxidase assays, while the antiplatelet potential was determined by measuring two haemostatic parameters (PT & APTT assay). The minimum inhibitory concentration was observed at 60 µg/ml against Streptomyces griseus and Aspergillus Niger when NPs were prepared by method II. CuNPs prepared by the method I showed higher FRAP and LPO activities, while increased POX activity was found in CuNPs prepared by method II. CuNPs prepared using method I also showed better anti-oxidant and antiplatelet potential. It was observed that M. oleifera-derived CuNPs exhibits strong anti-microbial, anti-oxidant and APTT potential. This indicates potential utilization of green synthesized NPs for various industrial and therapeutic strategies. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2017.},

abstract={Combined effects of thermal radiation and variable viscosity on a time-dependent boundary-layer flow of magnetic nanofluids over a rotating disk in the presence of the porous medium have been numerically investigated. To carry out the study, hydrocarbon based magnetic nanofluid containing magnetite Fe3O4 particles of 10 nm with magnetic phase concentration of 10% has been taken. For numerical solutions of the modelled system containing the governing equation of the flow, a MATLAB tool ODE45 is employed with shooting technique for the initial guess of the unknown boundary conditions. The flow phenomenon and heat transfer on the plate surface are characterised by various flow parameters such as viscosity variations, unsteady rotation parameter, Prandtl number, and radiation parameter. Also, a comparative thermal analysis has been carried out for magnetic nanofluids having three different bases viz. hydrocarbon, fluorocarbon, and water. Results reveal that heat transfer rate of hydrocarbon base magnetic nanofluids is 73.4511% faster than water base magnetic nanofluids, and 239.7458% faster than fluorocarbon base magnetic nanofluids. This enhanced heat transfer capacity of hydrocarbon base magnetic nanofluids will help in improving the performance of oil and ore extraction drilling systems used in mining industry and other geothermal applications. © 2018 Society of Thermal Engineers of Serbia.},

abstract={In this paper, a single notched band at 5.2 GHz with complementary split ring resonator (CSRR) ultra-wideband (UWB) antenna and its implementation in designing of two-element multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) with high and uniform isolation are experimentally demonstrated. The proposed UWB MIMO consists of a T-shaped stub in ground plane in between antenna elements of the size of λat3.1 GHz/4 to achieve minimum 20 dB isolation, which is almost uniform in entire UWB band. The size of the UWB MIMO antenna is 0.31λat3.1 GHz × 0.434λat3.1 GHz × 0.008λat3.1 GHz mm3 , and it is printed on an RT/duroid 5880 substrate (εr = 2.2, tan δ = 0.0009), which leads to good gain and high total efficiency of the antenna in operating bands. The simulated and measured results show good agreement for the impedance bandwidth (|S11 | &lt; −10 dB) and isolation (|S21 | &lt; −20 dB) in most of the operating band, excluding the notched band at 5.2 GHz in UWB range.

abstract={Software-defined networks (SDNs) decouple the data plane from the control plane. Thus, it provides logically centralized visibility of the entire networking infrastructure to the controller. It enables the applications running on top of the control plane to innovate through network management and programmability. To envision the centralized control and visibility, the controller needs to discover the networking topology of the entire SDN infrastructure. However, discovering and maintaining a global view of the underlying network topology is a challenging task because of (i) frequently changing network topology caused by migration of the virtual machines in the data centers, mobile, end hosts and change in the number of data plane switches because of technical faults or network upgrade; (ii) lack of authentication mechanisms and scarcity in SDN standards; and (iii) availability of security solutions during topology discovery process. To this end, the aim of this paper is threefold. First, we investigate the working methodologies used to achieve global view by different SDN controllers, specifically, POX, Ryu, OpenDaylight, Floodlight, Beacon, ONOS, and HPEVAN. Second, we identify vulnerabilities that affect the topology discovery process in the above controller implementation. In particular, we provide a detailed analysis of the threats namely link layer discovery protocol (LLDP) poisoning, LLDP flooding, and LLDP replay attack concerning these controllers. Finally, to countermeasure the identified risks, we propose a novel mechanism called TILAK which generates random MAC destination addresses for LLDP packets and use this randomness to create a flow entry for the LLDP packets. It is a periodic process to prevent LLDP packet-based attacks that are caused only because of lack of verification of source authentication and integrity of LLDP packets. The implementation results for TILAK confirm that it covers targeted threats with lower resource penalty. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Search and retrieval of digital images from huge datasets has become a big problem in modern, medical, and different applications. Content-based image recovery (CBIR) is considered as the best solution for automatic retrieval of images. In such frameworks, in the ordering calculation, a few components are separated from each photo and put away as a record vector. Tamura surface features are applied on digital image and registered the low request measurements from the changed image. The separated surface components of the digital image are used for retrieval. These component mixes incorporate the pixels spatial appropriation data into numerical esteem values. The results demonstrate that this strategy is still compelling when the information scale is extensive, and it has predominant versatility than customary indexing strategies. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018},

abstract={The objective of this paper is to describe the technique of improvement of Ultra Wideband Antennas (UWB) and also how to design them. A simple design, a smaller structure and better return loss is expected from the antenna. The simulations show that that the antennas has a good amplification factor and a nearly omnidirectional properties in the proposed bandwidth region. The substrate used in the designing of this antenna is FR-4 (Lossy) which is a low cost substrate and the designs were simulated extensively using the CST MWS 2014. The progression in the design of this antenna is shown through three successive iterations which progressively further enhances the desired result The final bandwidth in the third iteration operates in the frequency range 3.28-20GHz resulting in a bandwidth of 16.72GHz. The size of the substrate used in this antennas is 25x30 mm2. The results show that the proposed antenna can operate in C Band (4 GHz to 8 GHz), X Band (8 GHz-12GHz) and Ku-Band (12 GHz to 18GHz). Multiple plots describing the gain, radiation efficiency, radiation pattern and surface current have been shown in this paper. © 2018, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.

abstract={This paper proposes a unique microstrip patch antenna which has a hexagonal fractal pattern which can mainly be used for ground based surveillance radar applications. To further optimize the functioning of the antenna, multiple slots have been added to the ground plane, and a stepped pattern has been implemented to increase the current density and the gain. A detailed study of the stages of development of the antenna has been made, illustrating the effect that various design elements have on the operating characteristics of the final design. There is specific emphasis on the use of slots in the ground plane. Variations in return loss, gain, VSWR, operating frequency and bandwidth with changes in the design of the ground plane have been documented. The antenna is designed to perform in the X-band, more specifically around 9 GHz, making it well suited for short range search. The final iteration of the antenna design, including various stages of slotting in the ground plane, works at 8.7 GHz, which is well within the X-band range, and has a return loss of around 30 dB. © 2018 Authors.},

In this paper, on-body performance and analysis of various wearable square-shaped spiral cut MSPAs are investigated by measuring reflection coefficient, radiation pattern and impact of human body equivalent model. This antenna basically covers the industrial, scientific and medical band (ISM 2.45 GHz) which can be used for wearable applications in the field of health care and telemetry. In particular, designing and analysis are focused on the performance of a miniaturized square-shaped spiral cut MSPA for body centric wireless communication. The characterization of proposed antenna is analysed using numerical equivalent of three-layered canonical model of skin, fat and tissue. For all types of wearable square-shaped spiral cut MSPA, the main parameter under study is reflection coefficient and the effect of novel double C structured square-shaped spiral cut MSPA with miniaturized designs. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

They show good corrosion inhibition efficiency; with the inhibition efficiency of MBNH being higher than that of HBNH. The polarisation results indicate that both the inhibitors act as mixed type inhibitors. They follow Langmuir adsorption isotherm.
