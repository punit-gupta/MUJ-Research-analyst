abstract={Second law effects on Williamson fluid flow over a stretching sheet with non-linear convection in the presence of porous media has been done. Variable viscosity, Chemical reaction and non-linear thermal radiation effects has also been analysed. An external inclined magnetic field has been applied and assumed that the effect of induced inclined magnetic field is negligible. By applied suitable similarity transformations, governing equations has been changed into ordinary differential equations, after this the reduced equations are solved numerically by Runge-Kutta fourth order method with shooting technique. The effects of the appropriate parameters on velocity, temperature, concentration and entropy are discussed graphically. © 2019 by American Scientific Publishers.},

abstract={A theoretical model is suggested to examine the consequences of ciliary activity on the propulsion of micropolar fluid through a two-dimensional channel. The inner walls of the channel are carpeted with cilia such that their coordinated beatings produce a metachronal wave. Long wavelength and low Reynolds number approximations are implemented to obtain the exact solutions of the governing differential equations. Special attention is given to investigate the pumping and the trapping characteristics of the micropolar fluid due to ciliary metachronism. The motivation of this study is to understand the mechanisms underlying the transport of human semen through ductuli efferentes. This investigation indicates that the micropolar fluid may describe the behavior of seminal material more realistically as compared to the Newtonian fluid. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Sterculia urens Roxb., has been vastly used in pharma, health care, food, cosmetics, waste management, paper-textile, composite fiber, and leather industries, for a long period of time. Gum exudate of this tree is of high market value, therefore, in the name of its exudate, plant is commonly known as ‘Karaya Gum’ tree. Polymers of karaya gum are ideal choice over synthetic ones because of its natural availability, cost effectiveness, non-hazardous nature, easy recovery, and physicochemical properties. Moreover, the tree is widely used in tribal populations for its indigenous remedies against various ailments like oligospermia, leucorrhoea, constipation, body swelling, throat infection, wound healing, etc. Biochemical analysis authenticates photophysical, photochemical as well as pharmacological uses, and validates ethnobotanical applications by tribal communities up to some extent. The main purpose of this review is to highlight the potential of Sterculia urens, based on its ethnobotanical uses, industrial potential and perspectives of conservation and sustainable management. A comprehensive survey of literature was done to further explore various growth constraints, conservation strategies, and wide industrial applications. Sterculia urens has embraced significant values in international trade market due to its exceptional properties. Also the presence of diverse bioactive compounds has made this plant of interest for scientific research. Owing to the wide range of commercial applications and lack of knowledge regarding the scientific gum tapping methods, the plant has been exploited extensively for its highly valued products, while the propagation in natural habitat has been declining over the past few years. Excessive consumption of karaya gum has resulted in critically low abundance and thus this plant is now considered as endangered plant species in some states of India. Keeping in view its endangered status, conservation, and mass scale production through biotechnological approaches are fruitful towards maintaining its biological abundance. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The pseudorelativistic behaviour of carriers is found in the energy bands of certain class of two dimensional (2D) semi-conducting materials such as phosphorene. In this article, the nonlinear optical response of pseudorelativistic electrons in phosphorene under intense applied electromagnetic field is investigated. Using Floquet theory, we demonstrate the anisotropic behaviour of anomalous Rabi oscillations in phosphorene, which occurs far from the conventional resonance. The role of anisotropy on anomalous Rabi oscillations in phosphorene is also justified numerically. The Bloch-Siegert shift is observed under strong driving field that strongly depends on the anisotropy of the energy bands of phosphorene. A theoretical description of the pump-probe experiment is given to detect the anomalous Rabi oscillations in phosphorene. The differential transmission coefficient shows a sinusoidal behaviour as a function of pump pulse duration whose amplitude exhibits a power law decay, which is quite different from graphene (relativistic fermionic system). So the Floquet theory can be used to characterize the different fermionic systems. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

In order to find the carriers wavefunctions, their localizations and sub-band dispersions in the heterostrcuture, a 6 ×6 K –L Hamiltonian was solved. In addition, the optical and momentum matrix elements were also calculated followed by the calculation of TE and TM optical gain under the applied pressure along [001] and [100] directions. According to the quantitative analysis of the simulated results, it can be suggested that the application of external pressure along [001] direction within TE mode is one of the preferable approaches for the efficient improvement in the gain characteristics of the n-Al0.45Ga0.55As/GaAs0.84P0.16/p-Al0.45Ga0.55As nano-scale hetrostructure based laser performance in the NIR (near ifrared region). © 2018 Elsevier GmbH},

abstract={Bio-based polyurethane (PU) foams were developed from bio-polyol (castor oil-based) in the presence of selective catalyst, surfactant, and blowing agent. Bentonite nanoclay (NC) was incorporated into the bio-polyol mixture as nano-reinforcement, while, triethyl phosphate was used as flame-retardant agent. After fabrication, these bioengineered foam nano-composites were studied for microstructural, mechanical and thermal characterizations. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis indicated the presence of characteristic functionalities within biopolyol segments, which was influenced by reactant activity within the polyurethane (PU) foams. Scanning electron microscopy revealed the cellular morphology of the foam. Thermogravimetric analysis enabled the study of foam decomposition behavior for different sample compositions. Incorporation of NC into pristine foam was found to delay the onset degradation temperature. Flammability studies depicted significant enhancement of flame retardancy with incorporation of NC up to a certain loading level. Compression tests demonstrated that significant improvement of compressive strength properties of foams could be achieved by incorporating bentonite nanoclay, owing to nucleation effect of nanoclay and corresponding enhanced structural integrity. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstract={A large number of mechanism were anticipated for copper since 1988 in NaCl medium. The detail electrochemical behavior leading to the anodic dissolution of copper, however, still remains uncertain. Herein, an Imidazopyrimidine Dye, named, 4-amino-3-(phenyldiazenyl)benzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-2(1H)-one, (APIP) has been used as a copper corrosion inhibitor in 3.5 wt.% (by weight) NaCl solution. The present investigation provides a brief mechanistic overview of the electrochemical mechanism of copper in aerated NaCl solution, simulating a static marine environment, with and without addition of APIP inhibitor. Potentiodynamic polarization (PDP) results confirmed that the APIP can suppress copper corrosion effectively at low concentration in 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution with an inhibition efficiency of 92.79% due to adsorption, along with the prediction of electrochemical mechanism. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements showed that the corrosion inhibition of Cu proceeds via both diffusion and kinetic controlled processes. Adsorption of APIP on copper surface is well fit with the Langmuir isotherm model and mode of adsorption is proposed. Antimicrobial activity was also studied and the result obtained showed ‘‘eco-friendly’’ nature of APIP. Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM), Energy dispersion X-ray (EDX) and Attenuated Total Reflectance-Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) observations of the copper surfaces confirmed the existence of adsorption of APIP thus can be potentially used in industries in which seawater is implied are numerous such as cooling water systems, desalination plants, power plants, and oil production units. Results obtained from theoretical calculations including quantum chemical density functional theory (DFT) method and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations confirms the experimental findings and provide further insight into the mode of adsorption on the copper surface. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Temperature dependent relativistic mean-field (RMF) plus BCS approach has been used for the first time to investigate the anti-bubble effect of the temperature and deformation in the light, medium-heavy and superheavy nuclei. Influence of temperature is studied on density distribution, charge form-factor, single particle (s.p.) energies, occupancy, deformation and the depletion fraction (DF). At T=0, the quenching effect of deformation is predominant. DF is found usually less in oblate deformation than in prolate. DF decreases with increasing prolate deformation even though the 2s-orbit is empty which shows the role of deformation in central depletion apart from the unoccupancy in s-orbit as is usually believed. As T increases, the occupancy of s-orbit increases, shell structure melts, the deformation vanishes and the weakening of central depletion is solely due to the temperature. The bubble effect is eliminated at T≈3–5 MeV as indicated by DF and the charge form factor. The temperature effect is found less prominent in superheavy bubble nuclei where the role of shell effects is indicated. © 2018},

abstract={The study of electroosmotic flow of biorheological fluids has been employed in the advancement of diversified biomicrofluidics systems. To explore more in this field, a mathematical model is developed to investigate the electroosmotic flow of pseudoplastic aqueous nanoliquids in microchannel. A tangent hyperbolic fluid model is employed to describe the rheological behavior of the pseudoplastic fluid. Here, analytical solutions for potential distribution, temperature and nanoparticle fraction are derived and perturbation solution for stream function, pressure gradient and volumetric flow rate are obtained. The convective boundary condition is applied on the channel walls. The authentic assumptions of Debye–Hückel linearization, long wavelength and small Reynold’s number are employed in the dimensional conservative equations. The influences of various emerging parameters are graphically computed for axial velocity, pressure gradient, thermal temperature, nanoparticle volume fraction, skin friction coefficient and Nusselt profiles. To observe the thermal radiation effects, a thermal radiative flux model is also deployed. It is noticed that the heat transfer Biot number increases with increasing thermal temperature; however, a reversed behavior is reported for the nanoparticle volume fraction. Therefore, the present model does not only provide a deep theoretical insight to interpret the electroosmotic flow systems, but it will also be applicable in designing the emerging tool for biomicrofluidic devices/systems under peristalsis mechanisms. © 2019, The Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering.},

abstract={Human malaria, one of the most striking, reemerging infectious diseases, is caused by several types of Plasmodium parasites. Whilst advances have been made in lowering the numbers of cases and deaths, it is clear that a strategy based solely on disease control year on year, without reducing transmission and ultimately eradicating the parasite, is unsustainable. Natural products have served as a template for the design and development of antimalarial drugs currently in the clinic or in the development phase. Artemisinin combine potent, rapid antimalarial activity with a wide therapeutic index and an absence of clinically important resistance. The alkylating ability of artemisinin and its semi-synthetic analogues toward heme related to their antimalarial efficacy are underlined. Although impressive results have already been achieved in malaria research, more systematization and concentration of efforts are required if real breakthroughs are to be made. This review will concisely cover the clinical, preclinical antimalarial and current updates in artemisinin based antimalarial drugs. Diverse classes of semi-synthetic analogs of artemisinin reported in the last decade have also been extensively studied.

abstract={Clustering is a useful technique to create different groups of objects on the basis of their nature. Objects of same group are of similar in nature and differ to the objects of other groups. Clustering has proved its importance in various fields such as information retrieval, bioinformatics, image processing and many others. In this paper, particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique is used with K-harmonic means (KHM) for clustering. PSO overcomes the limitations of KHM like local optimum problem. Fuzzy logic is also employed in this paper to make PSO adaptive in nature by controlling various parameters. The performance of the proposed approach is validated on five benchmark datasets in terms of inter-clustering distance, intra-clustering distance, F-measure and fitness value. The results of proposed approach are compared with well-known conventional clustering techniques such as K-means, KHM and fuzzy C-means along with different state-of-the-art clustering approaches. Two text-based benchmark datasets such as CACM and CISI are also used to test the performance of all clustering approaches. The proposed clustering approach gives better results in comparison with other clustering approaches as clear from both the experimental and statistical analyses. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Purpose: Global competition has intensified pressure on small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to implement lean. Recently, the debate has converged to the role of lean implementation barriers (LIBs). The purpose of this paper is to contribute to this debate by exploring the LIBs in SMEs through three case studies. Design/methodology/approach: A case study approach was employed followed by interpretive structural modelling (ISM) to model the interrelationship among the LIBs. Findings: This study reveals that lack of management commitment, leadership and resources are the key barriers to lean implementation in SMEs in India. Furthermore, poor communication between different levels of the organisation and inadequate dissemination of the knowledge of lean benefits also creates hindrance in lean implementation. Managerial implications of the identified barriers for lean implementation in SMEs have been discussed. Originality/value: The research regarding lean implementation in SMEs is scarce. This study is the first attempt of its kind to identify the lean barriers in a small industry setup through mathematical analysis. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The existence of bubble nuclei identified by the central depletion in nucleonic density is studied for the conventional magic N (Z) = 8, 20, 28, 40, 50, 82, 126 isotones (isotopes) and recently speculated magic N = 164, 184, 228 superheavy isotones. Many new bubble nuclei are predicted in all regions. Study of density profiles, form factor, single particle levels and depletion fraction (DF) across the periodic chart reveals that the central depletion is correlated to shell structure and occurs due to unoccupancy in s-orbit (2s, 3s, 4s) and inversion of (2s, 1d) and (3s, 1h) states in nuclei upto Z ≤ 82. Bubble effect in superheavy region is a signature of the interplay between the Coulomb and nn-interaction where the depletion fraction (DF) is found to increase with Z (Coulomb repulsion) and decrease with isospin. Our results are consistent with the available data. The occupancy in s-state in 34Si increases with temperature which appears to quench the bubble effect. © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={Magnetohydrodynamics plays important role to manipulate the physiological fluids due to magnetic nature of physiological fluids. Magnetohydrodynamics pumps are a robust technology which provide more elegant and sustainable performance compared with conventional medical pumps. To study the effects of suspension of the nanoparticles (drugs) in physiological fluids (blood) flow are important in biomedical science and engineering. Motivated by such applications, an analytical approach is presented to study the nanoparticle shape effects on peristaltic transport of nanofluids in presence of magnetohydrodynamics in the present article. A two dimensional continuity, momentum and energy equations are considered to govern the present biophysical model. The governing equations are also linearized using lubrication theory where we consider the low Reynolds number and long wavelength approximations. Closed form solutions are obtained for axial velocity, axial pressure gradient, temperature, pressure rise, wall shear stress and stream function. The effects of three different type of shapes (bricks, cylinders, and platelets) of nanoparticles on peristaltic pumping characteristics and thermal characteristics are computed with the help of graphical illustrations. The interesting outcomes of this study are relevant to more realistic designs for ocular peristaltic pumps in drug delivery systems. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={In recent time, latency plays a key role in the entire concept of augmented reality as well as in real-time applications. With the innovation in the theory of augmented reality and rapid advancement of real-time applications (robotics), there is a requirement to advance a system or a method to optimize the latency time in various challenging conditions. However, there is no standard method for optimizing glyph detection latency time through the Augmented Reality framework in the literature. Even though, currently some applications are using the marker (glyph) less AR system, there are challenges in the detection of object in real-time application and to overcome this complication, the glyph detection system is proposed. Here, we propose the machine glyph detection algorithm and mathematical formulation which calculate the optimized latency time through the rectifier and infra-red light in challenging conditions. The detection process and position of glyph have been processed by the ‘AForge.NET Framework’ and the POSIT algorithm. The experimentation outcomes calculate the performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of optimizing latency and accuracy. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={In this study, reliability analysis of open source software in an imperfect debugging environment has been discussed by considering the effect of detection rate and the remaining faults in successive releases. First, a modified non-homogeneous Poisson process model is developed in an imperfect debugging environment by assuming that new faults may be introduced in fault detection and correction process. Then, the detection rate and remaining faults of previous release are considered in the modeling and analysis of reliability of the current release. The optimal version-update time is computed using multi-attribute utility theory for these software systems, considering the two main utility factors, namely, rapid release strategy and level of reliability. The proposed models are verified on real data sets and are compared with other existing models. The proposed decision models may be helpful for the software developing management to decide the optimal version update time for open source software. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) are very vulnerable to attacks due to their complex properties such as dynamic topologies, restricted bandwidth, and battery powers of mobile nodes. One of the very popular attacks in MANETs is packet dropping attack. In this paper, intrusion detection systems are developed for detecting the packet dropping attack using Mamdani-type and Sugeno-type fuzzy inference systems. This paper presents the basic difference between Mamdani-type and Sugeno-type fuzzy inference systems. For this purpose, the Qualnet simulator is used to create the scenario of packet dropping attack and MATLAB toolbox is used to analyze the performance of the developed systems. The simulation results demonstrated the performance comparison of both the developed intrusion detection systems in respect to true positive rate and false positive rate and also discussed the advantages of using Sugeno-type model over Mamdani-type model. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.},

Hence, there is a vital requirement for early recognition of toxic nature of these nanoparticles. Computational modelling is an effective approach for the same, which predicts toxicity on the basis of previous experimental data or molecular properties.

abstract={Leakage has been the main issue in SRAM design due to the scaling of CMOS devices. In this paper, a novel technique has been proposed for 8T SRAM to reduce leakage current at 45-nm technology node. Here, we have used three different reverse body biasing techniques to reduce the leakage power. The three techniques used are: clamping of NMOS diode, clamping of PMOS diode, and clamping of NMOS and PMOS diode. Out of the three techniques, leakage current in 8T SRAM was minimum using PMOS clamping diode as compared to other proposed techniques. The supply voltage has been varied from 0.5 to 0.85 V. The leakage current has been reduced by both NMOS and PMOS clamping techniques, but the results for PMOS and NMOS were high as compared to two but lower than that of SRAM cell. The leakage current improved by 3.3x using PMOS technique and 2.7x using NMOS technique at supply voltage of 0.5V. The static power has also been calculated and compared for the three techniques. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

The crimes involving digital tools and devices assist to be the forensic evidences. An upsurge in digital evidences is coalesced with the growing size of storage devices. Pertaining to the ineffectualness of the traditional analysis methods to handle the colossal amount of digital data, the forensic investigators have to adopt big data analytics to store, recover, and analyze the digital evidence. The storage of digital evidence calls for surveillance and security, thereby preserving its evidential significance. The digital analysis and fraud detection make the recovery and storage of digital data achievable by effective data reduction and exploiting the features of data mining for storage and data archive. Advancement with the forensic analysis assures automated management of digital data thus safeguarding the sensitivity of data.

abstract={A lot of movies release every day. Predicting success of a movie is a complex task as various factors influence its performance on the box office. Since a huge amount of capital is involved in the production, marketing, promotion and distribution of movies, it has been a topic of interest not just for the viewers, but also for the media and production houses and all others who are involved in these processes since a long time now. So, we decided to perform a study on this topic. For the study, we are using the IMDB dataset. In this Internet age, online publicity plays a major role in the success of a movie, so we felt the need of including sentiment analysis of tweets related to movies in our study. We used a variety of data mining models to get predictions as accurate as possible. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Steganography is an application for concealed writing. Nowadays, development in the field of electronic media demands highly secure data transfer between computers over the globe. There is a pressing demand to send the secret information in the hidden form. Conceal writing is an ultimate feature of steganography which fulfills this demand. In general; a robust steganography scheme should have better visual imperceptibility of the hidden information with sufficient payload. In this paper, a steganography method based on cryptography is proposed. The proposed scheme uses two processes; first, encrypt the secret plaintext (PT) message followed by secret image generation from this encrypted message. Second, hide this secret image into the cover image using Daubechies discrete wavelet transform operation followed by mixing operation. After performing the Daubechies inverse discrete wavelet transform (IDWT) process, we get the stego image. Stego image visual quality is increased by using Daubechies wavelet. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is shown by experimental results. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Microstrip patch antennas are one of the most widely used antenna structures in communication because of their small size but they also have a disadvantage of having a narrow bandwidth. Here, we have used the superformula given by Gielies, which is used to represent any natural shape mathematically. In this paper, the performance of a triple modified superformula-inspired patch antenna is investigated and all the results are systematically presented. The antenna is designed using Rogers RO4003 substrate (εr = 3.55) and is excited using a CPW feed. The first bandwidth is of 53% at central frequency 1.23 GHz and the second bandwidth is of 52% at central frequency 5.93 GHz. The 5.9 GHz frequency is used by the dedicated short-range communication technology (DSRC). It is used to enhance the safety of transportation. The bandwidth, directivity, and gain have improved drastically than a circular patch antenna. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.},

abstract={Diabetes is one of the major diseases of the population across the world. Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot efficiently use the insulin it produces. In 2014, 8.5% of adults aged 18 years and older had diabetes. In 2012, diabetes was the direct cause of 1.5 million deaths and high blood glucose was the cause of another 2.2 million deaths [1]. Over the time, diabetes can damage the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys, and nerves. Early diagnosis can be made through a relatively inexpensive method of computation. In this paper, Machine Learning, a branch of Artificial Intelligence is used to analyze and make the diabetes prediction model. Various researchers have also been done to predict the diabetes machine learning algorithm, but this is an additional effort in the research work based on a specific type of patient in a specific community. In this research work, a data sample of Pima Indians was taken to predict the possibility of diabetes. Among several algorithms of Machine learning, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was chosen for building the model to predict diabetes. This model is ideal for predicting the possibility of diabetes with 92% accuracy while tested with the sample test data. This model can achieve more accuracy if it is trained with a large sample training data in the future. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.},

abstract={Variations in wavefunction confinement under external uniaxial strain are observed to affect the optical gain obtained in type-II quantum well nanodimension heterostructures. This paper reports the wavefunctions and optical gain realized in In0.3Ga0.7As/GaAs0.4Sb0.6 type-II double QW heterostructure under uniaxial strain along [001]. Energy bands, wavefunctions of confinement states in the structure and optical gain of the heterostructure under electromagnetic field perturbation are presented. The 6 × 6 k·p Hamiltonian matrix is considered, and Luttinger–Kohn model has been applied for the electronic band structure calculations. Optical gain spectra of the double QW nanoheterostructure under external uniaxial strain of 1, 2 and 5 GPa, respectively, is calculated. The optical gain curve shows a significant improvement in gain under external uniaxial strain along [001] at 300 K. For a charge carrier injection of 8 × 1012/cm2, the optical gain is 9170 in x polarization. The heterostructure is seen to be operating in the energy range of 0.65–0.8 eV (1549–1907 nm). Thus, a wide range wavelength tuning can be realized. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.},

Among all, piezoelectric is emerging as a promising conversion transduction mechanism of energy harnessing for artificial nanoswimmer. In this context, in present work, an elastic flagellum of a nanoswimmer is modeled as a cantilever beam and a simulation study is done in COMSOL. The novel design of branched flagellum is conceived, modeled, and simulated. COMSOL simulation studies have been performed to compare the effect of primary and secondary branching in flagellum design in terms of stress and electric potential. Enhancement in stress and electric potential is observed approximately 20 and 15% on increasing secondary branching uniformly on the main structure of cantilever beam towards free end and keeping primary branches constant. An enhanced stress allows for larger efficiency of conversion mechanism and, therefore, it is concluded that branching of flagellum can be pivotal in increasing on-board harnessing of energy for propulsion of nanorobots. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.},

abstract={Steganography is the art of hiding a message within another so that the presence of the hidden message is indiscernible. People who are not intended to be the recipients of the message should not even suspect that a hidden message exists. Text steganography is challenging as it is difficult to hide data in text without affecting the semantics. Retention of the semantics in the generated stego-text is crucial to minimize suspicion.This paper proposes a technique for text steganography using classical language Sanskrit. As Sanskrit is morphologically rich with a very large vocabulary, it is possible to modify the cover text without affecting the semantics. In addition numerical encoding is used to map a Sanskrit character to a numerical value. This helps in hiding the message effectively. Moreover, in this technique, a key is used for additional security. The key is generated dynamically and is appended to the final message to further add security to the proposed method. The proposed method generated stego-texts with syntactic correctness of 96.7%, semantic correctness of 86.6%, and with a suspicion factor of just 23.4% upon evaluation. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019},

abstract={The aim of paper is to reduce the complexity of layered approach in codifying the business solutions by providing the cross-layer integration. In order to migrate from legacy systems to SAP modules, we adopt a 3 tier service-oriented architecture (SOA) using Tuxedo as a middleware, for centralizing all the business flow. This paper consists of an architecture by which the clients place their request through the frontend and the generated request is forwarded to scheduling team which takes care of stock availability. If the stock is available, it prepares a backlog based on it and the logistics part mainly deals with warehouse, logistics and shipment which consist of information about the stock. The challenges of this work lie with the migrating issues like communicating with legacy system E1 with proposed system E2 and the SAP modules as data transfer has to take place in a way which the system understands. We also implement solution which helps the customers in easing the performance of the logistics movements of warehouses. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.},

abstract={In remote locations, the best way to establish a communication infrastructure is to deploy Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network over Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET). However, the node mobility and efficient cross-layer communication between the overlay and MANET routing protocols remains a challenge for reliable data transmission. In this paper, we propose a novel Mobility Aware Cross-layer Routing approach for Peer-to-Peer Networks (MACARON) over MANET. MACARON provides reliable communication and high lifetime routes to support efficient data transmission in the network. For this purpose, it uses cross-layer communications to share routing updates between MANET and overlay routing protocols. MACARON provides guaranteed routes with low path stretch by maintaining O˜(n) routing entries per node, where n is the number of nodes in the network. It provides scalability without using any landmark directory to store routing state, and it can effectively handle moderate mobility by using Last Encounter Routing (LER) protocol. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

The amount of data has been growing at an enormous rate ever since the development of computers and information technology. Many methods and algorithms have been developed in the last half-century to evaluate data and extract useful information to help develop faster. Due to the wide variety of algorithms and different approaches to evaluate data, several algorithms are compared. The performance of any algorithm on a particular dataset cannot be predicted without evaluating it with the same constraints and parameters. The following paper is a comparison between the trivial kNN algorithm and the newly proposed ARSkNN algorithm on classifying two datasets and subsequently evaluating their performance on average accuracy percentage and average runtime parameters. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Climate change and global warming have a destabilizing effect on the global environment, and governmental statutory bodies are emphasizing a reduction of emission coupled with restoration of degraded forest lands as a carbon sequestration–emission reduction (REDD+) initiative. Asphyxiated mangrove soil, existing on the borderline of land and sea, has the highest potential to trap ‘blue carbon’; hence, plantation programs have been initiated around the tropical coasts to restore this unique habitat. This case study provides a cost–benefit and carbon sequestration analysis for planting of five mangrove species (Avicennia marina, Bruguiera sexangula, Ceriops tagal, Rhizophora mucronata and Xylocarpus moluccensis) by various methods in a 102.4-ha area at the Indian Sundarbans. It is estimated that as per the planting methods used in the current study and physio-chemical properties of the sediment, coupled with other local factors such as anthropogenic interventions, Avicennia marina planting by the ‘propagule dibbling’ method is the most cost effective (0.002 Euro/survived plant), with the highest increment (97%) in organic carbon density (OCD), humic acid (100.86%) and fulvic acid (48.78%) over a period of 5 years. Survival rate was highest (82%) for Avicennia marina, planted by the ‘transplanting of nursery-grown seedlings’ method. The drain and trench method resulted in a 55% survival rate for Rhizophora mucronata, but the extra labor investment made this the costliest method (0.13 Euro/survived plant) and also less carbon effective (only 85% increment of OCD in 5 years). Planting methods, sediment quality, tidal inundation and salinity variations can play a major role in blue carbon burial/sequestration in mangrove lands. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},
