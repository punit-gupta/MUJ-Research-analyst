Abstract = {Second law effects on Williamson fluid flow over a stretching sheet with
   non-linear convection in the presence of porous media has been done.
   Variable viscosity, Chemical reaction and non-linear thermal radiation
   effects has also been analysed. An external inclined magnetic field has
   been applied and assumed that the effect of induced inclined magnetic
   field is negligible. By applied suitable similarity transformations,
   governing equations has been changed into ordinary differential
   equations, after this the reduced equations are solved numerically by
   Runge-Kutta fourth order method with shooting technique. The effects of
   the appropriate parameters on velocity, temperature, concentration and
   entropy are discussed graphically.},

Title = {Bio-based engineered nanocomposite foam with enhanced mechanical and
   thermal barrier properties},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {136},
Number = {7},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {Bio-based polyurethane (PU) foams were developed from bio-polyol (castor
   oil-based) in the presence of selective catalyst, surfactant, and
   blowing agent. Bentonite nanoclay (NC) was incorporated into the
   bio-polyol mixture as nano-reinforcement, while, triethyl phosphate was
   used as flame-retardant agent. After fabrication, these bioengineered
   foam nano-composites were studied for microstructural, mechanical and
   thermal characterizations. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
   analysis indicated the presence of characteristic functionalities within
   biopolyol segments, which was influenced by reactant activity within the
   polyurethane (PU) foams. Scanning electron microscopy revealed the
   cellular morphology of the foam. Thermogravimetric analysis enabled the
   study of foam decomposition behavior for different sample compositions.
   Incorporation of NC into pristine foam was found to delay the onset
   degradation temperature. Flammability studies depicted significant
   enhancement of flame retardancy with incorporation of NC up to a certain
   loading level. Compression tests demonstrated that significant
   improvement of compressive strength properties of foams could be
   achieved by incorporating bentonite nanoclay, owing to nucleation effect
   of nanoclay and corresponding enhanced structural integrity. (c) 2018

Title = {A new insight into corrosion inhibition mechanism of copper in aerated
   3.5 wt.\% NaCl solution by eco-friendly Imidazopyrimidine Dye:
   experimental and theoretical approach},
Journal = {CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL},

Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {A large number of mechanism were anticipated for copper since 1988 in
   NaCl medium. The detail electrochemical behavior leading to the anodic
   dissolution of copper, however, still remains uncertain. Herein, an
   Imidazopyrimidine Dye, named, 4-amino-3-(phenyldiazenyl)benzo {[}4,5]
   imidazo {[}1,2-a] pyrimidin-2(1H)-one, (APIP) has been used as a copper
   corrosion inhibitor in 3.5 wt.\% (by weight) NaCl solution. The present
   investigation provides a brief mechanistic overview of the
   electrochemical mechanism of copper in aerated NaCl solution, simulating
   a static marine environment, with and without addition of APIP
   inhibitor. Potentiodynamic polarization (PDP) results confirmed that the
   APIP can suppress copper corrosion effectively at low concentration in
   3.5 wt.\% NaCl solution with an inhibition efficiency of 92.79\% due to
   adsorption, along with the prediction of electrochemical mechanism.
   Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements showed that
   the corrosion inhibition of Cu proceeds via both diffusion and kinetic
   controlled processes. Adsorption of APIP on copper surface is well fit
   with the Langmuir isotherm model and mode of adsorption is proposed.
   Antimicrobial activity was also studied and the result obtained showed
   ``eco-friendly{''} nature of APIP. Field Emission Scanning Electron
   Microscope (FE-SEM), Energy dispersion X-ray (EDX) and Attenuated Total
   Reflectance-Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR)
   observations of the copper surfaces confirmed the existence of
   adsorption of APIP thus can be potentially used in industries in which
   seawater is implied are numerous such as cooling water systems,
   desalination plants, power plants, and oil production units. Results
   obtained from theoretical calculations including quantum chemical
   density functional theory (DFT) method and molecular dynamics (MD)
   simulations confirms the experimental findings and provide further
   insight into the mode of adsorption on the copper surface.},

Abstract = {Analysis, design and simulation of 126 W power supply with better power
   quality are presented in the proposed work to run an auditorium light
   emitting diode (LED) light operating at universal AC input mains (90-270
   V). A single-ended primary inductance converter (SEPIC) topology is
   designed and driven in continuous conduction mode (CCM) with advance
   feedback system to maintain constant voltage at output. A proportional
   integral (PI) controller is also proposed to make the system stable, and
   stability analysis is discussed in detail with the help of transfer
   function derived from the state space model. Bode, Nyquist and Polar
   plots are clearly drawn using the MATLAB tool to claim the system
   stability. For justification of mathematical analysis, a simulation of
   the proposed LED driver is also performed in MATLAB-Simulink using
   sim-power toolbox. The simulation results show the improved value of
   power quality indices like power factor (PF), total harmonic distortion
   (THD) and crest factor (CF) with constant rating of 84 V, 1.5 A at
   output. Improved PF and reduced THD are under the limit of international
   standards like IEC-61000-3-2 Class C requirement.},

Abstract = {Purpose Global competition has intensified pressure on small- and
   medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to implement lean. Recently, the debate
   has converged to the role of lean implementation barriers (LIBs). The
   purpose of this paper is to contribute to this debate by exploring the
   LIBs in SMEs through three case studies. Design/methodology/approach A
   case study approach was employed followed by interpretive structural
   modelling (ISM) to model the interrelationship among the LIBs. Findings
   This study reveals that lack of management commitment, leadership and
   resources are the key barriers to lean implementation in SMEs in India.
   Furthermore, poor communication between different levels of the
   organisation and inadequate dissemination of the knowledge of lean
   benefits also creates hindrance in lean implementation. Managerial
   implications of the identified barriers for lean implementation in SMEs
   have been discussed. Originality/value The research regarding lean
   implementation in SMEs is scarce. This study is the first attempt of its
   kind to identify the lean barriers in a small industry setup through
   mathematical analysis.},

Journal = {3D RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Due to age-bound onset of symptoms used for diagnosis of mild to
   moderate intellectual disability, early diagnosis of these problems has
   long been a difficult issue. The diagnosis includes tests pertaining to
   intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviours including communication
   skills etc. In this paper, it is proposed to use speech features as an
   early indicator of the disorder which can be used to train machine
   learning algorithms for differentiating between speech of normally
   developing children and children with intellectual disability. In this
   paper, speech abnormalities are quantified using acoustic parameters
   including Linear Predictive Cepstral Coefficients, Mel Frequency
   Cepstral Coefficients and spectral features in speech samples of 48
   participants (24 with intellectual disability and 24 age-matched
   controls). A training dataset was created by extracting these features
   which was used for learning by various classifiers. The experiments show
   promising results where Support Vector Machine gives an accuracy of
   98\%. Consequently, a well-trained classification algorithm can be used
   as an aid in early detection of mild to moderate intellectual
   disability.},

Abstract = {The addition of polymer to injection fluid increases the crude oil
   recovery by improved sweep efficiency. Although it is the most widely
   used method for chemical enhanced oil recovery (CEOR), limitations such
   as lower stability of the polymer under reservoir conditions hinder the
   efficiency of the process. In the current study, a novel nanoparticle
   assisted polymer flooding approach was carried out to overcome these
   limitations. To determine whether nanoparticles influence the
   displacement efficiency of the injected fluid, we used a blend of
   xanthan gum and nickel nanoparticles. We have evaluated the changes in
   the dilute solution viscosity of xanthan when the nickel nanoparticles
   are added and have found out that a xanthan-nickel nanoparticles mixture
   has a higher intrinsic viscosity of 55.25 dL/g compared to 49.13 dL/g
   for the gum solution. Efficiency of nanoparticle assisted polymer
   flooding was evaluated in sand packed bioreactors with similar to 0.6 PV
   of residual oil in place (ROIP). Flooding results demonstrated the
   highest recovery of 5.98\% of additional ROIP with xanthan-nickel
   nanoparticle mixture compared to 4.48 and 4.58\% of ROIP during the
   separate flooding of xanthan and nanoparticles, respectively. Results
   suggested the novel nanoparticle assisted polymer flooding approach is
   able to increase oil recovery beyond available methods.},

Title = {Three-layered electro-osmosis modulated blood flow through a

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MECHANICS B-FLUIDS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {72},
Pages = {391-402},
Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {Electrokinetic peristaltic multi-layered transport is considered in a
   micro-channel under the action of an axial electrical field. Three
   different layers i.e. the core layer, intermediate layer and peripheral
   layer are simulated with three different viscosities for each fluid
   layer. The unsteady two-dimensional conservation equations for mass and
   momentum with electrokinetic body forces, are transformed from the wave
   frame to the laboratory frame and the electrical field terms are
   rendered into electrical potential terms via the Poisson-Boltzmann
   equation, Debye length approximation and ionic Nernst-Planck equation.
   The dimensionless emerging linearized electrokinetic boundary value
   problem is solved using integral methods. Closed-form expressions are
   derived for stream functions in the core, intermediate and peripheral
   layers. Expressions are also derived for the core-intermediate interface
   shape and the intermediate-peripheral interface shape. Maximum pressures
   are also computed. To study bolus migration, the range of the trapping
   limit is also determined in the peripheral layer. It is found that in
   the core layer larger boluses are computed in the case of lower
   intermediate layer viscosity relative to peripheral layer viscosity
   although the number of boluses is greater when the intermediate layer
   viscosity exceeds the peripheral layer viscosity. Furthermore, in the
   intermediate layer, stronger concentration of streamlines is computed in
   the lower half space with positive Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity. Also
   negative Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity reduces the core layer (H-1)
   interface shape whereas it enhances the peripheral layer (H) and
   intermediate layer (H-2) shapes. At lower values of volume flow rate
   ratio, hydromechanical efficiency is maximum for positive
   Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity whether intermediate layer viscosity is
   less or greater than peripheral layer viscosity. Finally, greater with
   greater peristaltic wave amplitude and also for positive
   Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity there is an increase in time-averaged
   flow rate, whether intermediate layer viscosity is less or greater than
   peripheral layer viscosity. The analysis is relevant to electro-kinetic
   hemodynamics and bio-micro-fluidics. (C) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS. All

Title = {Hair detection and lesion segmentation in dermoscopic images using
   domain knowledge},
Journal = {MEDICAL \& BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING \& COMPUTING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {56},
Number = {11},
Pages = {2051-2065},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Automated segmentation and dermoscopic hair detection are one of the
   significant challenges in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) of melanocytic
   lesions. Additionally, due to the presence of artifacts and variation in
   skin texture and smooth lesion boundaries, the accuracy of such methods
   gets hampered. The objective of this research is to develop an automated
   hair detection and lesion segmentation algorithm using lesion-specific
   properties to improve the accuracy. The aforementioned objective is
   achieved in two ways. Firstly, a novel hair detection algorithm is
   designed by considering the properties of dermoscopic hair. Second, a
   novel chroma-based geometric deformable model is used to effectively
   differentiate the lesion from the surrounding skin. The speed function
   incorporates the chrominance properties of the lesion to stop evolution
   at the lesion boundary. Automatic initialization of the initial contour
   and chrominance-based speed function aids in providing robust and
   flexible segmentation. The proposed approach is tested on 200 images
   from PH2 and 900 images from ISBI 2016 datasets. Average accuracy,
   sensitivity, specificity, and overlap scores of 93.4, 87.6, 95.3, and
   11.52\% respectively are obtained for the PH2 dataset. Similarly, the
   proposed method resulted in average accuracy, sensitivity, specificity,
   and overlap scores of 94.6, 82.4, 97.2, and 7.20\% respectively for the
   ISBI 2016 dataset. Statistical and quantitative analyses prove the
   reliability of the algorithm for incorporation in CAD systems.},

Abstract = {Synthesis of mono-crystalline Ga2O3 Nanorods was done by sol-gel
   transformation of gallium(III) isopropoxide (Ga(OPri)(3)). XRD studies
   were done to determine the planes and crystal structure of synthesized
   nanorods that showed the synthesis of beta-Ga2O3 (a). TEM studies of
   synthesized Ga2O3 confirmed the synthesis of mono crystalline beta-Ga2O3
   nanorods. To study the effect of precursor chemistry and to determine
   role of precursor structures on the crystal structure, phase and
   morphology of the Ga2O3, a new modified precursor complex was
   synthesized. The reaction of Ga(OPri)(3) with N-phenylsalicylaldimine,
   {[}C6H4(OH)CH = N(C6H5)] in 1:1 M ratio yielded {[}\{(H5C6)N =
   CH-C6H4O\}Ga(OPri)(2)]. The newly synthesized complex was characterized
   by elemental analyses, molecular weight measurement, FT-IR and NMR (H-1
   and C-13) spectral studies. Spectral studies of the modified complex
   suggest the presence of bi-dentate mode of attachment of Schiffs base in
   the solution state. Sol-gel transformations of (\{(H5C6)N =
   CH-C6H4O\}Ga(OPri)(2)] in organic medium, yielded gamma-Ga2O3(b), as
   found by XRD studies. TEM image of the sample (a) revealed the formation
   of nano-rods of oxide with average diameter of similar to 100 nm whereas
   the TEM image of sample (b) showed presence of nano-sized particles of
   oxide with average particle size of 10 nm. Morphological and
   compositional studies of synthesized samples (a) and (b) were carried
   out using SEM and EDX. The method provides a possibility of large scale
   synthesis of dissimilar shaped and pure Ga2O3 nanoparticles.},

Abstract = {The research works in Handwritten Devanagari Characters are continually
   evolving into new challenges, which exposed the new sources of further
   research work like, character normalization, gray-level normalization, a
   discrimination of the similar characters and many more. This paper
   discusses the discrimination of the similar characters, which is one of
   the major sources of classification error. The similar shape character
   has a very minute difference, which is called critical region and used
   to discriminate them by human beings. The primary goal of the current
   work is to identify the critical region of the similar character and use
   the same to generate additional features in order to minimize the
   classification errors in the end results. It is also quite challenging
   to identify the critical region as the characters are written in
   different handwriting styles and fonts. The paper suggestes the Fisher
   linear discriminant model to detect the critical region, which is used
   to extract the additional feature. The experiments work was conducted on
   the standard database, which has 36 172 handwritten Devanagari

Abstract = {Understanding molecular properties of outer membrane channels of
   Gram-negative bacteria is of fundamental significance as they are the
   entry point of polar antibiotics into bacteria. Outer membrane
   proteomics revealed OccK8 (OprE) to be among the five most expressed
   substrate specific channels of the clinically important Pseudomonas
   aeruginosa. The high-resolution Xray structure and electrophysiology
   highlighted a very narrow pore. However, experimental in vitro methods
   showed the transport of natural amino acids and antibiotics, among them
   ceftazidime. We used molecular dynamics simulations to reveal the
   importance of the physicochemical properties of ceftazidime in
   modulating the translocation through OccK8, proposing a
   structure-function relationship. As in general porins, the internal
   electric field favors the translocation of polar molecules by gainful
   energy compensation in the central constriction region. Importantly, the
   comparatively narrow OccK8 pore can undergo a substrate induced
   expansion to accommodate relatively large-sized substrates.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the electrokinetically modulated biomechanical
   transport through a two-dimensional asymmetric microchannel induced by
   peristaltic waves. Electrokinetic transport with peristaltic phenomena
   grabbed a significant attention due to its novel applications in
   engineering. Electrical fields also provide an excellent mode for
   regulating flows. The electrohydrodynamics problem is modified by means
   of Debye-Huckel linearization. Firstly, the governing flow problem is
   described by continuity and momentum equations in the presence of
   electrokinetic forces in Cartesian coordinates, then long wavelength and
   low/zero Reynolds (neglecting the inertial forces) approximations are
   applied to modify the governing flow problem. The resulting differential
   equations are solved analytically in order to obtain exact solutions for
   velocity profile whereas the numerical integration is carried out to
   analyze the pumping characteristics. The physical behaviour of sundry
   parameters is discussed for velocity profile, pressure rise and volume
   flow rate. In particular, the behaviour of electro-osmotic parameter,
   phase difference, and Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity is examined and
   discussed. The trapping mechanism is also visualized by drawing
   streamlines against the governing parameters. The present study offers
   various interesting results that warrant further study on electrokinetic
   transport with peristalsis.},

Journal = {CELLULOSE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {25},
Number = {10},
Pages = {5821-5830},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Here we report, for the first time, development of nanocellulose based
   novel bio-nanocomposite injectable hydrogel scaffold. An integrated
   approach has been used to incorporate ultrafine fluorcanasite (FC)
   glass-ceramic particulates within nanocellulose matrix, synthesized from
   lignocellulosic biomass. Epichlorohydrin (ECH) was used as a chemical
   cross-linking agent for hydrogel synthesis. The compositions and
   properties of bio-nanocomposite hydrogels were controlled by varying the
   loading of FC and ECH. Moreover, microstructural characterizations and
   functional group analysis of synthesized nanocellulose and
   bio-nanocomposite hydrogels were carried out using scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR).
   SEM studies revealed successful extraction of cellulosic nanofibres and
   interconnected porous micro-architecture of injectable hydrogels.
   Incorporation of FC particulates resulted into development of
   well-defined micro-porous morphology. FT-IR studies indicated the
   presence of hydroxyl groups and possible interactions between
   nanocellulose and FC reinforcements. The rheological study of the
   developed injectable hydrogel was carried out at different frequency,
   amplitude and temperature sweeps. The studies revealed that after the
   incorporation of FC, dynamic storage modulus increased, while
   synergistically enhancing the injectability of the bio-nanocomposite
   hydrogels. An optimum loading level of FC reinforcement could also be
   established. Swelling behaviour studies of the hydrogels demonstrated
   higher degree of swelling and enhanced structural integrity with
   incorporation of FC. The novel bio-nanocomposite injectable hydrogels
   developed in this study, could demonstrate promising potential as
   injectable implant material.

Abstract = {Electrokinetic transport of fluids through microchannels by
   micro-pumping and micro-peristaltic pumping has stimulated considerable
   interest in biomedical engineering and other areas of medical
   technology. Deeper elucidation of the fluid dynamics of such transport
   requires the continuous need for more elegant mathematical models and
   numerical simulations, in parallel with laboratory investigations. In
   this article we therefore investigate analytically the unsteady viscous
   flow driven by the combined effects of peristalsis and electro-osmosis
   through microchannel. An integral number of waves propagating in the
   microchannel are considered as a model for transportation of fluid bolus
   along the channel length. Debye-Hiickel linearization is employed to
   evaluate the potential function. Low Reynolds number and large
   wavelength approximations are employed. Closed-form solutions are
   derived for the non-dimensional boundary value problem. The computations
   demonstrate that magnitude of electric potential function is increased
   with a decrease in the thickness of the electrical double layer (EDL).
   Stronger electric field also decelerates the flow and decreases local
   wall shear stress. Hydrodynamic pressure is increased with EDL thickness
   whereas it is suppressed with electric field. Streamline visualization
   reveals that the quantity of trapped bolus is decreased with increase in
   EDL thickness and also with higher external electric field. (C) 2017

Title = {Fair-RTT-DAS: A robust and efficient dynamic adaptive streaming over ICN},
Journal = {COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {129},
Pages = {209-225},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {To sustain the adequate bandwidth demands over rapidly growing
   multimedia traffic and considering the effectiveness of
   Information-Centric Networking (ICN), recently, HTTP based Dynamic
   Adaptive Streaming (DASH) has been introduced over ICN, which
   significantly increases the network bandwidth utilisation. However, we
   identified that the inherent features of ICN also causes new
   vulnerabilities in the network. In this paper, we first propose a novel
   attack called as Bitrate Oscillation Attack (BOA), which exploits
   fundamental ICN characteristics: in-network caching and interest
   aggregation, to disrupt DASH functionality. In particular, the proposed
   attack forces the bitrate and resolution of video received by the
   attacked client to oscillate with high frequency and high amplitude
   during the streaming process. To detect and mitigate BOA, we design and
   implement a reactive countermeasure called Fair-RTT-DAS. Our solution
   ensures efficient bandwidth utilisation and improves the user perceived
   Quality of Experience (QoE) in the presence of varying content source
   locations. For this purpose, Fair-RTT-DAS consider DASH's two
   significant features: round-trip-time (RTT) and throughput fairness. In
   the presence of BOA in a network, our simulation results show an
   increase in the annoyance factor in user's spatial dimension, i.e.,
   increase in oscillation frequency and amplitude. The results also show
   that our countermeasure significantly alleviates these adverse effects
   and makes dynamic adaptive streaming friendly to ICN's implicit
   features.},

   bands, density of states using LCAO scheme and modified Becke-Johnson
   (mBJ) potential within full potential linearized augmented plane wave
   (FP-LAPW) method are also reported. The optical properties like,

   using UV-Vis, FTIR, FESEM, EDX, AFM, TEM and XRD techniques. UV-visible
   spectra indicated the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) at 336 nm. The
   size distribution profiles were analyzed through XRD which revealed the
   crystalline nature of nanoparticles with average size of 45 nm. TEM and
   SEM micrographs showed that the particles are spherical and uneven. FTIR
   spectra reflected the evidence of the presence of anthraquinones,
   possible bio-molecules responsible for stabilization, reduction and

Abstract = {A mathematical model to analyze the effects of electric double layer and
   applied external electric field on peristaltic transport of
   non-Newtonian aqueous solution through a microchannel is presented.
   Ostwald-de Waele power law model is employed to describe the
   non-Newtonian fluid, in an effort to capture the essential biofluid
   dynamics. The governing equations of physical problem are simplified
   using low Reynolds number and long wavelength approximations. Poisson
   Boltzmann equations are also solved under Debye Huckel linearization.
   Following non-dimensional transformation of the linearized boundary
   value problem, closed-form analytical solutions are presented for the
   velocity components, pressure gradient, average flow rate, and stream
   function subject to physically appropriate boundary conditions.
   Validation with existing results is also made. A comparative discussion
   between shear thinning fluid and shear thickening fluids under the
   influences of Debye length and Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity are
   presented numerically. Trapping phenomenon for dilatant fluids and
   pseudoplastic fluids under the electrokinetic phenomenon is also
   computed. This model can help toward designing artificial biomedical
   devices based on microfluidic devices which can also be applicable to
   control the physiological transport.},

Title = {`Nano-immuno test' for the detection of live Mycobacterium avium

Abstract = {Early rapid detection of Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis
   (MAP) bacilli in milk samples is the major challenge since traditional
   culture method is time consuming and laboratory dependent. We report a
   simple, sensitive and specific nano-technology based `Nano-immuno test'
   capable of detecting viable MAP bacilli in the milk samples within 10 h.
   Viable MAP bacilli were captured by MAP specific antibody-conjugated
   magnetic nano-particles using resazurin dye as chromogen. Test was
   optimized using true culture positive (10-bovine and 12-goats) and true
   culture negative (16-bovine and 25-goats) raw milk samples. Domestic
   livestock species in India are endemically infected with MAP. After
   successful optimization, sensitivity and specificity of the `nano-immuno
   test' in goats with respect to milk culture was 91.7\% and 96.0\%,
   respectively. Whereas, it was 90.0\% (sensitivity) and 92.6\%
   (specificity) with respect to IS900 PCR. In bovine milk samples,
   sensitivity and specificity of `nano-immuno test' with respect to milk
   culture was 90.0\% and 93.7\%, respectively. However, with respect to
   IS900 PCR, the sensitivity and specificity was 88.9\% and 94.1\%,
   respectively. Test was validated with field raw milk samples (goats-258
   and bovine-138) collected from domestic livestock species to detect
   live/viable MAP bacilli. Of 138 bovine raw milk samples screened by six
   diagnostic tests, 81 (58.7\%) milk samples were positive for MAP
   infection in one or more than one diagnostic tests. Of 81 (58.7\%)
   positive bovine raw milk samples, only 24 (17.4\%) samples were detected
   positive for the presence of viable MAP bacilli. Of 258 goats raw milk
   samples screened by six diagnostic tests, 141 (54.6\%) were positive for
   MAP infection in one or more than one test. Of 141 (54.6\%) positive raw
   milk samples from goats, only 48 (34.0\%) were detected positive for
   live MAP bacilli. Simplicity and efficiency of this novel `nano-immuno
   test' makes it suitable for wide-scale screening of milk samples in the
   field. Standardization, validation and re-usability of functionalized
   nano-particles and the test was successfully achieved in field samples.
   Test was highly specific, simple to perform and easy to read by naked
   eyes and does not require laboratory support in the performance of test.
   Test has potential to be used as screening test to estimate bio-load of
   MAP in milk samples at National level.},

Abstract = {Here, extracellular synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) was
   carried out by Planococcus plakortidis strain BGCC-51 isolated from dye
   industry effluent soil. The microbes were isolated, screened, and
   characterised by molecular analysis (accession number KX776160). The
   optimisation of synthesis of AgNPs to determine the optimum substrate
   level (1-5 mM), pH (5-9), and temperature (25-55 degrees C) were further
   carried out. P plakortidis strain BGCC-51 gave best yield of AgNPs at
   substrate concentration 5 mM, pH 8, and at 35 degrees C. Synthesised
   AgNPs were characterised by scanning electron microscope and
   high-resolution transmission electron microscope. The size of
   synthesised AgNPs was in the range of 20-40 nm having spherical
   morphology. The AgNPs were found to show antimicrobial activity against
   bacteria such as Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa
   (ATCC 27853), and Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213).},

Volume = {111},

Abstract = {A mathematical model is presented to analyze the unsteady peristaltic
   flow of magnetized viscoelastic fluids through a deformable curved
   channel. The study simulates the bio-inspired pumping of
   electroconductive rheological polymers which possess both
   electroconductive and viscoelastic properties. The Jeffrey viscoelastic
   model is utilized which features both relaxation and retardation terms
   of relevance to real polymers. A magnetic body force is incorporated for
   the influence of static radial magnetic field. The mass and momentum
   conservation equations are formulated in an intrinsic coordinate system
   and transformed with appropriate variables into a nondimensional system
   between the wave and the laboratory frames, under lubrication (i.e., low
   Reynolds number and long wavelength) approximations. Kinematic and
   no-slip boundary conditions are imposed at the channel walls. A magnetic
   body force is incorporated for the influence of static radial magnetic
   field in the primary momentum equation. An analytic approach is employed
   to determine closed-form solutions for stream function, axial pressure
   gradient, and volumetric flow rate. Spatiotemporal plots for pressure
   distribution along the channel (passage) length are presented to study
   the influences of curvature parameter, relaxation-to-retardation time
   ratio (Jeffrey first viscoelastic parameter) and Hartmann number
   (magnetic field parameter). The effects of these parameters on radial
   velocity distributions are also visualized. Cases of trapping and reflux
   in a curved channel are discussed. Streamline distributions are included
   to study trapping phenomena and to investigate more closely the impact
   of curvature, magnetic field, and viscoelastic properties on bolus
   evolution. The reflux or retrograde motion of the particles is studied
   by particle advection based on Lagrangian viewpoint. The simulations
   provide new insight into the mechanisms of pumping of electroconductive
   non-Newtonian liquids in realistic geometries.},

   Properties of Lignocellulosic Structural Reinforcement},

Abstract = {A range of bio-nanocomposites were prepared by incorporation of organo
   modified montmorillonite nanoclay (OMMT) with or without use of aluminum
   hydroxide (Al(OH)(3)) within polylactic acid (PLA) solution.
   Furthermore, the solution was employed for modification of
   ligno-cellulosic (jute) fabric structural reinforcements. The successful
   incorporation of nanofillers within the host polymer, polylactic acid
   (PLA) was confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR).
   Water uptake and swelling behaviour studies revealed that the water
   uptake and swelling ratio of bio-composites reduced significantly as
   compared to pristine jute fabric, whereas upon incorporation of OMMT and
   Al(OH)(3), the water barrier properties reduced even further in the
   developed bio-nanocomposites. The flexural strength of the
   bio-nanocomposites also showed improved mechanical and dimensional
   stability. Synergistic effects of OMMT and Al(OH)(3) were observed in
   enhancing the aforementioned physico-mechanical properties. Scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM) studies revealed microstructural details of
   developed samples. Similarly, the thermo-gravimetric analysis and linear
   burning rate studies of Al(OH)(3) treated bio-nanocomposite materials
   revealed enhanced thermal resistance and reduced flammability
   respectively compared to both pristine woven jute fabric and fabrics
   treated with PLA alone or those without Al(OH)(3). From the above
   results it can safely be said that the bio-nanocomposite material can be
   a prospective candidate for development of flame retardant biopackaging.},

Abstract = {The present study analyzes the heat energy transfer in nano fluids flow
   through the porous stretching surface. Cattanneo-Christov heat flux
   model is employed to study the heat energy transfer. Darcy law is used
   to discuss the flow characteristics over the different types of
   permeable sheets with suction and injection. Nanofluids is considered as
   water based single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and multi-walled
   carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) nanofluids. A comparative study for SWCNT and
   MWCNT is also made. Governing equations are transformed into set of
   ordinary differential equations using similarity transformations. The
   computational results are obtained by using Runge-Kutta fourth order
   method along with shooting technique. Numerical and graphical results
   are presented to discuss the effects of various physical parameters on
   velocity profile, temperature profile, Nusselt number, Sherwood number
   and skin friction coefficient for different type of nanoparticles for
   suction and injection cases. Stream lines and isotherms are also plotted
   for three different cases viz. permeable sheet with suction, impermeable
   sheet and permeable sheet with injection. A comparative analysis with
   existing results is tabulated which validate that the numerical results
   of present study have good correlation with existing results. The
   outcomes of the results show that skin friction coefficient is more for
   SWCNT in caparison of MWCNT and the boundary layer thickness is maximum
   for permeable stretching sheet with suction parameter.},

Abstract = {We report the structural and magnetic properties of as deposited and

   degrees C annealed sample due to the formation of FeSi2 interface alloy
   at the expense of Fe atoms from the layer and Si atoms from the
   substrate. No intermixing between Fe and Au is seen. Corresponding X-ray
   reflectivity (XRR) measurements performed on as deposited sample shows
   clear Kiessig oscillations and can be fitted without considering
   intermixed layer between Fe and Si, while annealed sample shows
   interface mixing leading to an increase in thickness and density. The
   observed results are explained in terms of annealing induced changes at
   the Fe/Si interface which result in the formation of beta-FeSi2 phase.},

Year = {2018},

Pages = {25-37},

Abstract = {The pigment network is considered as one of the most histopathologically
   relevant indicator of melanoma. The objective of this empirical study is
   to design a novel automatic system for detection of pigment network and
   provide a differentiation between typical and atypical network patterns.
   The algorithm design consists a set of sequential stages. Pigment
   network masks are detected using a bank of 2D Gabor filters, and a set
   of pigment network features are extracted to determine the role of
   pigment network in the diagnosis of the lesion. In the second stage, a
   machine learning process is carried out using the rules generated from
   the pigment network masks to identify the typical and atypical pigment
   network patterns. The proposed methodology was tested on the PH2 dataset
   of 200 images, obtaining an average sensitivity of 96\%, specificity of
   100\% and accuracy of 96.7\% for lesion diagnosis, and an average
   sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 84.6\%, 88.7\% and 86.7\%
   respectively, for pigment network classification. The proposed system
   stands out amongst the few state of art literatures reported in the
   context of dermoscopic image analysis in terms of performance and
   methodologies adopted, thus proving the reliability of the proposed
   study. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Two rationally designed -carboline-imidazopyridine hybrid
   chromofluorescent sensors S1 and S2 have been successfully synthesized
   and evaluated for the selective sensing of metal ions and anions. The
   synthesized sensors selectively sense copper ions through a significant
   color change from colorless to yellow along with a shift in their
   absorption spectra and enhancement in their emission intensities to turn
   on' the fluorescence mode in preference to other metal ions. Moreover,
   sensors S1 and S2 also recognize fluoride ions via H-bond interaction
   and subsequent deprotonation to elicit a color change from colorless to
   yellow conspicuous to the naked eye. Detailed UV-visible analyses
   revealed that the sensors interact with copper ions in a 1:1 binding
   stoichiometry with a detection range of 10(-7) M. In addition, competing
   binding studies by UV-visible analyses revealed that the sensors exhibit
   more selectivity toward copper ions in comparison to fluoride ions.
   These experimental results were further corroborated by DFT (Density
   Functional Theory) calculations.},

Title = {In silico modeling of bone adaptation to rest-inserted loading: Strain
   energy density versus fluid flow as stimulus},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {446},
Pages = {110-127},
Month = {JUN 7},
Abstract = {In vivo studies suggest that cyclic and low-magnitude loading can be
   useful over pharmaceutical drugs in normalizing bone loss as it
   encourages osteogenesis (i.e. new bone formation) at the sites of
   elevated strain magnitude. In silico models assumed normal strain or
   strain energy density (SED) as the stimulus to predict loading-induced
   osteogenesis, however, these models may have limited success in fitting
   the in vivo new bone formation at several instances. For example,
   rest-inserted cyclic loading amplifies the new bone formation as
   compared to continuous-cyclic loading even though similar strain
   magnitude were induced in both the cases. It is also believed that
   loading-induced interstitial fluid flow can also be a potential stimulus
   of osteogenesis. The present study hypothesizes that fluid motion as
   osteogenic stimulus may explain the afore-mentioned anomalies.
   Accordingly, this work studies osteogenesis as functions of SED and
   canalicular fluid motion using an in silico model. Therefore, the new
   bone formation is considered roughly proportional to stimuli above their
   osteogenic thresholds. This model attempts to simulate in vivo new bone
   formation noticed in rest-inserted cantilever loading studies. The
   model's prediction of site-specific new bone formation improves when
   fluid flow is considered as the stimulus. It is also noticed that fluid
   motion as the stimulus closely fits the new bone formation for another
   in vivo study where the effects of aging on osteogenesis were examined.
   These attempts to establish fluid flow as a potential osteogenic
   stimulus can be useful in the prediction of site-specific new bone
   formation. The findings will ultimately be useful in designing
   biomechanical interventions such as prophylactic exercises to cure bone
   loss. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we have investigated the effects of multiple slip on
   inclined MHD Casson fluid flow over a permeable stretching surface and a
   melting surface. We have considered first and second order velocity
   slip, non-linear radiation, non-uniform heat source and non-linear
   chemical reaction. The analysis is carried out numerically for the
   momentum, heat and mass equations by solving the bvp4c MATLAB solver.
   The physical features of non-dimensional Casson fluid parameter, Schmidt
   number, Eckert number, variable radiation parameter, porosity parameter,
   variable heat source parameter, Prandtl number, Skin friction
   coefficient, local Nusselt number and local Sherwood number of velocity,
   temperature, volume fraction have been discussed and depicted by the
   graphs and tables. The theta and phi profiles were uplifted with the
   increment of the beta, M and Kp parameters on a suction and melting
   surface whereas the opposite behavior observed on f' profiles and the f'
   profile and momentum boundary layer thickness was depressed with the
   increment of the L-1 and L-2 parameters under a suction and a melting
   surface whereas the reverse behavior observed on theta and phi profiles.
   The impact of various physical parameters of melting surface and porous
   surface are obtained and observed that the effect of melting surface is
   higher than porous surface.},

Year = {2018},
Volume = {12},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Misalignments in gears cause vibrations and contact nonlinearities,
   which in turn cause load distribution shift on the gear tooth. The load
   distribution shift of the gear pair results in increased contact and
   bending stresses with the maximum stresses leaning towards the edge of
   the face width. These stress changes cause failures and gear performance
   variations, such as pitting, scuffing, crack initiation and eventually
   tooth breakage. In this paper, the contact and bending stresses of a
   misaligned spur gear pair were evaluated with and without friction by
   employing corresponding analytical methods and finite element method
   (FEM). Friction coefficient values of 0.1 to 0.3 were used to evaluate
   the effects of friction on contact and bending stress distribution of a
   spur gear pair with axial and angular misalignments. The stress
   concentration was found to be higher at the contact point and at the
   tooth root of the gear with the augmentation of the misalignment
   distance and angle. The maximum contact and bending stresses increased
   by 67.5\% and 18.9\%, respectively, when axial misalignments were
   subjected. Similarly, the maximum contact and bending stresses increased
   by 27.0\% and 62.4\%, respectively, for angular misalignments.
   Furthermore, the contact and bending stresses increased proportionally
   with the increasing coefficient of friction. Finally, the relationships
   between the normalized stress and misalignments (both axial and angular)
   were established.},

Title = {Establishing the relationship between loading parameters and bone
   adaptation},
Journal = {MEDICAL ENGINEERING \& PHYSICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {56},
Pages = {16-26},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Cyclic and low-magnitude loading is considered effective in arresting
   the bone loss as it promotes osteogenesis (i.e. new bone formation) at
   the sites of elevated normal strain magnitude. In silico models assumed
   normal strain as the stimulus to predict the sites of new bone
   formation. These models, however, may fail to fit the amount of newly
   formed bone. Loading parameters such as strain, frequency, and loading
   cycle decide the amount of new bone formation. The models did not
   incorporate this information. In fact, there is no unifying relationship
   to quantify the amount of new bone formation as a function of loading
   parameters. Therefore, the present work aims to establish an empirical
   relationship between loading parameters and a new bone formation
   parameter i.e. mineral apposition rate (MAR). A neural network model is
   used to serve the purpose. Loading parameters are supplied as input,
   whereas, MAR served as output. The model is trained and tested with
   experimental data. The model establishes an empirical relationship to
   estimate MAR as a function of loading parameters. The model's
   predictions of MAR align with in vivo experimental results. The model's
   response is analyzed which indicates that the bone adaptation
   characteristics are successfully captured in the relationship. The
   relationship established may be incorporated further to improve
   qualitative and quantitative prediction capabilities of computer models.
   These findings can be extended in future to design and develop effective
   biomechanical strategies such as prophylactic exercise to cure bone
   loss. (C) 2018 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {To understand the molecular level interaction of Coumarin dopant with

   characterizations of PVA and PMMA self-standing films by doping Coumarin

   PMMA host matrix is more affected by doping in comparison with PVA
   matrix, which shows bond modifications and crystallization with small
   doping. The band-edges are observed to shift, thereby lowering the
   band-gaps of the base polymers upon doping. While the changes are seen
   only below the absorption edge in PVA, PMMA exhibits alterations in both
   the band edge and overall transmission in the range of 300-900 nm. The

Abstract = {A theoretical study is presented of peristaltic hydrodynamics of an
   aqueous electrolytic non-Newtonian Jeffrey bio-rheological fluid through
   an asymmetric microchannel under an applied axial electric field. An
   analytical approach is adopted to obtain the closed form solution for
   velocity, volumetric flow, pressure difference and stream function. The
   analysis is also restricted under the low Reynolds number assumption
   (Stokes flow) and lubrication theory approximations (large wavelength).
   Small ionic Pecl,t number and Debye-Huckel linearization (i.e. wall zeta
   potential ae<currency> 25 mV) are also considered to simplify the
   Nernst-Planck and Poisson-Boltzmann equations. Streamline plots are also
   presented for the different electro-osmotic parameter, varying
   magnitudes of the electric field (both aiding and opposing cases) and
   for different values of the ratio of relaxation to retardation time
   parameter. Comparisons are also included between the Newtonian and
   general non-Newtonian Jeffrey fluid cases. The results presented here
   may be of fundamental interest towards designing lab-on-a-chip devices
   for flow mixing, cell manipulation, micro-scale pumps etc. Trapping is
   shown to be more sensitive to an electric field (aiding, opposing and
   neutral) rather than the electro-osmotic parameter and viscoelastic
   relaxation to retardation ratio parameter. The results may also help
   towards the design of organ-on-a-chip like devices for better drug
   design.},

Abstract = {An analytical analysis is presented in this work to assess the influence
   of micropolar nature of fluids in fully developed flow induced by
   electrokinetically driven peristaltic pumping through a parallel plate
   microchannel. The walls of the channel are assumed as sinusoidal wavy to
   analyze the peristaltic flow nature. We consider that the wavelength of
   the wall motion is much larger as compared to the channel width to
   validate the lubrication theory. To simplify the Poisson Boltzmann
   equation, we also use the Debye-Effickel linearization. We consider
   governing equation for micropolar fluid in absence of body force and
   couple effects however external electric field is employed. The
   solutions for axial velocity, spin velocity, flow rate, pressure rise,
   and stream functions subjected to given physical boundary conditions are
   computed. The effects of pertinent parameters like Debye length and
   Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity which characterize the EDL phenomenon
   and external electric field, coupling number and micropolar parameter

   electroosmosis},

Pages = {28-36},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {An analytical study of microvascular non-Newtonian blood flow is
   conducted incorporating the electro-osmosis phenomenon. Blood is
   considered as a Bingham rheological aqueous ionic solution. An
   externally applied static axial electrical field is imposed on the
   system. The Poisson-Boltzmann equation for electrical potential
   distribution is implemented to accommodate the electrical double layer
   in the microvascular regime. With long wavelength, lubrication and
   Debye-Hiickel approximations, the boundary value problem is rendered
   non-dimensional. Analytical solutions are derived for the axial
   velocity, volumetric flow rate, pressure gradient, volumetric flow rate,
   averaged volumetric flow rate along one time period, pressure rise along
   one wavelength and stream function. A plug swidth is featured in the
   solutions, Via symbolic software (Mathematica), graphical plots are
   generated for the influence of Bingham plug flow width parameter,
   electrical Debye length and Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity (maximum
   electro-osmotic velocity) on the key hydrodynamic variables. This study
   reveals that blood flow rate accelerates with decreasing the plug width
   (i.e. viscoplastic nature of fluids) and also with increasing the Debye
   length parameter.},

   through porous micro vessels altered by electrohydrodynamic},
Journal = {MICROVASCULAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {117},
Pages = {74-89},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {In most of the medical therapies, electromagnetic field plays important
   role to modulate the blood flow and to reduce the pain of human body.
   With this fact, this paper presents a mathematical model to study the
   peristaltic blood flow through porous microvessels in the presence of
   electrohydrodynamics. The effects of Joule heating and different zeta
   potential are also considered. Darcy law is employed for porous medium.
   The mathematical analysis is carried out in the form of electroosmosis,
   flow analysis and heat transfer analysis. Velocity slip conditions are
   imposed to solve momentum equation and thermal energy equation. Time
   dependent volumetric flow rate is considered which varies exponentially.
   Closed form solutions for potential function is obtained under
   Debye-Hiickel approximation and velocity and temperature fields are
   obtained under low Reynolds number and large wavelength approximations.
   The influence of Hartmann number, electroosmotic parameter, slip
   parameters, Zeta potential, and couple stress parameter on flow
   characteristics, pumping characteristics and trapping phenomenon is
   computed. The effects of thermal slip parameters, Joule heating
   parameter, and Brinkman number on heat transfer characteristics are also
   presented graphically. Finally, the effect of Brinkman number on a graph
   between Nusselt number and Joule heating parameter is examined.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to analyze the electroosmotic flow of non-Newtonian
   ionic nanoliquids in presence of peristaltic propulsion. A geometric
   model is employed for a microfluidic tapered channel flow regime.
   Williamson's fluid model is utilized to characterize non-Newtonian
   nature of the base fluid. The normalized governing equations are reduced
   with lubrication approximations (long wavelength and low Reynolds number
   assumptions). Poisson-Boltzmann equation is also simplified by using
   Debye-Huckel linearization. No slip conditions are imposed at the
   channel walls. The analytical solutions are obtained for temperature
   field and nanoparticle volume fraction. However, a perturbation method
   is used to find out an approximate solution for axial velocity, pressure
   rise and volumetric flow rate. The perturbation solutions are further
   graphically illustrated with MATLAB software. The perturbation solution
   is also validated with numerical results simulated by MATLAB coding
   through BVP command. The effects of thermal radiation and non-Newtonian
   parameters on flow characteristics, pumping characteristics, wall shear
   stress and trapping phenomenon are discussed. A comparative study is
   also made to study the electroosmotic flow through uniform and
   nonuniform asymmetric microfluidic channel. This model can help to study
   the intrauterine fluid dynamics governed by electroosmosis mechanism. It
   can also be applicable in drug delivery, in vivo diagnostics, food
   diagnostics, packaging (smart sensors), DNA chips, protein chips and
   cell chips. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {An effective load balancing mechanism maximizes the throughput minimizes

   mechanism. DWLM mechanism based on LP-formulation-based heuristic
   approaches to dynamically manage load balancing. DWLM approaches use
   transfer, selection, and location polices. These policies work based on
   an information policy. The authors map the result in migration time,

Abstract = {The current investigation involves the green synthesis of copper
   nanoparticles (CuNPs) from an aqueous plant extract of Moringa oleifera
   Lam by two methods: (I) time-based approach and (II) heat treatment of
   aqueous solution. Prepared CuNPs were characterised via Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron
   microscopy and transmission EM. The study also reveals the potential
   bioactivity of the prepared CuNPs. In vitro anti-microbial efficiency of
   CuNPs was estimated against bacterial and fungal strains by the agar
   well diffusion method. Anti-oxidant capacity of CuNPs was determined
   using ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP), lipid peroxidation (LPO)
   and peroxidase assays, while the antiplatelet potential was determined
   by measuring two haemostatic parameters (PT \& APTT assay). The minimum
   inhibitory concentration was observed at 60 mu g/ml against Streptomyces
   griseus and Aspergillus niger when NPs were prepared by method II. CuNPs
   prepared by the method I showed higher FRAP and LPO activities, while
   increased POX activity was found in CuNPs prepared by method II. CuNPs
   prepared using method I also showed better anti-oxidant and antiplatelet
   potential. It was observed that M. oleifera-derived CuNPs exhibits
   strong anti-microbial, anti-oxidant and APTT potential. This indicates
   potential utilization of green synthesized NPs for various industrial
   and therapeutic strategies.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes a resilient, bandwidth scalable and energy efficient
   WDM-TDM passive optical network (PON) architecture that provides network
   access services to the end user at very high data rates and reduces the
   power consumption of access network significantly in the presence of low
   traffic/underutilized network. The proposed power saving technique
   includes the efficient use of proper line cards (LC) and adaptive link
   rate (ALR) mechanism at optical line terminal located at the central
   office. In the presence of low traffic, ALR switches link rate from 10
   to 1 Gbps depending on the particular threshold value of traffic load.
   In the presence of narrowband traffic, a significant amount of energy is
   saved. Proposed architecture also saves capital expenditure (CAPEX) at
   remote node and reduces significant CAPEX for larger networks. This
   architecture also provides network resiliency against LC/TRx or module
   failure and bandwidth scalability to support future generation PON
   architectures without any service interruption.},

Title = {Nutritional and medicinal applications of Moringa oleifera Lam.-Review
   of current status and future possibilities},

Abstract = {Moringa oleifera Lam. (vern. Drumstick) is a mineral rich, medicinally
   important tree species of family Moringaceae. It has a wide range of
   culinary applications and has bioremediation, nutritional and medicinal
   properties. Conventionally, seeds of the tree have been used as natural
   coagulants and flocculents in waste water treatment. Its leaves and bark
   act as biosorbent for remediation of heavy metals and dyes. The tree
   provides remedies for a range of diseases and disorders by dint of its
   unique combination of numerous phytochemicals. Gum exudates of the tree
   are of immense medicinal importance due to their applications in
   biodegradable drug delivery systems and in treatment of asthma,
   dysentery and intestinal cancer. The multidimensional utilities of M.
   oleifera may cause overexploitation of this tree, posing danger to the
   existing natural variability in the near future. Therefore, there is a
   need for conservation of the species for ethnobotanical,
   pharmacological, nutraceutical and biodiversity purposes. Development of
   tissue culture propagation methods will assist in preserving some of the
   germplasm of the species. In the present review, consolidated analysis
   of the role of biotechnology in conservation and genetic enhancement of
   nutritional, medicinal and commercial value of the tree has been placed
   in perspective, together with an up to date review on phytochemical
   analysis of the plant, and its utility has been discussed to invite the
   attention of the scientific community to further consider the study of
   this miracle tree species and its nutritional and pharmaceutical
   properties.},
