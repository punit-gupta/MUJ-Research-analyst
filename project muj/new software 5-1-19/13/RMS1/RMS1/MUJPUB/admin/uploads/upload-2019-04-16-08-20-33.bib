abstract={Second law effects on Williamson fluid flow over a stretching sheet with non-linear convection in the presence of porous media has been done. Variable viscosity, Chemical reaction and non-linear thermal radiation effects has also been analysed. An external inclined magnetic field has been applied and assumed that the effect of induced inclined magnetic field is negligible. By applied suitable similarity transformations, governing equations has been changed into ordinary differential equations, after this the reduced equations are solved numerically by Runge-Kutta fourth order method with shooting technique. The effects of the appropriate parameters on velocity, temperature, concentration and entropy are discussed graphically. © 2019 by American Scientific Publishers.},

abstract={Stevia rebaudiana (Bert.) Bertoni is cultivated for its sweet leaves as they contain steviol glycoside sweeteners such as stevioside and rebaudioside A. Two cultivars of S. rebaudiana, Shoutian-2 and Fengtian, were evaluated in a greenhouse for their tolerance to abiotic stresses. The seedlings were exposed to salinity, drought or waterlogging stresses for 4 weeks. The cultivars differed significantly in their biomass accumulation, tissue ion concentrations and steviol glycoside accumulation. The salt tolerant cv. Fengtian contained higher concentrations of K + which led to higher K + /Na + ratio in the leaves, as compared to the less salt tolerant cv. Shoutian-2. Reduced biomass accumulation in cv. Shoutian-2 coincided with increased Na + and Cl ˗ concentrations in the leaves. The waterlogging stress reduced growth of both cultivars, but the salinity stress increased rebaudioside A concentration in the tolerant cv. Fengtian, and the drought stress increased stevioside concentration in the cv. Shoutian-2. This study concludes that the two cultivars of S. rebaudiana differ in their tolerances to salinity and drought stresses. © 2019 South African Association of Botanists},

abstract={A clinically oriented Computer-Aided Diagnostic (CAD) system is of prime importance for the diagnosis of melanoma, since the deadly disease is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, the development of CAD tools is hampered by several issues, such as (i) smooth boundaries between the lesion and the surrounding skin, (ii) subtlety of features between the melanoma and non-melanoma skin lesions, and (iii) lack of reproducibility of CAD systems due to complexity. The proposed system aims to address the aforementioned issues. First, the lesion regions are localized by incorporating chroma based deformable models. Second, the lesion patterns are analyzed to detect various dermoscopic criteria. Further, a robust ensemble architecture is developed using dynamic classifier selection techniques to detect malignancy. Quantitative analysis is performed on two diverse datasets (ISBI and PH2) achieving an accuracy of 88% and 97%, sensitivity of 95% and 97% and specificity of 82% and 100% for ISBI and PH2 datasets respectively. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={A theoretical model is suggested to examine the consequences of ciliary activity on the propulsion of micropolar fluid through a two-dimensional channel. The inner walls of the channel are carpeted with cilia such that their coordinated beatings produce a metachronal wave. Long wavelength and low Reynolds number approximations are implemented to obtain the exact solutions of the governing differential equations. Special attention is given to investigate the pumping and the trapping characteristics of the micropolar fluid due to ciliary metachronism. The motivation of this study is to understand the mechanisms underlying the transport of human semen through ductuli efferentes.

For this analysis, transition diagram of all subsystems is drawn and respective Chapman–Kolmogorov differential equations are derived using Markov birth–death process. All failure and repair rates of each subsystem are exponentially distributed. Various measures of system effectiveness like mean time between failures, mean time to repair and dependability ratio for all the three subsystems are also computed. Sensitivity analysis of system reliability is also performed. The reliability and maintainability are estimated at various time instants. Analysis of all the subsystems shows that sulphited syrup is highly sensitive from reliability point of view.

abstract={Sterculia urens Roxb., has been vastly used in pharma, health care, food, cosmetics, waste management, paper-textile, composite fiber, and leather industries, for a long period of time. Gum exudate of this tree is of high market value, therefore, in the name of its exudate, plant is commonly known as ‘Karaya Gum’ tree. Polymers of karaya gum are ideal choice over synthetic ones because of its natural availability, cost effectiveness, non-hazardous nature, easy recovery, and physicochemical properties. Moreover, the tree is widely used in tribal populations for its indigenous remedies against various ailments like oligospermia, leucorrhoea, constipation, body swelling, throat infection, wound healing, etc. Biochemical analysis authenticates photophysical, photochemical as well as pharmacological uses, and validates ethnobotanical applications by tribal communities up to some extent. The main purpose of this review is to highlight the potential of Sterculia urens, based on its ethnobotanical uses, industrial potential and perspectives of conservation and sustainable management. A comprehensive survey of literature was done to further explore various growth constraints, conservation strategies, and wide industrial applications. Sterculia urens has embraced significant values in international trade market due to its exceptional properties. Also the presence of diverse bioactive compounds has made this plant of interest for scientific research. Owing to the wide range of commercial applications and lack of knowledge regarding the scientific gum tapping methods, the plant has been exploited extensively for its highly valued products, while the propagation in natural habitat has been declining over the past few years. Excessive consumption of karaya gum has resulted in critically low abundance and thus this plant is now considered as endangered plant species in some states of India. Keeping in view its endangered status, conservation, and mass scale production through biotechnological approaches are fruitful towards maintaining its biological abundance. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Searching secret key of classical ciphers in the keyspace is a challenging NP-complete problem that can be successfully solved using metaheuristic techniques. This article proposes two metaheuristic techniques: improved genetic algorithm (IGA) and a new discrete cuckoo search (CS) algorithm for solving a classical substitution cipher. The efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed techniques are compared to the existing tabu search (TS) and genetic algorithm (GA) techniques using three criteria: (a) average number of key elements correctly detected, (b) average number of keys examined before determining the required key, and (c) the mean performance time. As per the results obtained, the improved GA is comparatively better than the existing GA for criteria (a) and (c), while the proposed CS strategy is significantly better than rest of the algorithms (i.e., GA, IGA, and TS) for all three criteria. The obtained results indicate that the proposed CS technique can be an efficient and effective option for solving other similar NP-complete combinatorial problems also. Copyright © 2019, IGI Global.

The kinetic models are based on the global reaction mechanisms and have been extensively used for a wide range of biomass under various operating conditions. Major emphases have been on the network models as these models predict the structural changes during biomass pyrolysis. Key aspects of various network models include reaction schemes, structural characteristics and applications to CFD simulations. Recent advances in understanding reaction mechanisms using mechanistic models have been summarized. Importance of inherent inorganic species in biomass pyrolysis is also critically analysed. Future studies of biomass pyrolysis modelling should focus on developing multiscale models considering reactions of all biomass components (i.e., cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, inorganic species and extractives) and potential interactions. © 2019},

abstract={In this paper, a systematic investigation of electronic structure and optical properties of quaternary chalcopyrite semiconductors Cu 2 ZnGeS 4 and Cu 2 ZnGeSe 4 in stannite and kesterite structures using the full-potential linearized augmented plane wave method are presented. The electronic structures and related properties of the crystals are studied with density functional theory using modified Becke – Johnson (mBJ) potential. The computed bands and density of states are found to be in good agreement with the available experimental and theoretical results. Important optical properties such as, dielectric functions, absorption spectra, refractivity and reflectivity of the crystals have also been investigated using the mBJ exchange potential. The imaginary parts of dielectric tensor are analyzed in terms of interband transitions. The band gap energies of stannite CuZnGeS 4 (CuZnGeSe 4 ) and kesterite CuZnGeS 4 (CuZnGeSe 4 ) compounds are obtained as 1.23 (0.74) eV and 1.52 (1.08) eV, respectively.

abstract={The pseudorelativistic behaviour of carriers is found in the energy bands of certain class of two dimensional (2D) semi-conducting materials such as phosphorene. In this article, the nonlinear optical response of pseudorelativistic electrons in phosphorene under intense applied electromagnetic field is investigated. Using Floquet theory, we demonstrate the anisotropic behaviour of anomalous Rabi oscillations in phosphorene, which occurs far from the conventional resonance. The role of anisotropy on anomalous Rabi oscillations in phosphorene is also justified numerically. The Bloch-Siegert shift is observed under strong driving field that strongly depends on the anisotropy of the energy bands of phosphorene. A theoretical description of the pump-probe experiment is given to detect the anomalous Rabi oscillations in phosphorene. The differential transmission coefficient shows a sinusoidal behaviour as a function of pump pulse duration whose amplitude exhibits a power law decay, which is quite different from graphene (relativistic fermionic system). So the Floquet theory can be used to characterize the different fermionic systems. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

The Sep/FAEM(42%) composite PCM developed in stabilized form was characterized by SEM, FTIR and XRD analysis techniques. The DSC results exhibits that the produced form-stabilized composite PCM (FSt-CPCM) had proper melting temperature (22.86 °C) and relatively high latent heat capacity (76.16 J/g) for thermal regulation targets of building spaces. The FSt-CPCM showed outstanding chemical stability and TES reliability although it was exposed to 1000 melt/freeze cycles. In addition, cement plaster containing FSt-CPCM exhibited appreciated temperature control performance in laboratory scaled-test room compared to ordinary cement plaster.

abstract={Zn 1−x Co x O (x = 0.0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.07) nanoparticles were synthesized via sol-gel method. For structural parameters like lattice constants, bond length and particle size, XRD patterns have been analyzed. The particle sizes lie between 15.75 and 35.31 nm. The Williamson-Hall analysis has been performed for strain calculation. The UV–Visible spectra show high transparency in visible range with a dip in near UV region. The band gap calculation has been done using Tauc's plot method. The band gap values show a quartic variation with x. PL emission spectra exhibit NBE emission that too undergoes quartic variation with x. The correlation between both the quartic variations has been analyzed and it has been established that the B-M effect and sp-d exchange interaction both play their role alternately. M-H curves of the Co doped nanoparticles show room temperature ferromagnetism whereas the undoped one have the diamagnetic character. The electrical resistivity has been found to be high; in the range of 4.81 × 10 4 to 7.26 × 10 4 Ω-m. A increasing trend in resistivity is noticed with increasing the Co concentration in ZnO matrix. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Selection of material in engineering design process is a difficult and elusive task due to enormous number of dissimilar materials availability. For effective selection of materials, the designers have to take into account a number of definite qualitative and quantitative criteria. In the same context, this paper proposes a hybrid TOPSIS-PSI approach for effective material selection in marine applications. In this paper, the selection index value has been calculated by using logical combination of PSI and TOPSIS algorithm and these values have been ranked in ascending or descending order. The highest preference selection index value has been taken as the best alternative for the marine application. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid TOPSIS-PSI algorithm, two practical examples are considered and the result shows that the proposed procedure provides satisfactory results when compared with past literature. Furthermore, hybrid procedure is performed for selection of best wt.% combination among hybrid aluminum nanocomposites for marine applications based on its physical, mechanical and corrosive behavior. The result reveals that 9 wt.% and 6 wt.% reinforced hybrid aluminum nanocomposites have optimum combination of all physical, mechanical and corrosion properties, respectively according to hybrid TOPSIS-PSI approach. © 2019, Indian Academy of Sciences.},

abstract={Background: A microbial electrochemical cell was designed for lignin depolymerization. Alkali-extracted wheat straw lignin was used as catholyte in a microbial fuel cell and operated for six days. At the cathode, lignin was depolymerized by H 2 O 2 , produced during microbial fuel cell operation. Results: The power density reached its maximum over two to three days (0.58 µW cm −2 ), and declined thereafter. Fourier transform infrared analysis of the residual lignin indicated the cleavage of C–O–C (β-O-4) bonds without disturbing the phenolic ring structure and high-power liquid chromatography analysis confirmed the presence of vanillin in the depolymerized sample. Conclusion: The proposed strategy involves a self-sustainable microbial electrochemical process to convert complex lignin into low molecular weight value-added aromatic chemicals such as vanillin. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry},

abstract={The effects of elevated ozone (O 3 ) levels (80 ppb and 120 ppb) on photosynthetic efficiency and growth of canola plants were studied in open-top chambers. The chlorophyll a polyphasic fluorescence rise kinetics OJIP, stomatal conductance and Chlorophyll Content Index (CCI) were measured after 15 and 30 days of O 3 fumigation, as well as in control plants; biomass measurements were done only after 30 days with and without fumigation. Analysis of the OJIP kinetics by the JIP-test led to the calculation of several photosynthetic parameters and the total Performance Index (PI total ). The decline of PI total under the 80 ppb O 3 treatment was due to a lower density of reaction centres (RC/ABS), while the notable decline under the 120 ppb treatment was found to be due both to a further decline of RC/ABS and to a pronounced lowering of the efficiency with which an electron can move from the reduced intersystem electron acceptors to the PSI end acceptors (δ Ro ). Stomatal conductance was affected by both treatments. Biomass was found to be affected by O 3 fumigation (for 30 days), decreasing by 40% at 80 ppb and by more than 70% under 120 ppb. Our findings indicate that biomass decline is due both to the lowering of CCI and the lowering of photosynthetic efficiency parameters. They thus suggest that two simple, non-invasive and rapid methods, namely, the analysis of OJIP fluorescence transients and the measurement of CCI, can be used to screen the effect of elevated O 3 on biomass of canola plants. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

After fabrication, these bioengineered foam nano-composites were studied for microstructural, mechanical and thermal characterizations. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis indicated the presence of characteristic functionalities within biopolyol segments, which was influenced by reactant activity within the polyurethane (PU) foams. Scanning electron microscopy revealed the cellular morphology of the foam. Thermogravimetric analysis enabled the study of foam decomposition behavior for different sample compositions. Incorporation of NC into pristine foam was found to delay the onset degradation temperature. Flammability studies depicted significant enhancement of flame retardancy with incorporation of NC up to a certain loading level. Compression tests demonstrated that significant improvement of compressive strength properties of foams could be achieved by incorporating bentonite nanoclay, owing to nucleation effect of nanoclay and corresponding enhanced structural integrity. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstract={Selective lignin degrading white rot fungi viz. Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Phlebia brevispora, and Phlebia floridensis were selected to evaluate antioxidant potential and auxin (indole acetic acid) production in complex and synthetic medium. Antioxidant potential of these fungi was tested against different free radicals including 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), nitric oxide, ferrous ion, and ferric ion along with total phenolic content. All the fungal strains produce phenolics ranging from 5.2 to 16.7 mg/ml and demonstrated various free radical and metal ion scavenging activity. Growth medium significantly affected all the activities. Almost similar antioxidant activity (~ 72% DPPH scavenging activity) was demonstrated by all the fungi in yeast extract glucose medium; however, the activity was lower in Czapek dox’s medium (from 60 to 45%). Indole acetic acid production was maximum in P. brevispora (31 μg/ml), which was closely followed by P. chrysosporium and P. floridensis. The extracts did not show any mutagenic or cytotoxic effect. Thus, these white rot fungi highlight their significance as a new source for the prompt production of extracellular antioxidants and auxin. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={A large number of mechanism were anticipated for copper since 1988 in NaCl medium. The detail electrochemical behavior leading to the anodic dissolution of copper, however, still remains uncertain. Herein, an Imidazopyrimidine Dye, named, 4-amino-3-(phenyldiazenyl)benzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-2(1H)-one, (APIP) has been used as a copper corrosion inhibitor in 3.5 wt.% (by weight) NaCl solution. The present investigation provides a brief mechanistic overview of the electrochemical mechanism of copper in aerated NaCl solution, simulating a static marine environment, with and without addition of APIP inhibitor. Potentiodynamic polarization (PDP) results confirmed that the APIP can suppress copper corrosion effectively at low concentration in 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution with an inhibition efficiency of 92.79% due to adsorption, along with the prediction of electrochemical mechanism. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements showed that the corrosion inhibition of Cu proceeds via both diffusion and kinetic controlled processes. Adsorption of APIP on copper surface is well fit with the Langmuir isotherm model and mode of adsorption is proposed. Antimicrobial activity was also studied and the result obtained showed ‘‘eco-friendly’’ nature of APIP. Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM), Energy dispersion X-ray (EDX) and Attenuated Total Reflectance-Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) observations of the copper surfaces confirmed the existence of adsorption of APIP thus can be potentially used in industries in which seawater is implied are numerous such as cooling water systems, desalination plants, power plants, and oil production units. Results obtained from theoretical calculations including quantum chemical density functional theory (DFT) method and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations confirms the experimental findings and provide further insight into the mode of adsorption on the copper surface. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Temperature dependent relativistic mean-field (RMF) plus BCS approach has been used for the first time to investigate the anti-bubble effect of the temperature and deformation in the light, medium-heavy and superheavy nuclei. Influence of temperature is studied on density distribution, charge form-factor, single particle (s.p.) energies, occupancy, deformation and the depletion fraction (DF). At T=0, the quenching effect of deformation is predominant. DF is found usually less in oblate deformation than in prolate. DF decreases with increasing prolate deformation even though the 2s-orbit is empty which shows the role of deformation in central depletion apart from the unoccupancy in s-orbit as is usually believed. As T increases, the occupancy of s-orbit increases, shell structure melts, the deformation vanishes and the weakening of central depletion is solely due to the temperature. The bubble effect is eliminated at T≈3–5 MeV as indicated by DF and the charge form factor. The temperature effect is found less prominent in superheavy bubble nuclei where the role of shell effects is indicated. © 2018},

A single-ended primary inductance converter (SEPIC) topology is designed and driven in continuous conduction mode (CCM) with advance feedback system to maintain constant voltage at output. A proportional integral (PI) controller is also proposed to make the system stable, and stability analysis is discussed in detail with the help of transfer function derived from the state space model. Bode, Nyquist and Polar plots are clearly drawn using the MATLAB tool to claim the system stability. For justification of mathematical analysis, a simulation of the proposed LED driver is also performed in MATLAB-Simulink using sim-power toolbox. The simulation results show the improved value of power quality indices like power factor (PF), total harmonic distortion (THD) and crest factor (CF) with constant rating of 84V, 1.5A at output.

abstract={Background: The purpose of the research was to improve the polyp detection accuracy in CT Colonography (CTC) through effective colon segmentation, removal of tagged fecal matter through Electronic Cleansing (EC), and measuring the smaller polyps. Methods: An improved method of boundary-based semi-automatic colon segmentation with the knowledge of colon distension, an adaptive multistep method for the virtual cleansing of segmented colon based on the knowledge of Hounsfield Units, and an automated method of smaller polyp measurement using skeletonization technique have been implemented. Results: The techniques were evaluated on 40 CTC dataset. The segmentation method was able to delineate the colon wall accurately. The submerged colonic structures were preserved without soft tissue erosion, pseudo enhanced voxels were corrected, and the air-contrast layer was removed without losing the adjacent tissues. The smaller polyp of size less than < 10mm was detected correctly. The results were statistically validated qualitatively and quantitatively. Segmented colons were validated through volumetric overlap computation, and accuracy of 95.826±0.6854% was achieved. In polyp measurement, the paired t-test method was applied to compare the difference with ground truth and at α=5%, t=0.9937 and p=0.098 was achieved. The statistical values of TPR=90%, TNR=82.3% and accuracy=88.31% were achieved. Conclusion: An automated system of polyp measurement has been developed starting from colon segmentation to improve the existing CTC solutions. The analysis of domain-based approach of polyp has given good results. A prototype software, which can be used as a low-cost polyp diagnosis tool, has been developed. © 2019, Asian Pacific Organization for Cancer Prevention.},

abstract={The intrauterine fluid motion is responsible for embryo transport and its implantation at fundus. It is believed that myometrial contractions induced by peristaltic propulsion and pressure gradient typically regulate the intrauterine fluid movement. Several factors like changes in the mechanical behavior of uterus with age, hormonal variations, number of pregnancies, and mode of delivery (vaginal delivery versus cesarean), and any gestation may impair this mechanism. There are limited reports which indicate that the intrauterine fluid movement is possible to control with the help of external electric or magnetic fields. However, there are very few studies that investigate the intrauterine fluid motion in the presence of aforementioned external stimuli. This encouraged us to develop a computer model to study intrauterine fluid movement induced by peristalsis in the presence of electro-magnetohydrodynamics. Uterus geometry is idealized as a tapered micro-channel, whereas the Williamson fluid model is used to represent the intrauterine fluid. The Debye-Hückel linearization and perturbation method are employed to obtain the mathematical solution for fluid motion in the presence of any external field. The effect of the Debye-Hückel parameter, Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity, zeta potential and Hartmann number on pumping characteristics, flow characteristics, shear stress and trapping are studied to analyze the sensitivity of the fluid model. Overall, this study presents a model to understand the behavior of the intrauterine fluid motion in the presence of electric and magnetic fields. The model and associated results may be encouraged and may helpful for biomedical engineers in the design and development of such biomicrofluidic devices which can transport the embryo at a suitable location of the uterus for implantation. © 2019, Società Italiana di Fisica and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The study of electroosmotic flow of biorheological fluids has been employed in the advancement of diversified biomicrofluidics systems. To explore more in this field, a mathematical model is developed to investigate the electroosmotic flow of pseudoplastic aqueous nanoliquids in microchannel. A tangent hyperbolic fluid model is employed to describe the rheological behavior of the pseudoplastic fluid. Here, analytical solutions for potential distribution, temperature and nanoparticle fraction are derived and perturbation solution for stream function, pressure gradient and volumetric flow rate are obtained. The convective boundary condition is applied on the channel walls. The authentic assumptions of Debye–Hückel linearization, long wavelength and small Reynold’s number are employed in the dimensional conservative equations. The influences of various emerging parameters are graphically computed for axial velocity, pressure gradient, thermal temperature, nanoparticle volume fraction, skin friction coefficient and Nusselt profiles. To observe the thermal radiation effects, a thermal radiative flux model is also deployed. It is noticed that the heat transfer Biot number increases with increasing thermal temperature; however, a reversed behavior is reported for the nanoparticle volume fraction. Therefore, the present model does not only provide a deep theoretical insight to interpret the electroosmotic flow systems, but it will also be applicable in designing the emerging tool for biomicrofluidic devices/systems under peristalsis mechanisms. © 2019, The Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering.},

abstract={Human malaria, one of the most striking, reemerging infectious diseases, is caused by several types of Plasmodium parasites. Whilst advances have been made in lowering the numbers of cases and deaths, it is clear that a strategy based solely on disease control year on year, without reducing transmission and ultimately eradicating the parasite, is unsustainable. Natural products have served as a template for the design and development of antimalarial drugs currently in the clinic or in the development phase. Artemisinin combine potent, rapid antimalarial activity with a wide therapeutic index and an absence of clinically important resistance. The alkylating ability of artemisinin and its semi-synthetic analogues toward heme related to their antimalarial efficacy are underlined. Although impressive results have already been achieved in malaria research, more systematization and concentration of efforts are required if real breakthroughs are to be made. This review will concisely cover the clinical, preclinical antimalarial and current updates in artemisinin based antimalarial drugs. Diverse classes of semi-synthetic analogs of artemisinin reported in the last decade have also been extensively studied. The experience gained in this respect is discussed. © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS},

abstract={Clustering is a useful technique to create different groups of objects on the basis of their nature. Objects of same group are of similar in nature and differ to the objects of other groups. Clustering has proved its importance in various fields such as information retrieval, bioinformatics, image processing and many others. In this paper, particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique is used with K-harmonic means (KHM) for clustering. PSO overcomes the limitations of KHM like local optimum problem. Fuzzy logic is also employed in this paper to make PSO adaptive in nature by controlling various parameters. The performance of the proposed approach is validated on five benchmark datasets in terms of inter-clustering distance, intra-clustering distance, F-measure and fitness value. The results of proposed approach are compared with well-known conventional clustering techniques such as K-means, KHM and fuzzy C-means along with different state-of-the-art clustering approaches. Two text-based benchmark datasets such as CACM and CISI are also used to test the performance of all clustering approaches. The proposed clustering approach gives better results in comparison with other clustering approaches as clear from both the experimental and statistical analyses. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Purpose: Global competition has intensified pressure on small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to implement lean. Recently, the debate has converged to the role of lean implementation barriers (LIBs). The purpose of this paper is to contribute to this debate by exploring the LIBs in SMEs through three case studies. Design/methodology/approach: A case study approach was employed followed by interpretive structural modelling (ISM) to model the interrelationship among the LIBs. Findings: This study reveals that lack of management commitment, leadership and resources are the key barriers to lean implementation in SMEs in India. Furthermore, poor communication between different levels of the organisation and inadequate dissemination of the knowledge of lean benefits also creates hindrance in lean implementation. Managerial implications of the identified barriers for lean implementation in SMEs have been discussed. Originality/value: The research regarding lean implementation in SMEs is scarce. This study is the first attempt of its kind to identify the lean barriers in a small industry setup through mathematical analysis. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The existence of bubble nuclei identified by the central depletion in nucleonic density is studied for the conventional magic N (Z) = 8, 20, 28, 40, 50, 82, 126 isotones (isotopes) and recently speculated magic N = 164, 184, 228 superheavy isotones. Many new bubble nuclei are predicted in all regions. Study of density profiles, form factor, single particle levels and depletion fraction (DF) across the periodic chart reveals that the central depletion is correlated to shell structure and occurs due to unoccupancy in s-orbit (2s, 3s, 4s) and inversion of (2s, 1d) and (3s, 1h) states in nuclei upto Z ≤ 82. Bubble effect in superheavy region is a signature of the interplay between the Coulomb and nn-interaction where the depletion fraction (DF) is found to increase with Z (Coulomb repulsion) and decrease with isospin. Our results are consistent with the available data. The occupancy in s-state in 34 Si increases with temperature which appears to quench the bubble effect. © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={Effective maintenance planning plays a significant role in increasing life and productivity of physical systems or equipment. For products such as automotive vehicles, the warranty planning is also a crucial decision for the automaker as they have to set aside the budget to deal with warranty claims. Both warranty decision and maintenance planning aspects depend on the reliability of the product. Higher reliability means fewer warranty claims and maintenance issues. This necessitates the more realistic reliability assessment of the product not only for design improvement but also for maintenance planning and warranty decisions. This paper provides degradation based reliability assessment considering component dependency and presenting a framework for maintenance planning. The critical role of the individual component in enabling system function is also included in this paper. Further, an improved preventive maintenance and warranty plan are suggested with the help of an automotive vehicle case study. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Magnetohydrodynamics plays important role to manipulate the physiological fluids due to magnetic nature of physiological fluids. Magnetohydrodynamics pumps are a robust technology which provide more elegant and sustainable performance compared with conventional medical pumps. To study the effects of suspension of the nanoparticles (drugs) in physiological fluids (blood) flow are important in biomedical science and engineering. Motivated by such applications, an analytical approach is presented to study the nanoparticle shape effects on peristaltic transport of nanofluids in presence of magnetohydrodynamics in the present article. A two dimensional continuity, momentum and energy equations are considered to govern the present biophysical model. The governing equations are also linearized using lubrication theory where we consider the low Reynolds number and long wavelength approximations. Closed form solutions are obtained for axial velocity, axial pressure gradient, temperature, pressure rise, wall shear stress and stream function. The effects of three different type of shapes (bricks, cylinders, and platelets) of nanoparticles on peristaltic pumping characteristics and thermal characteristics are computed with the help of graphical illustrations. The interesting outcomes of this study are relevant to more realistic designs for ocular peristaltic pumps in drug delivery systems. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={In recent time, latency plays a key role in the entire concept of augmented reality as well as in real-time applications. With the innovation in the theory of augmented reality and rapid advancement of real-time applications (robotics), there is a requirement to advance a system or a method to optimize the latency time in various challenging conditions. However, there is no standard method for optimizing glyph detection latency time through the Augmented Reality framework in the literature. Even though, currently some applications are using the marker (glyph) less AR system, there are challenges in the detection of object in real-time application and to overcome this complication, the glyph detection system is proposed. Here, we propose the machine glyph detection algorithm and mathematical formulation which calculate the optimized latency time through the rectifier and infra-red light in challenging conditions. The detection process and position of glyph have been processed by the ‘AForge.NET Framework’ and the POSIT algorithm. The experimentation outcomes calculate the performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of optimizing latency and accuracy. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

First, a modified non-homogeneous Poisson process model is developed in an imperfect debugging environment by assuming that new faults may be introduced in fault detection and correction process. Then, the detection rate and remaining faults of previous release are considered in the modeling and analysis of reliability of the current release. The optimal version-update time is computed using multi-attribute utility theory for these software systems, considering the two main utility factors, namely, rapid release strategy and level of reliability. The proposed models are verified on real data sets and are compared with other existing models.

abstract={Feeding system is an important unit in sugar manufacturing plants. It comprises with the help of six components, namely unloader, cane carrier, crushing unit, bagasse carrier unit, boiler and turbine. All these components are connected in series configuration and some components also have internal redundancy such as unloader is composed in 1-out-of-2: G and turbine 1-out-of-2: G with one standby structures. All these components generally show constant behaviour during repair and failure. So, here all failure and repair rates are considered as exponentially distributed. To fulfill the main objective of the present study, a mathematical model is developed for feeding system and C-K differential equations have been developed for fuzzy availability and profit analysis. In case of imperfect fault detection concept of coverage factor is also used. Numerical results also obtained for a particular case to highlight the importance of the study.

Global DFT based descriptors have been computed for ground state configurations and low-lying isomers of (CuS) n clusters. Computed HOMO-LUMO gaps, lying in the range of 1.25–3.53 eV, indicate that (CuS) n clusters may be utilized as renewable energy sources specially in photocatalysis and solar cell applications. A statistical correlation has been established between electronic and photo-catalytic properties of copper-sulfide clusters with their computational counterparts.

In this Internet age, online publicity plays a major role in the success of a movie, so we felt the need of including sentiment analysis of tweets related to movies in our study. We used a variety of data mining models to get predictions as accurate as possible. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Steganography is an application for concealed writing. Nowadays, development in the field of electronic media demands highly secure data transfer between computers over the globe. There is a pressing demand to send the secret information in the hidden form. Conceal writing is an ultimate feature of steganography which fulfills this demand. In general; a robust steganography scheme should have better visual imperceptibility of the hidden information with sufficient payload. In this paper, a steganography method based on cryptography is proposed. The proposed scheme uses two processes; first, encrypt the secret plaintext (PT) message followed by secret image generation from this encrypted message. Second, hide this secret image into the cover image using Daubechies discrete wavelet transform operation followed by mixing operation. After performing the Daubechies inverse discrete wavelet transform (IDWT) process, we get the stego image. Stego image visual quality is increased by using Daubechies wavelet. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is shown by experimental results. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Leakage has been the main issue in SRAM design due to the scaling of CMOS devices. In this paper, a novel technique has been proposed for 8T SRAM to reduce leakage current at 45-nm technology node. Here, we have used three different reverse body biasing techniques to reduce the leakage power. The three techniques used are: clamping of NMOS diode, clamping of PMOS diode, and clamping of NMOS and PMOS diode. Out of the three techniques, leakage current in 8T SRAM was minimum using PMOS clamping diode as compared to other proposed techniques. The supply voltage has been varied from 0.5 to 0.85 V. The leakage current has been reduced by both NMOS and PMOS clamping techniques, but the results for PMOS and NMOS were high as compared to two but lower than that of SRAM cell. The leakage current improved by 3.3x using PMOS technique and 2.7x using NMOS technique at supply voltage of 0.5V. The static power has also been calculated and compared for the three techniques. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={The hasty headway in the field of information technology has lead ways for an escalating crime rate being technically exhaustive. The crimes involving digital tools and devices assist to be the forensic evidences. An upsurge in digital evidences is coalesced with the growing size of storage devices. Pertaining to the ineffectualness of the traditional analysis methods to handle the colossal amount of digital data, the forensic investigators have to adopt big data analytics to store, recover, and analyze the digital evidence. The storage of digital evidence calls for surveillance and security, thereby preserving its evidential significance. The digital analysis and fraud detection make the recovery and storage of digital data achievable by effective data reduction and exploiting the features of data mining for storage and data archive. Advancement with the forensic analysis assures automated management of digital data thus safeguarding the sensitivity of data. The paper aims to take the facets of data reduction for efficient storage and retrieval of digital data, and an overall digital forensic research framework has been outlined. The proposed work supports the existing framework for data reduction and storage. It also outlines the challenges and the unaddressed aspects of digital forensics. In this paper, I also discussed the unaddressed aspects of forensic investigations and peaks into the loopholes and the opportunity realms that can lay groundwork for future. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.},

abstract={The various potential properties of nanomaterials make them prominent for most of the applications, used in our day-to-day life. Due to increase in the use of the nanomaterials, it is anticipated that the manufacturing and use of engineered nanoparticles (NP) will also grow rapidly. These engineered nanoparticles became toxic sometimes during the process of manufacturing as well as utilizing. Hence, there is a vital requirement for early recognition of toxic nature of these nanoparticles. Computational modelling is an effective approach for the same, which predicts toxicity on the basis of previous experimental data or molecular properties. QSAR is an emerging process to envision the toxicity based on their molecular structure properties. The various data mining techniques can accelerate this computation task and help in accurate and fast toxicity prediction. This paper leads the readers to work in this area, by providing a groundwork of the data, tools, and techniques used, along with future research directions. © 2019, The Author(s).},
