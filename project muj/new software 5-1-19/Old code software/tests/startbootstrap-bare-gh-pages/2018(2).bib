The Bloch-Siegert shift (BSS) is a shift in Rabi oscillation resonance condition, when the driving field is sufficiently strong. There are new type of oscillations exhibit in Weyl semimetal at far from resonance, known as anomalous Rabi oscillation. In this work, we study the phenomenon of the Bloch-Siegert shift in Weyl semimetal at far from resonance called anomalous Bloch-Siegert shift (ABSS) by purely quantum mechanical treatment and describe its anisotropic nature. A fully numerical solution of the Floquet-Bloch equations unequivocally establishes the presence of not only anomalous Rabi oscillations in these systems but also their massless character. © 2018 Author(s).},

DASC utilizes the principle of volumetric absorption i.e. solar energy absorbed by a thin film of working fluid flowing over the collector plate. The experimental study was carried out in four phases; in first phase flow rate was kept 2 lpm and volume fraction of nanofluid was changed from 0.001% to 0.007%, in second and third phase same procedure was followed for 2.5 lpm and 1.5 lpm flow rates respectively. In fourth phase the experiment was carried out with water for 1.5 lpm, 2 lpm and 2.5 lpm and the performance of collector was analyzed. Results obtained suggest that for water as a working fluid, thermal performance of the DASC at 2 lpm was better. Secondly, when nanofluid was used as a working fluid, thermal performance of the collector was found better for 0.005% volume concentration. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Bitcoin is a popular cryptocurrency that records all transactions in a distributed append-only public ledger called blockchain. The security of Bitcoin heavily relies on the incentive-compatible proof-of-work (PoW) based distributed consensus protocol, which is run by the network nodes called miners. In exchange for the incentive, the miners are expected to maintain the blockchain honestly. Since its launch in 2009, Bitcoin economy has grown at an enormous rate, and it is now worth about 150 billions of dollars. This exponential growth in the market value of bitcoins motivate adversaries to exploit weaknesses for profit, and researchers to discover new vulnerabilities in the system, propose countermeasures, and predict upcoming trends. In this paper, we present a systematic survey that covers the security and privacy aspects of Bitcoin. We start by giving an overview of the Bitcoin system and its major components along with their functionality and interactions within the system. We review the existing vulnerabilities in Bitcoin and its major underlying technologies such as blockchain and PoW-based consensus protocol. These vulnerabilities lead to the execution of various security threats to the standard functionality of Bitcoin. We then investigate the feasibility and robustness of the state-of-the-art security solutions. Additionally, we discuss the current anonymity considerations in Bitcoin and the privacy-related threats to Bitcoin users along with the analysis of the existing privacy-preserving solutions. Finally, we summarize the critical open challenges, and we suggest directions for future research towards provisioning stringent security and privacy solutions for Bitcoin. IEEE},

In the proposed scheme, graph wavelet transforms of both the cover image and transformed secret image (using Arnold cat map) are taken followed by alpha blending operation. The GSP-based inverse wavelet transform is performed on the resulting image, to get the stego image. Here, the use of GSP increases the inter-pixel correlation that results in better visual quality stego and extracted secret image as shown in simulation results.

abstract={Cyclic and low-magnitude loading is considered effective in arresting the bone loss as it promotes osteogenesis (i.e. new bone formation) at the sites of elevated normal strain magnitude. In silico models assumed normal strain as the stimulus to predict the sites of new bone formation. These models, however, may fail to fit the amount of newly formed bone. Loading parameters such as strain, frequency, and loading cycle decide the amount of new bone formation. The models did not incorporate this information. In fact, there is no unifying relationship to quantify the amount of new bone formation as a function of loading parameters. Therefore, the present work aims to establish an empirical relationship between loading parameters and a new bone formation parameter i.e. mineral apposition rate (MAR). A neural network model is used to serve the purpose. Loading parameters are supplied as input, whereas, MAR served as output. The model is trained and tested with experimental data. The model establishes an empirical relationship to estimate MAR as a function of loading parameters. The models predictions of MAR align with in vivo experimental results. The models response is analyzed which indicates that the bone adaptation characteristics are successfully captured in the relationship. The relationship established may be incorporated further to improve qualitative and quantitative prediction capabilities of computer models. These findings can be extended in future to design and develop effective biomechanical strategies such as prophylactic exercise to cure bone loss. © 2018},

abstract={A theoretical study is presented of peristaltic hydrodynamics of an aqueous electrolytic non-Newtonian Jeffrey bio-rheological fluid through an asymmetric microchannel under an applied axial electric field. An analytical approach is adopted to obtain the closed form solution for velocity, volumetric flow, pressure difference and stream function. The analysis is also restricted under the low Reynolds number assumption (Stokes flow) and lubrication theory approximations (large wavelength). Small ionic Peclét number and Debye–Hückel linearization (i.e. wall zeta potential ≤ 25 mV) are also considered to simplify the Nernst–Planck and Poisson–Boltzmann equations. Streamline plots are also presented for the different electro-osmotic parameter, varying magnitudes of the electric field (both aiding and opposing cases) and for different values of the ratio of relaxation to retardation time parameter. Comparisons are also included between the Newtonian and general non-Newtonian Jeffrey fluid cases. The results presented here may be of fundamental interest towards designing lab-on-a-chip devices for flow mixing, cell manipulation, micro-scale pumps etc. Trapping is shown to be more sensitive to an electric field (aiding, opposing and neutral) rather than the electro-osmotic parameter and viscoelastic relaxation to retardation ratio parameter. The results may also help towards the design of organ-on-a-chip like devices for better drug design. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.},

It was observed that PMMA host matrix is more affected by doping in comparison with PVA matrix, which shows bond modifications and crystallization with small doping. The band-edges are observed to shift, thereby lowering the band-gaps of the base polymers upon doping. While the changes are seen only below the absorption edge in PVA, PMMA exhibits alterations in both the band edge and overall transmission in the range of 300–900 nm. The results are interpreted in terms of the molecular level inclusion of Coumarin molecules in polymer hosts. © 2018},

abstract={In vivo studies suggest that cyclic and low-magnitude loading can be useful over pharmaceutical drugs in normalizing bone loss as it encourages osteogenesis (i.e. new bone formation) at the sites of elevated strain magnitude. In silico models assumed normal strain or strain energy density (SED) as the stimulus to predict loading-induced osteogenesis, however, these models may have limited success in fitting the in vivo new bone formation at several instances. For example, rest-inserted cyclic loading amplifies the new bone formation as compared to continuous-cyclic loading even though similar strain magnitude were induced in both the cases. It is also believed that loading-induced interstitial fluid flow can also be a potential stimulus of osteogenesis. The present study hypothesizes that fluid motion as osteogenic stimulus may explain the afore-mentioned anomalies. Accordingly, this work studies osteogenesis as functions of SED and canalicular fluid motion using an in silico model. Therefore, the new bone formation is considered roughly proportional to stimuli above their osteogenic thresholds. This model attempts to simulate in vivo new bone formation noticed in rest-inserted cantilever loading studies. The models prediction of site-specific new bone formation improves when fluid flow is considered as the stimulus. It is also noticed that fluid motion as the stimulus closely fits the new bone formation for another in vivo study where the effects of aging on osteogenesis were examined. These attempts to establish fluid flow as a potential osteogenic stimulus can be useful in the prediction of site-specific new bone formation. The findings will ultimately be useful in designing biomechanical interventions such as prophylactic exercises to cure bone loss. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={With several waste additives been used for increasing the flexural strength of concrete, this research aims at using human hair as an economic and environmental friendly waste material adding much to the sustainable development. Flexural strength of concrete is one of its key mechanical property. By virtue of its flexural strength, concrete beams and slabs are able to transfer the loads to the supports. The present concrete matrix gives only 10 to 12 percent of flexural strength as compared to its compressive strength. Human hair lasts for decades before finally decomposing and entering to Carbon and Nitrogen cycle. The waste human hair dumped in the streams chokes the streams and increases the environmental burden. In this experimental work, feasibility for enhancing the flexural strength of concrete with two-dimensional variation in human hair i.e., the length of hair fiber and its proportion in the concrete matrix, has been investigated. The concrete specimens tested at the age of 7 and 28 days, reveled an increase in the flexural strength as compared to the control mix. The results indicated the possibility of using human hairs as fibers in the concrete mix for sustainable construction practices. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={An analytical study for electroosmotic flow of Bingham plastic ionic liquids driven by peristaltic pumping through a microchannel is investigated. The Poisson-Boltzmann equation for electric potential distribution is implemented to accommodate the electrical double layer in the microchannel. Boundary layer flow model is simplified under the low Reynolds number and long wavelength approximations. The solution of the electrical potential is based on the Debye- Hückel approximation for a symmetric (Z: Z) electrolyte solution. Closed form solutions for axial velocity, pressure gradient, pressure rise along one wavelength and stream function are derived. To examine the influence of physical parameters like Bingham plug flow width, electroosmotic parameter and Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity on pumping characteristics, computational results are illustrated. With vanishing yield stress, the Newtonian case is retrieved. An increase in plug flow width is observed to decrease volumetric flow rate and has a varied influence on the pressure rise depending on whether the flow is in the free pumping or pumping region. The findings of this study may useful in designing the microfluidics peristaltic pumps which often required to minimize the circulating volume of fluid and also helping to integrate the micropumping structure into the microfluidics circuit. © 2018 Author(s).},

abstract={Treatment or prevention of osteoporotic bone loss is a challenge for clinicians. Recent research efforts have shown that dynamic and cyclic loading may effectively prevent or reverse bone resorption as loading enhances osteogenesis. Loading-induced canalicular fluid flow in bone is considered as a potential stimulus of new bone formation. It is believed that poroelastic material properties such as porosity and permeability typically decide fluid flow in canalicular spaces of bone. Accordingly, the authors hypothesized that changes in poroelastic material properties with age may affect the fluid flow, which in turn affects the new bone response against any external mechanical stimulation. This work attempts to relate the age-related changes in poroelastic material properties to fluid-flow distribution in lacuna-canalicular spaces of bone. The outcomes may be useful in the development of effective strategies to enhance the canalicular fluid flow, so that optimal exercises or sports activities can be designed to prevent or reverse the age-related bone loss. © 2018 Author(s).},

abstract={In this paper, we present an analytical study of pressure-driven flow of micropolar non-Newtonian physiological fluids through a channel comprising two parallel oscillating walls. The cilia are arranged at equal intervals and protrude normally from both walls of the infinitely long channel. A metachronal wave is generated due to natural beating of cilia and the direction of wave propagation is parallel to the direction of fluid flow. Appropriate expressions are presented for deformation via longitudinal and transverse velocity components induced by the ciliary beating phenomenon with cilia assumed to follow elliptic trajectories. The conservation equations for mass, longitudinal and transverse (linear) momentum and angular momentum are reduced in accordance with the long wavelength and creeping Stokesian flow approximations and then normalized with appropriate transformations. The resulting non-linear moving boundary value problem is solved analytically for constant micro-inertia density, subject to physically realistic boundary conditions. Closed-form expressions are derived for axial velocity, angular velocity, volumetric flow rate and pressure rise. The transport phenomena are shown to be dictated by several non-Newtonian parameters, including micropolar material parameter and Eringen coupling parameter, and also several geometric parameters, viz eccentricity parameter, wave number and cilia length. The influence of these parameters on streamline profiles (with a view to addressing trapping features via bolus formation and evolution), pressure gradient and other characteristics are evaluated graphically. Both axial and angular velocities are observed to be substantially modified with both micropolar rheological parameters and furthermore are significantly altered with increasing volumetric flow rate. Free pumping is also examined. An inverse relationship between pressure rise and flow rate is computed which is similar to that observed in Newtonian fluids. The study is relevant to hemodynamics in narrow capillaries and also bio-inspired micro-fluidic devices. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={We report the structural and magnetic properties of as deposited and annealed Au capped Fe (20 nm) thin films on Si substrate. The magnetic measurements carried out on as prepared sample show signature square hysteresis loop of Fe, which transforms into non-magnetic one in 500 °C annealed sample due to the formation of FeSi2 interface alloy at the expense of Fe atoms from the layer and Si atoms from the substrate. No intermixing between Fe and Au is seen. Corresponding X-ray reflectivity (XRR) measurements performed on as deposited sample shows clear Kiessig oscillations and can be fitted without considering intermixed layer between Fe and Si, while annealed sample shows interface mixing leading to an increase in thickness and density. The observed results are explained in terms of annealing induced changes at the Fe/Si interface which result in the formation of ß-FeSi2 phase. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Magnetohydrodynamics plays important role to manipulate the physiological fluids due to magnetic nature of physiological fluids. Magnetohydrodynamics pumps are a robust technology which provide more elegant and sustainable performance compared with conventional medical pumps. To study the effects of suspension of the nanoparticles (drugs) in physiological fluids (blood) flow are important in biomedical science and engineering. Motivated by such applications, an analytical approach is presented to study the nanoparticle shape effects on peristaltic transport of nanofluids in presence of magnetohydrodynamics in the present article. A two dimensional continuity, momentum and energy equations are considered to govern the present biophysical model. The governing equations are also linearized using lubrication theory where we consider the low Reynolds number and long wavelength approximations. Closed form solutions are obtained for axial velocity, axial pressure gradient, temperature, pressure rise, wall shear stress and stream function. The effects of three different type of shapes (bricks, cylinders, and platelets) of nanoparticles on peristaltic pumping characteristics and thermal characteristics are computed with the help of graphical illustrations. The interesting outcomes of this study are relevant to more realistic designs for ocular peristaltic pumps in drug delivery systems. © 2018 Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature},

Antioxidant potential of these fungi was tested against different free radicals including 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), nitric oxide, ferrous ion, and ferric ion along with total phenolic content. All the fungal strains produce phenolics ranging from 5.2 to 16.7 mg/ml and demonstrated various free radical and metal ion scavenging activity. Growth medium significantly affected all the activities. Almost similar antioxidant activity (~ 72% DPPH scavenging activity) was demonstrated by all the fungi in yeast extract glucose medium; however, the activity was lower in Czapek dox’s medium (from 60 to 45%). Indole acetic acid production was maximum in P. brevispora (31 μg/ml), which was closely followed by P. chrysosporium and P. floridensis. The extracts did not show any mutagenic or cytotoxic effect.

The MapReduce model authorizes for systematic and instant organizing of large scale data with a cluster of evaluate nodes. One of the primary affect in Hadoop is how to minimize the completion length (i.e., make span) of a set of MapReduce duty. For various applications like word count, grep, terasort and parallel K-Mediod Clustering Algorithm, it has been observed that as the number of node increases, execution time decreases. In this paper we verified Map Reduce applications and found as the amount of nodes increases the completion time decreases. © 2017 IEEE.},

A major challenge to realize nanoswimmer is on-board energy harnessing for locomotion of nanoswimmer in complex surrounding media. In this paper, a design of piezoelectric based energy harnessing systems is proposed and simulated using COMSOL. The design is inspired by amplified stressing on trunk of a tree due to movement of its branched out structure. Amplified stressing is harmful to tree but the concept on contrary is useful in current context and envisages amplified generation of electricity to actuate nanoswimmer. It has been observed through simulation results that amplification of stresses to the tune of 68.95% is achievable by simple primary branching. Corresponding increase in generated electric potential is around 60% which is quite significant and promising towards attempts to realize a nanoswimmer. © 2018 Author(s).},

abstract={One of the vital application of Emergency Ad hoc Networks is to establish communication between those affected by emergency situation and responders providing services. In most such cases, the conventional communication infrastructure such as wired and cellular networks get damaged and therefore cannot provide communication required to exchange emergency information. Therefore, to cope with such disasters in a fast and coordinated way, the optimal provisioning of the emergency information is crucial. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) are the paramount components for such situations. UAVs can act as mobile base stations and facilitate wireless communication to connect to nearest working telephone network access point. A large scale disaster information system can be formed by combining UAV network with existing available network regardless of some of network lines being damaged and destroyed. In this paper, we have designed a prototype of UAV assisted emergency ad hoc network (EANET). We have also evaluated and compared AODV and ZRP routing protocols by varying the number of UAV assisted EANET nodes in different transmission range cases of disaster scenarios. The experimental results illustrate that ZRP is the most appropriate protocol for emergency situations. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Software Defined Networking (SDN) is an emerging network paradigm which emphasizes the separation of the control plane from the data plane. This decoupling provides several advantages such as flexibility, programmability, and centralized control. However, SDN also introduces new vulnerabilities due to the required communication between data plane and control plane. Examples of threats that leverage such vulnerabilities are the control plane saturation and switch buffer overflow attacks. These attacks can be launched by flooding the TCP SYN packets from data plane (i.e., switches) to the control plane. This paper presents SAFETY, a novel solution for the early detection and mitigation of TCP SYN flooding. SAFETY harnesses the programming and wide visibility approach of SDN with entropy method to determine the randomness of the flow data. The entropy information includes destination IP and few attributes of TCP flags. To show the feasibility and effectiveness of SAFETY, we implement it as an extension module in Floodlight controller and evaluate it under different conditional scenarios. We run a thorough evaluation of our implementation through extensive emulation via Mininet. The experimental results show that when compared to the state-of-the-art, SAFETY brings a significant improvement (13 %) regarding processing delay experienced by a legitimate node. Other parameters such as CPU utilization at the controller and attack detection time are also examined and shows improvement in various scenarios. IEEE},

abstract={Over recent years, cognitive radio technology has been paid enormous attention as this innovatory communication archetype can utilize existing wireless spectrum resources more competently. Spectrum sensing is considered to be primary and most essential task for cognitive radio network operators. It has been acknowledged that cooperative spectrum sensing improves the overall sensing performance of the network. But selfish users be likely to act greedily to access the channel without involving in spectrum sensing. In this paper, we considered multiuser de-centralized cooperative spectrum sensing scenario and game theory is used to analyze the cognitive interaction process. A comprehensive expression is derived for throughput and it is, then, maximized through strategic interaction between cognitive users. Simulation result shows that taking part in sensing is not always good in terms of throughput. This work also evaluates network conditions to determine when to contribute in sensing to maximize throughput. © 2018 Elsevier GmbH},

abstract={Oilfields located in western India produce crude by injection of large amounts of water during secondary oil recovery. This water is obtained from underground aquifer and contains 5 mM sulfate approximately. Sulfate present in this water is converted in to sulfide by sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) present in the reservoir. Increased concentration of sulfide in the production fluid negatively impacts oil production and is known as reservoir souring. Most probable number and quantitative PCR enumerated 103-108 SRB ml−1 in various field installations. Isolates from produced water in sulfate containing medium showed similarity with Desulfotomaculum, Desulfomicrobium and Thermodesulfobacterium genera. Similarly, isolates from produced water in nitrate containing medium were related to Tepidiphilus, Paenibacillaceae, Kocuria and Thauera genera. In the present study four sand packed bioreactors simulating moderately high temperature oil reservoir were used for different souring control treatments. Results revealed that continuous injection of 4 mM nitrate or 1.5 mM benzalkonium chloride (BAC) was not able to control souring. However, co-injection of 2 mM nitrate and 0.75 mM BAC completely ceased sulfide production and controlled souring. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={A range of bio-nanocomposites were prepared by incorporation of organo modified montmorillonite nanoclay (OMMT) with or without use of aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)3) within polylactic acid (PLA) solution. Furthermore, the solution was employed for modification of ligno-cellulosic (jute) fabric structural reinforcements. The successful incorporation of nanofillers within the host polymer, polylactic acid (PLA) was confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Water uptake and swelling behaviour studies revealed that the water uptake and swelling ratio of bio-composites reduced significantly as compared to pristine jute fabric, whereas upon incorporation of OMMT and Al(OH)3, the water barrier properties reduced even further in the developed bio-nanocomposites. The flexural strength of the bio-nanocomposites also showed improved mechanical and dimensional stability. Synergistic effects of OMMT and Al(OH)3 were observed in enhancing the aforementioned physico-mechanical properties. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies revealed microstructural details of developed samples. Similarly, the thermo-gravimetric analysis and linear burning rate studies of Al(OH)3treated bio-nanocomposite materials revealed enhanced thermal resistance and reduced flammability respectively compared to both pristine woven jute fabric and fabrics treated with PLA alone or those without Al(OH)3. From the above results it can safely be said that the bio-nanocomposite material can be a prospective candidate for development of flame retardant biopackaging. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={A mathematical model is presented to analyze the unsteady peristaltic flow of magnetized viscoelastic fluids through a deformable curved channel. The study simulates the bio-inspired pumping of electroconductive rheological polymers which possess both electroconductive and viscoelastic properties. The Jeffrey viscoelastic model is utilized which features both relaxation and retardation terms of relevance to real polymers. A magnetic body force is incorporated for the influence of static radial magnetic field. The mass and momentum conservation equations are formulated in an intrinsic coordinate system and transformed with appropriate variables into a nondimensional system between the wave and the laboratory frames, under lubrication (i.e., low Reynolds number and long wavelength) approximations. Kinematic and no-slip boundary conditions are imposed at the channel walls. A magnetic body force is incorporated for the influence of static radial magnetic field in the primary momentum equation. An analytic approach is employed to determine closed-form solutions for stream function, axial pressure gradient, and volumetric flow rate. Spatiotemporal plots for pressure distribution along the channel (passage) length are presented to study the influences of curvature parameter, relaxation-to-retardation time ratio (Jeffrey first viscoelastic parameter) and Hartmann number (magnetic field parameter). The effects of these parameters on radial velocity distributions are also visualized. Cases of trapping and reflux in a curved channel are discussed. Streamline distributions are included to study trapping phenomena and to investigate more closely the impact of curvature, magnetic field, and viscoelastic properties on bolus evolution. The reflux or retrograde motion of the particles is studied by particle advection based on Lagrangian viewpoint. The simulations provide new insight into the mechanisms of pumping of electroconductive non-Newtonian liquids in realistic geometries. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.},

Nano uids is considered as water based single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) nano uids. A comparative study for SWCNT and MWCNT is also made. Governing equations are transformed into set of ordinary differential equations using similarity transformations.

Nu- merical and graphical results are presented to discuss the effects of various physical parameters on velocity profile, temperature profile, Nusselt number, Sherwood number and skin friction coeficient for different type of nanoparti- cles for suction and injection cases. Stream lines and isotherms are also plotted for three different cases viz. permeable sheet with suction, impermeable sheet and permeable sheet with injection. A comparative analysis with existing re- sults is tabulated which validate that the numerical results of present study have good correlation with existing results. The outcomes of the results show that skin friction coeficient is more for SWCNT in caparison of MWCNT and the boundary layer thickness is maximum for permeable stretching sheet with suction parameter.},

Owing to the relevance of nanofluid dynamics, we analyze the nanofluid flow in the presence of gyrotactic microorganism and magnetohydrodynamics through a stretching/shrinking plate. The impacts of chemical reaction and thermal radiation on flow characteristics are also studied. To simplify the governing equations of microorganisms, velocity, concentration and temperature, the similarity transformations are employed. The couple governing equations are numerically solved using Successive Taylor Series Linearization Method (STSLM). The velocity profile, motile microorganism density profile, concentration profile, temperature profile as well as Nusselt number, skin friction coefficient, Sherwood number and density number of motile microorganisms are discussed using tables and graphs against all the sundry parameters. A numerical comparison is also given for Nusselt number, Sherwood number, skin friction, and density number of motile microorganisms with previously published results to validate the present model.

abstract={Electrokinetic peristaltic multi-layered transport is considered in a micro-channel under the action of an axial electrical field. Three different layers i.e. the core layer, intermediate layer and peripheral layer are simulated with three different viscosities for each fluid layer. The unsteady two-dimensional conservation equations for mass and momentum with electrokinetic body forces, are transformed from the wave frame to the laboratory frame and the electrical field terms are rendered into electrical potential terms via the Poisson–Boltzmann equation, Debye length approximation and ionic Nernst–Planck equation. The dimensionless emerging linearized electrokinetic boundary value problem is solved using integral methods. Closed-form expressions are derived for stream functions in the core, intermediate and peripheral layers. Expressions are also derived for the core–intermediate interface shape and the intermediate–peripheral interface shape. Maximum pressures are also computed. To study bolus migration, the range of the trapping limit is also determined in the peripheral layer. It is found that in the core layer larger boluses are computed in the case of lower intermediate layer viscosity relative to peripheral layer viscosity although the number of boluses is greater when the intermediate layer viscosity exceeds the peripheral layer viscosity. Furthermore, in the intermediate layer, stronger concentration of streamlines is computed in the lower half space with positive Helmholtz–Smoluchowski velocity. Also negative Helmholtz–Smoluchowski velocity reduces the core layer (H1) interface shape whereas it enhances the peripheral layer (H) and intermediate layer (H2) shapes. At lower values of volume flow rate ratio, hydromechanical efficiency is maximum for positive Helmholtz–Smoluchowski velocity whether intermediate layer viscosity is less or greater than peripheral layer viscosity. Finally, greater with greater peristaltic wave amplitude and also for positive Helmholtz–Smoluchowski velocity there is an increase in time-averaged flow rate, whether intermediate layer viscosity is less or greater than peripheral layer viscosity. The analysis is relevant to electro-kinetic hemodynamics and bio-micro-fluidics. © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS},
