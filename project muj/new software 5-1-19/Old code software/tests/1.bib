abstract={This paper deals with unsteady oscillatory flow of viscous incompressible fluid with heat & mass transfer in a horizontal channel partially occupied by porous medium following the Darcy-Brinkman model. The inner territory of the channel consists of two regions and one of them is filled with porous material and second is clear fluid. At the porous medium fluid interface, interfacial coupling conditions for the fluid velocity, temperature and concentration were used to derive the analytical solution. Some standard values of Schmidt number like Hydrogen(0.22), Helium(0.30), Amonia(0.78) and Eckert number (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2) and Prandtl number for water(0.71) and Air(7.0) was considered in this paper. The effects of pertinent physical fluid parameter like porosity, viscosity ratio, density ratio etc. on velocity, temperature and concentration distribution are considered and demonstrated through graphs. Heavier diffusive species and high molecular diffusivity ratio decreases the fluid concentration throughout the region. Increasing values of Prandtl number upsurge the fluid temperature throughout the region. © 2017 ANAME Publication. All rights reserved.},

abstract={From the dawn of technical age, software projects have always been significantly difficult to estimate and manage well. Over costing, delays in schedule, and out front cancellations of these projects have been a common issue we are facing for over 50 years now. Poor quality of the software, when delivered, remains to be a highlighted issue. Although, several tools for management of software projects are available, when even used by experienced managers to estimate the complexity of software project raises the odds of unsuccessful completions. Project management tools have many subcategories. However, they can be classified into two major groups of tools: [1] For estimation and planning of software projects and [2] For reporting and tracking of costs and status of project while they are underway. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.},

abstract={Precision manufacturing of complicated geometries viz. micro-holes and micro-slits is a challenging task in the metal cutting industries, especially on difficult-to-machine materials viz. metal matrix composites and aerospace materials. WEDM is one of the most demanding machining technologies used currently for such productions using thin electrically conductive wires. In the present investigation, an efforts have been made to produce micro-slits finding applications in micro-diffraction gratings, micro electro mechanical system (MEMS) devices and defence components. An experimentallayout has been conducted using Taguchi s L-9 Orthogonal array, experimental runs were conducted to predict the response viz. Overcut ona Ni-based super alloy (Inconel-600). In the present research article results have been discussed using Taguchi s Methodology and micro-structural studies (SEM). An experimental result reveals that overcut increases with peak current and pulse ON -time and decreased with increase of pulse OFF time (75-100μs). © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Machinability of aerospace material, Inconel 625 through Wire cut electrical discharge machining has been performed and compared using Taguchi’s Orthogonal L18 (21*35). Normal diffused and cryogenic treated diffused wires are being used as a tool electrode to investigate the effects of machining parameters viz. tool electrode, peak current, pulse on time, pulse off time, wire feed and wire tension on the response MRR. The present study resulted that cryogenic treated tool electrode give better performance in comparison to normal wire electrode assisting in improving stock removal and less electrode wear. Pulse on time and peak current are observed as the most influenced parameter.
