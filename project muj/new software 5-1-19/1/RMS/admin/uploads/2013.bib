abstract={In this paper reliability measures of a two-unit cold standby system are evaluated considering the ideas of arrival time of the server, preventive maintenance of the system after a maximum operation time and replacement of the failed unit if its repair is not possible by the server in a pre-specific time (called maximum repair time). The failure time of the unit follows negative exponential distribution while the distribution of arrival time, preventive maintenance time, repair time and replacement time of the unit are taken as arbitrary with different probability density functions. The system has been analyzed stochastically in detail using semi-Markov process and regenerative point technique. The behavior of some important measures of system effectiveness has been observed graphically giving particular values to various parameters and costs. © 2013, UK Simulation Society.

abstract={Major industrial sectors like automotive, aerospace and others are increasingly using adhesively bonded high performance polymers in their structural parts. Unfortunately, the surface of polymers is chemically inert and, therefore, exhibits poor adhesion properties. It is established that for successful application of polymeric materials to form structural parts using adhesive bonding, they need to have certain surface properties like polarity/high surface energy. This review article discusses the effect of modifying polymer surfaces by different plasma techniques on the surface energy and surface roughness of the polymers which play an important role in improving adhesive bond strength.},

abstract={In this manuscript, a fast improved technique is proposed for handwritten Devanagari numerals recognition. Today's scenario demands along with the high recognition rate require a technique which is fast and computationally efficient. Existing technique Foreground sub-sampling (FS) is based on the horizontal and vertical projection computation at each granularity level to find the division points. Here we proposed a technique through which the computation of horizontal and vertical projection at each granularity level becomes fast and efficient by using vertical and horizontal integral image. If sample image is 90 by 90 sized by FS technique at granularity level 3, 62100 addition (+) operations are required to find 85 division points while in our proposed technique only 18000 addition (+) operations are enough to compute same features. So the computation time of foreground subsampling technique is reduced 3 times. Our database (handwritten Devanagari numerals) is given by ISI (Indian Statistical Institute), Kolkata. The size of training and testing data are 18783, 3763 respectively and 98.97 % recognition accuracy is achieved.},

abstract={Global production of textiles products has increased more than 72.5 million metric tonnes of which synthetic fibers form an important part [1]. In fact, the production of natural fibers surpasses by synthetic fibers with more than 55% of products in the textile industry [2]. Polyester is the most used synthetic fiber first commercially produced by the du Pont Company. Polyesters are made from chemical substances found mainly in petroleum and are manufactured in three basic forms-fibers, films and plastics of which polyester fibers used to make fabrics is the largest segment. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) (Fig. 1) is the most common polyester used for textile manufacturing. PET is synthesized from ethylene glycol with either terephthalic acid (Fig. 2) or its methyl ester in the presence of an antimony catalyst under high temperature and vacuum to achieve high molecular weights needed to form useful fibers. Production of polyester accounted of 30.3 million metric tonnes in 2008 representing about 72% of the entire man-made fiber [1]. The 2009 global aggregate polyethylene terephthalate output summed up 49.2 m tonnes, of which PET fiber accounted for about two-thirds, whereas PET for packages and films 34% [1]. In 2010, the world textile industry has experienced the most potent growth in 25 years. Manufacturing volumes of natural and manmade fibers rocketed upwards by 8.6%, or 6.4 million tonnes, at 80.8 million tonnes of polyester indus- polyester indus-industrial filament yarn jumped up by spectacular 37%. Viscose fibers produced a record-breaking growth of 17% [2]. PET fibers are expected to account for 50% of the world fibers production in 2012 [1]. © 2013 by Apple Academic Press, Inc.},

abstract={Visual cryptography (VC) is a useful technique that combines the notions of perfect ciphers and secret sharing in cryptography. VC takes a binary image (the secret) and divides it into two or more pieces known as shares. When the shares are printed on transparencies and then superimposed, the secret can be recovered. No computer participation is required. There are various measures on which performance of visual cryptography scheme depends, such as pixel expansion, contrast, security, accuracy, computational complexity, share generated is meaningful or meaningless, type of secret images (either binary or color) and number of secret images(either single or multiple) encrypted by the scheme. In this paper, we will summarize the developments of visual cryptography since its birth in 1994, introduce the main research topics in this area where researchers have been contributing and outline the application of these schemes. © Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2013.},

abstract={Recently, Roy et al., published the synthetic procedure of biologically active mesoionic heterocycles. They have observed a peculiar mechanistic feature that substituted mesoionic derivatives do not undergo cyclisation whereas the unsubstituted one readily participates into the cyclisation. It is also revealed from their experimental study that sulphur containing mesoionic heterocycles are less reactive as compared to the oxygen containing derivatives. In this report, we have evaluated theoretical DFT based local reactivity parameters like fukui functions, local softness and local philicity indices to validate the above mentioned experimental facts. We have also calculated the global reactivity parameters to explain the reactivity differences between the substituted and unsubstituted mesoionic derivatives. The nice correlation between the experimental and theoretical counterpart supports our venture. © 2013 by Apple Academic Press, Inc.},
