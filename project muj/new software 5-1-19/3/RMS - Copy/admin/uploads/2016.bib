abstract={Over the past few decades, load flow algorithms for radial distribution networks have been an area of interest for researches, which has led to improvement in the approach and results for the problem. Different procedures and algorithms have been followed in lieu of performance enhancement in terms of simplicity of implementation, execution time, and memory space requirements. The implementation of load flow algorithm using CUDA parallel programming architecture for a radial distribution network is discussed. The computations involved in serial algorithm for load current, branch impedances, etc., have been parallelized using CUDA programming model. The end result will be an improvement in execution time of the algorithm as compared to the running time of the algorithm over CPU. Finally, a comparison has been drawn between the serial and parallel approaches, where an improvement in execution time has been shown over the functions involved in computations. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2016.},

abstract={Due to diverse applications in the field of science and engineering, the clusters formed between Gold and Silicon are attractive building blocks for future nano-scale and optical devices. It has remarkable catalytic, electronic, optical and magnetic properties. A number of experimental as well as theoretical researchers are actively involved into this research domain. Theoretical approach is very popular in terms of Density Functional Theory (DFT) to compute the electronic structure of matter. Conceptual DFT based descriptors have been invoked to correlate the experimental properties of nano compounds and composites. In this report, we have studied AunSi (n=1-8) nano alloy clusters. Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) with basis set LanL2DZ have been used in this analysis. The experimental properties of the AunSi (n=1-8) nanoalloy clusters are correlated in terms of DFT based descriptors viz. HOMO-LUMO gap (eV), Electronegativity (χ), Global Hardness (η), Global Softness (S) and Electrophilicity Index (ω). The calculated HOMO-LUMO gap exhibits interesting odd-even oscillation behaviour, indicating that even numbered clusters possess higher stability in comparison with odd numbered clusters. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

This paper describes a novel concept of partition based approach for fingerprint identification which aims to improve error rates as well as processing time in matching fingerprints. We aim to split the identity image into well separated partitions in order to simplify the identification task. Our system will use the gray-scale information of the fingerprints. The system will select the primary fingerprint, perform feature extraction & feature matching to identify the image in the database by comparing the featured values of both the fingerprints. Our implementation mainly incorporates image pre-processing, image partitioning, image binarization, feature extraction and feature matching. It finally generates a score which tells whether two fingerprints match or not. © 2016 The Authors.},

Virtualization does the key role on resource (e.g., storage, network, and compute) management and utilized the resource by isolated virtual machines (VMs). A good VMs migration system has an impact on energy efficiency policy. Good resource administration policy monitors the on-demand load management, and also manages the allocation/relocation of the VMs. The key challenges are VMs isolation and migration in heterogeneous physical servers. Threshold mechanism is effective to manage the load among VMs. Previous research shows thrashing is a good option to manage load and migrate the load among VMs during failover and high load. Linear programming (LP), static and dynamic approaches are superior to manage the load through VMs migration. This research proposes threshold-based LP approach to manage load balance and focus on dynamic resource management, load balance goals, and load management challenges. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2016.},

abstract={Achieving expected level of Quality-of-experience (QoE) at receiving end during real-time video streaming is a challenging task in inherently error-prone multihop mobile ad hoc network (MANET). Continuously fluctuating link conditions, dynamicity in bit rates of transmitted video and topology change due to node mobility are some major issues in providing required QoE to multimedia traffic in MANETs. In this paper, we propose a reactive Link Stability Based Routing (LSBR) protocol. LSBR discover route consisting of links having high lifetime. The stability of a link is estimated dynamically during the route dis covery process using its signal strength and interference along with the relative mobility of nodes forming the link. A multi-metric mathematical model has been developed using the aforementioned parameters to select a link from the candidate links at each intermediate node in such a way that leads to selection of high lifetime route. To prove effectiveness of LSBR protocol for real-life video streaming, a hybrid MANET scenario consisted of simulated nodes and physical machines is designed using an industry standard emulation tool called EXata-Cyber. Correctness of LSBR protocol for video streaming is established by simulation, hybrid testbed as well as users’ experience. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

abstract={Purpose: The research paper aims at studying the various factors affecting consumers online purchase attitude and the relative importance of these factors in determining consumers online purchase attitude. Additionally the study focusses on examining the effect of consumers online purchase attitude on their purchase intention. Design/Methodology/Approach: An empirical study was conducted where 100 individuals responded towards the questionnaire. The study examines that how an individuals perception differs from each other on the different factors affecting their purchase attitude which will determine their online purchase intention. Findings:The proposed framework explains the 64% of the total variance in purchase attitude affected by some identified factors in online shopping. Out of these major identified factors six factors were proven to have a significant effect on the purchase attitude i.e. risk of identity theft, risk of losing privacy, trustworthiness of the vendor, past purchase experience and time taken to deliver the products whereas the remaining three factors were proven to have no significant effect on the purchase attitude i.e. product return policy, time taken to access web page and information on FAQs and complaint resolution.Additionally As a result the literature support the positive relationship betweenattitude and online purchase intention. Research Limitations/Implications:The study was limited to the population of two cities of Rajasthan i.e. Ajmer and Jaipur taking small sample into consideration. Additionally the study could cover only 64% of variability in the online purchase intention due to the discussed factors. Practical Implications:The study contributes towards the development of the various ecommerce models and helps the various e-commerce companies as well as the online vendors to understand the different factors affecting online purchase intention due to differences in attitude which will increase their revenue and improve upon their strategies. Social implications: The study will benefit the society by providing the various critical factors affecting an individuals online purchase intention to be considered while shopping online and would create more awareness among them about purchasing over the internet. Originality/value:The study covers the population of Ajmer and Jaipur city of Rajasthan where no such studies have been done ever before.},

abstract={Background: Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) consist of sensor nodes which are able to sense a variety of physical phenomenon. It is a well-known fact that in most of the real world applications related to WSNs, the deployment is random as manual deployment is not possible due to harsh environments and other complexities. Therefore, there is no prior knowledge about the position of the sensor nodes that are deployed to form a wireless sensor network. In order to overcome this aspect related to position estimate of sensor nodes various localization schemes and algorithms have been proposed. The schemes and algorithms proposed so far also offer advantages like optimal routing, energy conservation, security, topology control besides providing the accurate position estimation of deployed sensor nodes. This paper explicitly presents a survey on the existing learning and non-learning based algorithms that have special role in localization of sensor nodes for WSNs. Methods: Comparative analysis of prominent learning and non-learning based algorithms. The analysis is based in terms of physical measurement, accuracy, computation and hardware cost and energy efficiency. Result: Detailed reporting of learning and non-learning based algorithms with their sub-categories. The study and survey of various algorithms throw light on their applicability and use for WSNs. Conclusion: Characteristics exhibited by the variants of the discussed algorithms are featured in order to make them application centric and cost effective. © 2016 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={Background: The fast emerging Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and its growing demand in each and every sphere of our lives has shifted our focus on the performance of the networks involved in varied fields. Recent studies depict that the performance of network and its utilization can be enhanced by QoS (Quality of Service) routing protocol. Thus, QoS is the essence of the WSNs. So, in this paper, we would like to present a detailed survey of the various routing protocols which play a vital role in attaining the QoS in WSNs. Methods: There are various levels of QoS which are required by the WSNs depending on the applications that they focus upon. The QoS support to WSNs can be achieved by various routing protocols. Thus, a detailed research on various routing protocols is done depicting their strengths and weakness and a comparison table of various protocols on various parameters is provided. Results: The QoS basically aims to focus on the quality that is perceived by the users of various applications. The QoS facilitates the above aim in terms of delay, packet delivery ratio, reduction in power of the sensor nodes, energy efficiency, bandwidth utilization, amount of through put generated and many other factors. However, there are few challenges faced by QoS which may occur due to dynamic topology and constrained resources. Even after these challenges the research suggests QoS is undisputedly the essence of WSNs. Conclusion: The QoS is very advantageous as it helps in improving the service provided to the users, and is accountable in improving the quality of output perceived by the users of various applications. Researchers have started working to overcome the challenges of QoS with the aim to minimize its constraints and maximize its multiple objectives. © 2016 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={Aadhar, as the name rightly suggests might be considered the base of an individuals identity in India. Going into the technicalities, Aadhar number can be rightly called a 12 digit Unique Identification Number. It serves as a proof of identity for the citizens of India. Aadhar has not only helped in better identification of Indians but it has also lead them to reap enormous benefits of various government grants as well as subsidies, including the LPG subsidies as well as the scholarships intended for the meritorious students. This number carries various positive implications with itself. At the same time it also suffers from certain shortcomings of the likes of security concerns. This paper aims to assess and analyse the financial aspect of Aadhar/UID. The area under purview here is that of seeding the Aadhar with bank accounts of individuals in India. An assessment has been undertaken of the extent to which individuals feel to be benefitted out of this linkage. The results depict that the people consider this linkage as an effective tool for better identification of an individual. The paper might rightly be called as reality check into the enormous e- governance initiative being undertaken in India. © 2016, Serials Publications. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The population of India has rapidly increased from 68.33 million to 121.01 million from 1981 to 2011, respectively. It is estimated that by the year 2028 India will hold the largest population of the world. The prompt upsurge of the Indian population will force people to migrate from the rural area to the mega cities, to avail basic amenities. The enormous migration will increase the demand for more space to live in mega cities and will lead to a situation of unauthorized, unplanned, uncoordinated, and uncontrolled growth, and this condition called as urban sprawl. The key challenge for a planner is to achieve sustainable development and to predict the future urban sprawl in the city. Unfortunately, conventional techniques that predict urban sprawl are expensive and time consuming. In this paper, we have proposed a novel technique to predict the future urban sprawl. We have used an integrated approach of Remote Sensing, GIS, and Multilayer perceptron to predict the future urban sprawl for the city Jaipur up to 2021. We have compared our results with existing techniques like Linear Regression and Gaussian Process and found that the Multilayer perceptron gives better results than other existing techniques. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

abstract={In the era of Liberalization, the banking sector has grown extremely but still money lenders in rural areas are continuously taking advantage of the poor section. Over the years there have been many schemes that had been taken up by the RBI and the government to take forward the financial inclusion process in India. Financial inclusion is a new concept which enables the alternative techniques to promote the banking habits and acts as enabler in reducing the poverty. The main objective of financial inclusion is to connect all individualwith banking system. This connection will lead to uplift their standard of living and overall development of the economy. The current government in the last year came up with extremelymotivated project, the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) in August 2015. The prime objective of the PMJDY is to ensure financial inclusion of the poor and rural population by giving them selfesteem, financial liberty and financial constancy. This scheme is a national mission on financial inclusion. It has the objective of covering all households in the country having a bank account and other banking facilities.This paper focusesthe evaluation of this scheme with reference to rural people of Bagru village of Jaipur City in Rajasthan. It also aims to highlight the present scenario of PMJDY in 2016 with the help of some true stories.},

Furthermost anomaly based IDSs employ supervised procedures, whose enactments extremely be contingent on attack-free training statistics. Nonetheless, this generous of training data is problematic to acquire in real-world network environment. Additionally, with fluctuating network setting or services, patterns of typical traffic will be reformed. This leads to high false-positive rate of supervised IDSs. Real-time detection is one of the most imperative issues in intrusion detection. When the network data is becoming enormous with high dimensionality, real-time detection with high detection accuracy and low false alarm rate is challenging for previous methods.

abstract={Objectives of the Study: The purpose of this paper is to examine the role of financial literacy in the realization of financial inclusion in India. If we analyze the financial inclusion, we will found that achieving the financial inclusion is based on two pillars - demand side and supply side. Where availability of the financial products in the market is very important, equally important is the fact that people are aware of them and they are in a situation to demand those products. In this context, financial literacy among the masses is very important, so that people have the awareness about the financial climate and financial products. This will increase their capability to demand for the financial products. This way, it can achieve the target of financial inclusion. Research Methodology: The research work is based on the secondary data. These data are obtained fromRBI publications, research papers and text books. It also uses secondary data from various other sources- newspapers, journals and periodicals like Economic Times, Business Line, Micro-Finance world etc. The study is designed as follows: In section-1 we introduce the concept of financial inclusion. An attempt is made to understand meaning, role and importance of financial inclusion. Section-2 will describe the link between financial inclusion and financial literacy and the various facets of it. In section-3 we provide our conclusions and some suggestions. Findings: Financial inclusion is an attempt to achieve the ultimate objective i.e. inclusive growth. Financial inclusion is an important constituent of this, because a financially deprivement is a very big deterrent of a persons overall development. Our study reveals that the final answer of financial inclusion rests on both sides-demand side and supply side. It is now, becoming increasingly apparent that addressing the problem of financial exclusion will require a holistic approach in creating awareness about not only on credit management but on financial products, education, debt counseling, savings and advice on money management. Significance of the Work: The research work addresses important aspects like financial awareness, education, debt counseling, etcwhich can contribute to attain our goal of financial inclusion.},

The proposed approach applies Breadth First Search to evaluate the nodes in the network and Kirchhoff’s current law (KCL) as well as Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL) for evaluating the current and voltages at each of the network nodes. The procedure is repeated till the convergence criterion is achieved. The paper demonstrates the working of Breadth First Search using CUDA. The efficiency of load flow algorithm has been enhanced by utilizing parallel computational power of Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). This approach has been tested for 33-nodes as well as for 69-nodes radial distribution systems and comparison has been done between the performances of sequential approach over CPU and parallel approach on GPU. The results show that introducing CUDA to load flow analysis speeds up the performance of the system by faster executions and gives accurate desired results as compared to sequential approach. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2016.},

Hence, to enhance the reliability and productivity, beneficial initiative must be taken. For this purpose, a reliability model of a redundant system having one original and one duplicate unit is developed with an immediate repair facility. Repairman conducts the preventive maintenance of the unit after a pre-specific time to enhance the performance and efficiency of the system. All random variables follow Weibull distribution. Mean time to system failure, availability and profit function has been derived for the considered non-identical redundant system. To highlight the importance of the study graphs are drawn for these measures.},

abstract={Load flow analysis of electrical distribution networks either for providing household electricity or in integrated circuits has always been a topic of great interest for researchers from last few decades. Various novel methods and techniques have been proposed for load flow calculations in the network and simulation tools are being used to determine the various characteristics of the network. The paper mainly focusses on these techniques at a single site and the enhancements made to the already existing techniques throughout the use of GPU architecture using CUDA platform in lieu of enhancing the performance of already existing solution with respect to time and algorithmic complexity. The paper also explains the need of enhancing prevailing solutions for load flow analysis for future generation smart grids or real time systems by comparing the performance with serial version for different topologies of network. Further the paper also throws light on some of the network reconfiguration techniques used to remodel the RDN due to high power losses in the network and floats an idea how parallel processing can be beneficial in enhancing already existing genetic algorithm based network reconfiguration technique to support real time load flow calculations and topology construction in smart grids and future generation systems. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Many automatic fingerprint identification approaches have been suggested. Amongst those various methods, the minutiae-based fingerprint demonstration and recognition is widely used. Minutiae based representation has some disadvantages in comparison to other fingerprint approached in terms of sample size. This paper describes a novel concept of partition based approach for fingerprint identification which aims to improve error rates as well as processing time in matching fingerprints. We aim to split the identity image into well separated partitions in order to simplify the identification task. Our system will use the gray-scale information of the fingerprints. The system will select the primary fingerprint, perform feature extraction & feature matching to identify the image in the database by comparing the featured values of both the fingerprints. Our implementation mainly incorporates image pre-processing, image partitioning, image binarization, feature extraction and feature matching. It finally generates a score which tells whether two fingerprints match or not. © 2016 The Authors.},

abstract={Education is one of the key aspects in the present century. Its almost fifteen years into the 21st Century, many universities around the world are trying new ways of teaching and learning and coping to find the new evaluation patterns in the classroom teaching. In the 21st century technology plays a significant role in changing the classroom environment. Many New Media Technologies were introduced by teachers to make the classroom more interactive and collaborative. This change has also been there for years in many universities around the world. Many universities in India are also a part of this pedagogy shift. Many universities are adapting new methods, processes and products to identify educational goals. The use of New Media Technologies, classrooms is becoming knowledge delivery centers and classrooms are expanding by themselves. Students can learn, interact and share the knowledge anywhere in the world. These technologies allow teachers to keep track on the student progress on time from anywhere. The technologies encourage peer to peer learning and collaborative research and also increase the teacher - student relationship. Teaching and learning through new media technologies helps to diversify the learners need and provide a teacher student collaborative learning environment. This research paper deals with the awareness of the different New Media Technologies used in the classroom teaching among students in Jaipur Region India. The main purpose of this research for the conduction of the experimental research among students in near future and to identify the effect of new media technologies on students performance.},

The antenna has achieved an impedance bandwidth of 133.3% (0.5-2.5 GHz) for a differential reflection coefficient less than -10 dB. The maximum broadside gain 7.5 dBi has been achieved. A unidirectional radiation pattern with stable gain has also been observed for the entire range of frequency operation. Symmetric radiation pattern for both E-plane and H-plane has also been confirmed owing to the symmetry of antenna structure and feed excitation. The cross-polarisation level lower than -30 dB has also been observed for better signal purity. Copyright © 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={Difficult geographies and high mobile penetration were seen as extremely potential for shifting focus from e-governance to m-governance in India. M-governance program m-Sewa was implemented in 2012. However, success of m-Sewa project depends on adoption and implementation by different State governments. A few Indian states have created comprehensive service delivery platform, integrated with their e-governance infrastructure. On the other hand, a few other states are just beginning the journey; while some other states are years behind. This paper attempts to make a comparative study of the m-government projects undertaken by different states of India as the mode to offer various government department services accessible to the citizens through mobile phones. The paper also attempts to evaluate the implementations as per elaboration likelihood model (ELM) framework. This paper will help the policy makers to decide the implementation strategy and kind of services to offer to maximise the adoption by users. Copyright © 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

For the Darcian model, the velocity and heat equations are analytically solved and the effects of various physical parameters on thses are discussed. In addition, the Entropy generation rate, Nusselt number and Bejan number are analyzed for different parameters. It was perceived that entropy generation number attains high values due to the thermal radiation. This is also concluded that rate of heat transfer upsurges due to the radiative heat tansfer and Brinkmann number.},

abstract={The screen adaptation of the novella Devdas by Saratchandra Chattopadhyay is an important landmark in early Indian cinema. A prominent film, screened in four Indian languages (Bengali, Hindi, Telugu and Tamil), it seems to offer a novel vision of romantic love and romanticism. This article critiques the fanciful interpretations of the film provided by some postmodern academics in the field of comparative literature. It endeavours to place the film both as text and cinematic work into a broader perspective based on the study of intertextuality of three renditions: Raghavaiahs Devdas (Telugu, 1953), Bimal Roys Devdas (Hindi, 1955) and Bhansalis Devdas (Hindi, 2002). Grounded in cultural theory and Indian performative aesthetics coupled with moving image analysis, this study highlights the underlying, deep-rooted romanticism embedded in Indian philosophical and aesthetic traditions of devotion between atma (individual soul) and paramatma (absolute soul), personifying Paro/Chandramukhi as atma and Devdas as paramatma. This article, part of a larger project on de-Westernising media studies, makes a critical intervention in current South Asian Studies by aiming to provide a novel theoretical framework to which the philosophical and traditional tenets grounding the novella of Devdas can be anchored. © 2016, SAGE Publications.

abstract={The world is a competitive arena where survival is dependent on sustainability. Environment has gradually changed and had influenced the sustainable development in the recent past. The changing era of technology has played a vital role in enhancing sustainable development through environmental ecosystem. This paper explores a niche area of environmentally sound technology (EST) to understand the holistic view of sustainable development through the microscope of society in India. This paper aims at exploring the barriers in adoption of EST in rural India and modelling the barriers in a revised unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model. It also projects revision in the model by adding moderating effect of prior experience, gender and age of end users to understand the change in behavioural intention of the user in rural areas. The results reflect difference in behavioural intention and degree of usage for different age groups and gender. The results derived from primary data collection showcase a classified result of barriers clearly justifying the moderating effect by each of the external factors.

The calli were brown due to phenolic substance secreted by the explant. This problem was overcome by using adjuvant PVP (0.1%). Further, secondary metabolites were isolated from callus and field leaf through soxhlet extractor and fractionated by using column chromatography. The antibacterial activity of these fractioned extracts from Tinosporacordifolia callus and leaf were seen against multi drug resistance bacteria viz., Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, (ATCC 27853) & Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213) and against plant pathogenic fungus Fuseriumoxisporum(MTCC 8608) and Sclerotiniasclerotiorum (MTCC 8785).

abstract={The main task for the software management is to predict the reliability of a software by using an appropriate software reliability growth model (SRGM). The accuracy of the mechanism adopted for reliability prediction is also an important factor. In this study, a software reliability growth modelling problem has been solved using artificial neural networks (ANNs), as ANNs based models are competitive with traditional statistical models for software testing effort estimation. In the first phase, a software reliability growth model has been proposed with compounded decreased error rate to predict the software reliability. The model is further extended by incorporating Cobb-Douglas production function to model the combined effect of time and resources used. Multi-layer feed-forward neural network is used to solve the problems. The weights associated with various input parameters are updated using generalised delta rule and Levenberg-Marquardt method. A comparison is then made with the results from existing models in the literature. The work is validated by using two famous real data sets. Numerical results show that the proposed models perform better in comparison to others existing in the literature. Copyright © 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={Image enhancement is a technique to improve the quality metrics of a distorted image. In forensic laboratory, if the input is noisy fingerprint image then image enhancement plays the crucial role to authenticate the verification stage. In this work, the author proposed to construct a filter based on Log-Gabor theory for enhancement of high noisy (Gaussian Noise) fingerprint image. To construct the filter, first initialize all filter parameters and to overcome the wrap around effect, first calculate the sine and cosine differences along with angular distance. When the filter is constructed, do the convolution with FFT of input noisy image. The resultant enhanced image attained PSNR and MAE (Mean Absolute Error) 7.9230, 101.728 dB, respectively. The comparison values of quality metrics for Mat lab inbuilt function (wiener and median filter) are 7.3291, 7.3281, and 101.977, 101.986 dB respectively for same test image. In this work, there is a little improvement in PSNR value which play significant role in verification stage. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2016.},

abstract={The development of financial inclusive sector in India has been promising with mobile technology playing a prominent role. The rate of growth of rural teledensity is phenomenal. Mobile banking (M-Banking) has therefore proved to be a win-win situation for both banks and telecom companies. On a parallel track, it is seen that acceptance and adoption of mobile as a channel has been an issue in rural areas. There seems to be dearth of analysis of factors resulting in the slow rate of growth. This paper attempts to dig out barriers and enablers of M-Banking in rural India and weave them using an interpretive structural modelling (ISM). The model results in connecting the dots and help the policy makers of banks and telecom companies analyse the issues faced at various levels. The results will add to the body of literature and simultaneously help practitioners to understand the various levels of implementation. Copyright © 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

The governing equations of fluid flow have been solved using regular perturbation technique. This is observed that the small values of the Peclet number increase the thermal conductivity of the fluid and therefore, the heat is able to diffuse away from the heated surface more rapidly. Moreover, an increase in the thermal radiation leads to props up the fluid temperature within the boundary layer. Further, the non-dimensional shearing stress and the rate of heat transfer in terms of the Nusselt number at the walls of channel are also obtained. © 2016 Institute of Thermomechanics CAS, v.v.i.},

abstract={The impact of ambient temperature rise and, therefore T-point temperature rise too, on the life time of LEDs is analysed in this paper. From the research conducted so far it is understood that life time resource of LEDs is mainly dependent on junction temperature. For most of the high power LEDs, which are enclosed inside a luminaire, dissipation of junction heat from the device is a major concern for most of the manufacturers. In this paper, an attempt has been made to investigate the underlying constraints of heat dissipation and subsequently using LEDs as a general light source. The investigation is carried out in two steps. Firstly, the degradation in light output with corresponding increase in ambient temperature is explored. Secondly, the impact of increase in T-point temperature on the lifetime of the LEDs is observed. The experiment is conducted using high power LEDs and the same is subjected to external thermal stress. The temperature inside the environmental chamber represents the ambient temperature for the LED and thus by gradually increasing the ambient temperature the T-point temperature is also increased. The temperature of the chamber and the T-point are measured by using k-type thermocouple. The corresponding data hence obtained are tabulated and correlated with light output. The results are analysed using statistical tool to obtain the relation between the parameters. © 2016, LLC Editorial of Journal “Light Technik”. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Gear system is one of the most important components in any mechanical power transmission system. A gear pair in action is generally subjected to contact loading at the mating surface. In this paper, the stresses due to contact loading have been evaluated on the surface of gear tooth and along the gear tooth depth. The spur gear was considered for this study for two different loading conditions, torques of 150 Nm and 200 Nm. The involute profile of the spur gear was generated using an ANSYS APDL program prior to spur gear model development. The finite element analysis was carried out using ANSYS 15. The Finite Element Method (FEM) was comparatively an easy and accurate technique for analysing the nonlinear gear contact stresses. Frictional coefficients ranging from 0.0 until 0.3 were selected and the corresponding contact stresses were found to be directly proportional to the friction coefficients. A governing equation for the relationship between the dimensionless contact stress values and gear tooth depth ratios for varying friction coefficients was established. The results showed that the maximum stress was located beneath the surface of the gear tooth in contact for low friction coefficient values, μ < 0.23. The stress trend remains the same for μ > 0.23 but the surface stress becomes greater than the stresses beneath the surface. Furthermore, the position of maximum stress along the depth of contact was unchanged regardless of the amount of torque applied and frictional coefficient values. ©2006-2016 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).},

In wireless communications, requirement of security and privacy of information is must. Therefore, transmission of sensor data over wireless communication channel plays a crucial role using cryptography techniques. The usage of cryptography characteristics of cellular automata are still not much explored in WSN. Hence in this paper, we present a symmetric key cryptography technique of block cipher using cellular automata (CAs) rules applied to sensor data in WSN. This cryptography technique uses non- complemented cellular automata rules and hybrid CA rule vector to form a group cellular automata that would be used to encrypt and decrypt sensor data.

In this paper, we propose using texture descriptors extracted from the nucleus image for detection of ALL. The disease causes change in the chromatin distribution of the nucleus, which can be observed in the form of texture. We have used two texture features, namely Local Binary pattern and Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix for automatic detection of ALL. A comparative analysis of both the features is presented. It is seen that LBP features perform better than GLCM features. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2016.},

This paper reports the behavior of field effective energy band alignment followed by the behavior of probability density of the charge carriers in the respective bands of type-I Al0.45Ga0.55As/GaAs0.84P0.16 symmetric nano-scale-heterostructures. In addition, the optical gain of the structure within TE (transverse electric) and TM (transverse magnetic) modes under constant electric field applied is also simulated and analyzed. In order to simulate the optical gain of the structure, 4 × 4 diagonal k→.P→ Hamiltonian matrix is solved for the purpose of getting envelope functions associated with carriers, carrier densities, dispersion curves of the quantum well structure, transition matrix elements and finally the optical gain. On behalf of simulated results achieved, it is reported that the optical gain in TM mode is found much greater than that in TE mode which is opposite to usual trends. Moreover, the application of external electric field along the growth direction shows that the optical gain within TM mode and the wavelength both can be controlled by controlling the electric field applied. Thus, the nano-heterostructure can be tuned externally by the application of external electric field within the NIR (near infra red) region. © 2016 Elsevier GmbH},

The synchrophasor measurements are used for real-time monitoring of the system. The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is used as classifier for predicting the transient instability status of the system with rotor angles and speeds (frequency) of generator as inputs at different consecutive cycle lengths after fault clearing. The stability status obtained from ANN can be utilized for initiating the emergency control actions within few cycles from fault clearing. The proposed scheme is able to successfully predict the transient stability status of the system for unseen operating conditions with varying topology. The proposed method is investigated on IEEE-39 New England system for its real-time applications and results obtained reflect the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. © 2015 IEEE.},

To accomplish this, the design parameter of the presented model has been optimized using an evolutionary algorithm. The equations relating to the system have been derived and the parameters influencing the overall electrical energy efficiency have been optimized, which is observed to be 20.81%. An improvement of 11.11% in the overall electrical energy efficiency has been observed in comparison with the model suggested by Agrwal and Tiwari [6].

abstract={The science of Geomicrobiology. , which deals with mineral- microbe interaction in nature contributes effectively to three important processes namely- mineral and metal bioremediation, biomining and soil mineral formation by microbes. Bioremediation one of the important process of the above, degrades or transforms hazardous contaminants to less toxic compounds. Several groups of fungi have proved highly efficient in this aspect, with asbestos being one such toxic entity in the environment on which their activity was studied. The present investigation uses the same tool as a device for detoxifying asbestos, a potent carcinogenic entity; with fungal isolates native to the asbestos mines of Rajasthan, India, being investigated for the first time. The cellular mechanism of asbestos toxicity is mainly attributed to the presence of iron in its chemical composition which catalyzes generation of free radicals leading to oxidation of biomolecules. The two dominant novel species found therein, identified as Aspergillus tubingenesis and Coemansia reversa have proved capable of actively removing iron from asbestos fibers as studied by scanning electron microscopy- electron diffraction X-ray (SEM-EDX) analysis. This probably could lead to a reduction in toxicity of asbestos, due to reduced iron concentration as reported in related studies. Many fungi are known to release iron chelating compounds, siderophores, which could be instrumental in the study. The findings related to two new fungal species being added to the list of earlier identified fungal bioremediators of asbestos, widens the prospect of using bioremediation as an effective tool for asbestos detoxification. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Influence of ionization is studied on two stream instability (TSI) in an inhomogeneous plasma in the presence of obliquely applied magnetic field. In addition to the usual TSI, a new type of instability is found to occur in this system, which is driven by the magnetic field and survives for relatively longer wavelength of oscillations. The growth rates of both the instabilities are enhanced by the magnetic field but their magnitudes attain a minimum value at certain angles of the wave propagation depending upon the wavelength of oscillations. At a critical value of ionization rate there is a sudden fall in the growth of both the instabilities, the reason of which is understood as the Landau damping. A further enhancement in the ionization suppresses the usual TSI whereas the magnetic field-driven instability attains much lower growth. This new type of instability grows faster in the plasma having heavier ions, but shows a weak dependence on the charge of the ions. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.},

The work done in this paper provides information about the filament current crest factor with corresponding change in electrode temperature. The lamps used for these experiment are switched on and off with sufficient time given to cool the lamp electrodes. The degradation of the lamp life with respect to filament current crest factor and electrode temperature are plotted and analysed. The best fit is obtained for the set of experiments conducted. From the set of results obtained a mathematical equation is derived.

abstract={The present study describes surface modification of leather using environment friendly atmospheric pressure dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) process to improve dyeing with natural dyes. Leather samples were exposed to dielectric barrier discharge produced in air. DBD plasma treatment changes morphology and chemical composition of the surface of leather samples. The chemical changes at leather surface are confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. The morphology and chemical composition of leather surface is studied using scanning electron microscope and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. We observed significant improvement in dye uptake properties after air plasma treatment. Different species formed in plasma are identified using optical emission spectroscopy. Untreated and plasma treated samples were dyed with Eco-Garnet Brown, Eco-Hill Brown III, Eco-Turkey Red and Eco-Smoke Grey natural dyes. Dyeing behavior was assessed by spectroscopic measurement and by measuring fastness (wash and rub) properties. This has clearly indicated an increase in color intensity of plasma exposed leather as well as an increase in the dye uptake as compared to the untreated leather. Best results were obtained with Eco-Hill Brown III and Eco-Smoke Grey dyes. The study reveals that atmospheric pressure plasma has potential to become dry and eco-friendly process to modify leather surface to improve dye uptake properties with natural dyes. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

This antenna is designed on glass epoxy FR4 substrate having size 30 mm × 20 mm × 1.59 mm. The coplanar waveguide fed circular patch antenna is modified by introducing L shaped slits in ground plane and U shaped slot in patch and performance analysis of antenna is simulated by applying CST microwave studio simulation software. Different designed antennas were tested with available experimental facilities. The developed end product shows a nice matching with feed network at frequencies 2.62 GHz, 3.94 GHz and 8.50 GHz and provides 10.38 GHz (3.33 GHz - 13.71 GHz) impedance bandwidth with wireless local area network 5.5 GHz (4.74 GHz - 6.15 GHz) band rejection. The co and cross polar patterns in elevation and azimuth planes at two frequencies namely 2.62 GHz and 3.94 GHz are obtained which dictate that co-polar patterns are significantly better than cross polar patterns.

abstract={This paper presents a simple and an efficient approach for load flow analysis of a radial distribution network by using parallel computation. By introducing CUDA (Computationally Unified Device Architecture), a platform is provided for performing the parallel implementation of the analysis.The analysis starts by determining the order of the nodes present in the distribution network. To generate the order of the nodes, Breadth First Search is used in parallel. Further, the current and the voltages present at each node of the network are evaluated. This procedure is repeated till the convergence criterion is achieved. CUDA provides an efficient utilization of the computational power of GPU, by which the performance and throughput of sequential load flow algorithm, has been enhanced dramatically. With the immense support of many GPUs, CUDA helps load flow analysis to efficiently manage and manipulate a large blocks of data of the distribution networks. Moreover there has been a lot of reduction in the execution steps as compared to the serial computing. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={Recent years have been advanced in cloud computing technology. Virtualization supports cloud computing to virtualize the resources to provide software-As-A-service, infrastructure-As-A-service and platform-As-A-service mainly. Many Virtual Machines are used in computing which gives flexibility, agility and scalability to the cloud resources that allow manipulating their Virtual Machines. Virtualized computing provides the virtual machines to client to access the resources at remote locations. Virtualization gives the features of resource utilization, isolation among hardware, operating system and software. Virtualization gives the features of multitenancy for simultaneously access of Virtual Machines, which machines are allocated in single physical machine.

abstract={In order to implement Sequential Bayesian estimator using Monte carlo simulation and to get rid of limitations of Kalman filter, Particle filtering techniques plays a very crucial role for target tracking applications in state space where Importance sampling approximately distributed by posterior distribution with multimodel feature and robustness to noise. However as the particles becomes very large, the Monte carlo representation becomes nearly equivalent to analytical description characterization for posterior distributions and has some deficiencies such as high computational cost and low sampling efficiency. Therefore, emerging computing platform, cuda may be regarded as most appealing platform for such implementaion. Representation provided with set of samples for target distribution of state leads to increase in sampling efficiency so that graphics processing unit (GPUPU) becomes more appealing to use in Particle filter. The modification on mapping architecture are evaluated with qualitative analysis. The proposed design will be 3.5 times faster than direct design. © 2015 IEEE.},

We propose a piecewise simulation based model for dynamic Vgnd estimation, which further needs capacitance models to be characterized at V gnd node. These capacitance models are used in conjunction with leakage current models to develop dynamic Vgnd model. Average error of less than 0.5% compared to 4.2% of previously reported models is achieved when compared to HSPICE results on ISCAS85 benchmark circuits.

abstract={The islanding issue in the distribution system poses great threat to the system during operation. With increased penetration levels of DG, the system is more vulnerable to islanding, leading to the collapse of the system. This paper proposes an improved method to detect the islanding in the system with DG penetration. The proposed work is a two-step method, firstly the siting and sizing of DG is obtained by two stage Genetic Algorithm (GA) to improve the voltage profile and to reduce the active power losses. A two stage GA ensures a faster convergence and better quality of solutions. Finally the proposed improved hybrid method is applied to detect the bus most susceptible for islanding under varying operating conditions. The improved hybrid islanding detection method utilizes the positive features of existing active and passive methods simultaneously. The proposed work is tested on IEEE 33 and 69 bus radial systems and the results obtained are promising. © 2015 IEEE.},

The morphological analysis of the sample was carried out by Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The observed size of ZnO nanoparticles by TEM micrograph exhibits the similar trend with the size calculated by Debye-Scherer formula.

abstract={Nanoalloy clusters formed between Au and Si are topics of great interest today from both scientific and technological point of view. Due to its remarkable catalytic, electronic, mechanical and magnetic properties Au-Si nanoalloy clusters have extensive applications in the field of microelectronics, catalysis, biomedicine, and jewelry industry. Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a new paradigm of quantum mechanics, which is very much popular to study the electronic properties of materials. Conceptual DFT based descriptors have been invoked to correlate the experimental properties of nanoalloy clusters. In this venture, we have systematically investigated AuSin (n=1-9) nanoalloy clusters in the theoretical frame of the B3LYP exchange correlation. The experimental properties of AuSin (n=1-9) nanoalloy clusters are correlated in terms of DFT based descriptors viz. HOMO-LUMO gap, Electronegativity (χ), Global Hardness (η), Global Softness (S) and Electrophilicity Index (ω).

abstract={We analyze the electrokinetic transport of aqueous electrolyte fluids with Newtonian model in presence of peristalsis through microchannel. Debye-Hï¿½ckel linearization is employed to simplify the problem. Low Reynolds number and large wavelength approximations are taken into account subjected to microfluidics applications. Electrical double layer (EDL) is considered very thin and electroosmotic slip velocity (i.e. Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity) at the wall is subjected to study the effect of applied electrical field. The solutions for axial velocity and pressure difference along the channel length are obtained analytically and the effects of adding and opposing the flow by applied electric field have been discussed. It is revealed that the axial velocity and pressure gradient enhances with adding electric field and an opposite behavior is found in the flow direction on opposing the electric field. These results may also help towards designing organ-on-a-chip like devices for better drug design. ï¿½ 2016 Author(s).},

When the band structures of the designed configurations, reported in this paper are compared, it is observed that when the value of (n-m) vector is divisible by three, the CNTs behave as metals, otherwise they behave as semiconductors. The density of states of carbon nanotubes depicts the energy gap around the Fermi level. For the tube with chiral chirality, density of states is zero near the Fermi level, for semiconductor behaviour there is small gap in density of states near Fermi level and gap increases as the behaviour changes to insulator. © 2016 Author(s).},

abstract={Discovery of porous silicon formation in silicon substrate in 1956 while electro-polishing crystalline Si in hydrofluoric acid (HF), has triggered large scale investigations of porous silicon formation and their changes in physical and chemical properties with thermal and chemical treatment. A nitrogen sorption study is used to investigate the effect of thermal annealing on electrochemically etched mesoporous silicon (PS). The PS was thermally annealed from 200ï¿½C to 800ï¿½C for 1 hr in the presence of air. It was shown that the pore diameter and porosity of PS vary with annealing temperature. The experimentally obtained adsorption / desorption isotherms show hysteresis typical for capillary condensation in porous materials. A simulation study based on Saam and Cole model was performed and compared with experimentally observed sorption isotherms to study the physics behind of hysteresis formation. We discuss the shape of the hysteresis loops in the framework of the morphology of the layers. The different behavior of adsorption and desorption of nitrogen in PS with pore diameter was discussed in terms of concave menisci formation inside the pore space, which was shown to related with the induced pressure in varying the pore diameter from 7.2 nm to 3.4 nm. ï¿½ 2016 Author(s).},

abstract={Recent studies on the potential toxicity of High Aspect Ratio Nanoparticles (HARN) has yet once again reinforced the health hazard imposed by asbestos fibres ranging from nano to micro size. Asbestos a naturally occurring fibrous mineral declared a Group I definite carcinogen by IARC (International Agency for Research on Cancer), a unit of WHO in the year 1987, has been extensively used since World War II to the near past for various commercial products. According to the most recent World Health Organization (WHO) estimates, asbestos-related diseases, resulting from exposure at workplace claims more than 107000 lives every year worldwide. The various types of toxic effects induced by asbestos in humans include - i) inflammation and fibrogenesis of lung, ii) mesothelioma iii) asbestosis and iv) bronchogenic carcinoma. The stability of asbestos in natural environment and its biological aggressiveness is related to their fibrous structure and dimensions. The actual risk associated with the exposure to nanosized asbestos, which is still unknown and escapes most regulations worldwide, has been shown in various toxicity assessment studies conducted on various animal models.In an effort to reduce the size of asbestos and therby its toxicity by limiting its biopersistence, oxalic acid treatment of asbestos coupled to power ultrasound treatment was carried out. The nanosized particles formed were still found to retain their hazardous effect. Similar were the results obtained on strong acid treatment of asbestos as well. A probable solution to the asbestos toxicity problem therefore envisaged was bioremediation. This involved the secretion of iron chelating molecules termed siderophores by microbes, which are of significance due to their ability to form very stable and soluble complexes with iron. Iron in asbestos composition is a major factor responsible for its carcinogenicity, removal or extraction of which would prove to be an effective answer to the worldwide problem. Siderophores are low molecular weight organic compounds with a very high and specific affinity to chelate iron and enhance their diffusion to the microbial cell surface. A number of successful experiments carried out in vitro have shown positive results concerning reduction in asbestos toxicity on chelation of iron by siderophores. The present investigation tends to put forth the aspect of these biomolecules secreted by specific bacteria and fungi as potent tools to fight the micro to nano sized asbestos fibre toxicity. © 2016 Author(s).},

Memristor has many advantages over conventional CMOS devices such as low leakage current at nanometer scale, easy to manufacture. In this work the switching characteristics of memristor is utilized. First the theoretical equations describing the switching behavior of memristor are investigated. To prove the switching capability of Memristor, a startup circuit based on memristor is proposed which uses series combination of Memristor and capacitor. Proposed circuit is compared with the previously reported MOSFET based startup circuits. Comparison of different circuits was done to validate the results. Simulation results show that memristor based circuit can attain on (I = 12.94 μA) to off state (I = 1.2 μA) in 25 ns while the MOSFET based startup circuits take on (I = 14.19 μA) to off state (I = 1.4 μA) in more than 90 ns. The benefit comes in terms of area because the number of components used in the circuit are lesser than the conventional startup circuits. © 2016 Author(s).},

abstract={The present trend of increasing the penetration levels of Distributed Generator (DG) in the distribution network has made the issue of Islanding crucial for the reliable operation of the network. The islanding, if not detected early may lead to the collapse of the system as it can drive the distribution system to the cascaded failure. In this paper, an extensive study of the effect of DG placement and sizing is performed by dividing the system into different zones to obtain a reduced effect of islanding. The siting and sizing of DG is carried out to improve the overall voltage profile or/and reduction in active power loss using two stage Genetic Algorithm (GA). In the first stage a basic knockout selection is considered and the best population is taken for next stage, where roulette selection for crossover and mutation is performed for optimal placement and sizing of DGs. The effect of the islanding, due to load variations is reduced by optimal siting and sizing of DG. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is tested on the IEEE 33 and 69 radial bus systems and the results obtained are promising. © The Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers.},

abstract={We analyze the peristaltic motion of aqueous electrolytes altered by means of applied electric fields. Handling electrolytes in typical peristaltic channel material such as polyvinyl chloride and Teflon leads to the generation of a net surface charge on the channel walls, which attracts counter-ions and repels co-ions from the aqueous solution, thus leading to the formation of an electrical double layer-a region of net charges near the wall. We analyze the spatial distribution of pressure and wall shear stress for a continuous wave train and single pulse peristaltic wave in the presence of an electrical (electroosmotic) body force, which acts on the net charges in the electrical double layer. We then analyze the effect of the electroosmotic body force on the particle reflux as elucidated through the net displacement of neutrally buoyant particles in the flow as the peristaltic waves progress. The impact of combined electroosmosis and peristalsis on trapping of a fluid volume (e.g., bolus) inside the travelling wave is also discussed. The present analysis goes beyond the traditional analysis, which neglects the possibility of coupling the net pumping of fluids due to peristalsis and allows us to derive general expressions for the pressure drop and flow rate in order to set up a general framework for incorporating flow control and actuation by simultaneous peristalsis and application of electric fields to aqueous solutions. It is envisaged that the results presented here may act as a model for the design of lab-on-a-chip devices. ï¿½ 2016 Author(s).},

abstract={We present seasonal rock magnetic data for 48 surficial soil samples collected seasonally around a coal-fired thermal power plant on the southwest coast of India to demonstrate how fly ash from the power plant is transported both spatially and seasonally. Sampling was carried out during pre-monsoon (March), early-monsoon (June), monsoon (September) and post-monsoon (December) seasons. Low- and high-frequency magnetic susceptibility (χlf and χhf), frequency-dependent magnetic susceptibility (χfd), χfd %, isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM), “hard” IRM (HIRM), saturation IRM (SIRM) and inter-parametric ratios were determined for the samples. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used on limited number of samples. NOAA HYSPLIT MODEL backward trajectory analysis and principal component analysis were carried out on the data. Fly ash samples exhibit an average HIRM value (400.07 × 10−5 Am2 kg−1) that is comparable to that of soil samples. The pre- and post-monsoon samples show a consistent reduction in the concentration of magnetically “hard” minerals with increasing distance from the power plant. These data suggest that fly ash has indeed been transported from the power plant to the sampling locations. Hence, HIRM may perhaps be used as a proxy for tracking fly ash from coal-fired thermal power plants. Seasonal data show that the distribution of fly ash to the surrounding areas is minimum during monsoons. They also point to the dominance of SP magnetite in early-monsoon season, whereas magnetic depletion is documented in the monsoon season. This seasonal difference is attributable to both pedogenesis and anthropogenic activity i.e. operation of the thermal power plant. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract={Using titanium isopropoxide as the precursor, Titanium dioxide (TiO2) powder was synthesized via sol-gel method, a promising low temperature route for preparing nanosized metal oxide semiconductors with good homogeneity at low cost. The as-prepared nano powder was thermally treated in air at 550, 650, 750, 900 and 1100°C for 1hr after drying at room temperature and used for further characterization. X-ray diffraction measurements showed that the annealing treatment has a strong impact on the crystal phase of TiO2 samples. The crystallite size as calculated from Debye Scherer formula lies in the range 29-69?nm and is found to increase with increase in annealing temperature. Photoluminescence studies exhibit an improvement in the optical efficiency of the samples with post synthesis heat treatment. Annealing at temperature above 900°C results in a degradation of the structural and optical quality of the TiO2 nano powder samples. © 2016 Author(s).},

abstract={In the present scenario, there are growing concerns over the potential impacts of bioengineered nanoparticles in the health sector. However, our understanding of how bioengineered nanoparticles may affect organisms within natural ecosystems, lags far behind our rapidly increasing ability to engineer novel nanoparticles. To date, research on the biological impacts of bioengineered nanoparticles has primarily consisted of controlled lab studies of model organisms with single species in culture media. Here, we described a cost effective and environment friendly technique for green synthesis of silver nanoparticles. Silver nanoparticles were successfully synthesized from 1?mM AgNO3 via a green synthesis process using leaf extract as reducing as well as capping agent. Nanoparticles were characterized with the help of UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and TEM analysis which revealed the size of nanoparticles of 30-40?nm size. Further the nanoparticles synthesized by green route are found highly toxic against pathogenic bacteria and plant pathogenic fungi viz. Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas syringae and Sclerotiniasclerotiorum. The most important outcome of this work will be the development of value-Added products and protection of human health from pathogens viz., bacteria, virus, fungi etc. © 2016 Author(s).},

The use of synchrotron radiation based valence band photoemission spectroscopy technique has been demonstrated which provides the variation in bandgap values as a function of annealing on [Si/Ge]x10 multilayers structure. For this purpose, the required VB offsets are obtained by considering the corresponding VB maximum of as prepared sample as a reference. The bandgap values thus obtained show a gradually decreasing pattern with increasing temperature, which is discussed in terms of the effect of various factors such as: (i) quantum confinement effect normally observed in confined systems (ii) change in the annealing induced intermixing leading to the formation of SiGe alloy and (iii) roughness at the surface/interface. © 2016 Author(s).},

The absorption edge shows a double edge feature, where distinct bandgaps for PVA host and dopant Coumarin are obtained. However at a higher doping wt % of 1 and 2, the absorption is mainly dominated by Coumarin and single absorption edge is observed giving a bandgap equal to that of bulk Coumarin (3.3 eV).

The experiment is performed using a 5 Ci 241Am gamma-rays Compton spectrometer, allowing 59.54 keV gamma rays to get scattered by the polycrystalline sample and the corresponding theoretical profiles are obtained from linear combination of atomic orbital method within density functional theory framework. Anisotropy curves using three different directions [100], [110] and [111] are obtained for the compound and an ionic model is also proposed, which supports the transfer of 2.0 electrons from Zn to P atom. At last, equal-valence-electron-density profiles for Zn3P2 and Cd3P2 are presented, confirming more ionic characters in Zn3P2. © 2016, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.},

abstract={In this paper, a laboratory-based penning plasma discharge source is reported which has been developed in two anode configurations and is able to produce visible and VUV lights simultaneously. The developed source has simultaneous diagnostics facility using Langmuir probe and optical emission spectroscopy. The two anode configurations, namely, double ring and rectangular configurations, have been studied and compared for optimum use of the geometry for efficient light emissions and recording. The plasma is produced using helium gas and admixture of three noble gases including helium, neon, and argon. The source is capable to produce eight spectral lines for pure helium in the VUV range from 20 to 60 nm and total 24 spectral lines covering the wavelength range 20–106 nm for the admixture of gases. The large range of VUV lines is generated from gaseous admixture rather from the sputtered materials. The recorded spectrum shows that the plasma light radiations in both visible and VUV range are larger in double ring configuration than that of the rectangular configurations at the same discharge operating conditions. To clearly understand the difference, the imaging of the discharge using ICCD camera and particle-in-cell simulation using VORPAL have also been carried out. The effect of ion diffusion, metastable collision with the anode wall and the nonlinear effects are correlated to explain the results. © 2016, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

abstract={The interest in applying an external pressure on a nano-heterostructure is to attempt to extract more information about the electronic structure through distortion of the electronic structure. This paper reports the tunability of the optical gain under the high pressure effect in M-shaped type-II In0.70Ga0.30As/GaAs0.40Sb0.60 symmetric lasing nano-heterostructure designed for SWIR generation. In order to simulate the optical gain, the heterostructure has been modeled with the help of six band k.p method. The 6×6 diagonalized k.p Hamiltonian has been solved to evaluate the valence sub-bands (i.e. light and heavy hole energies); and then optical matrix elements and optical gain within TE (Transverse Electric) mode has been calculated. For the injected carrier density of 5×1012/cm2, the optimized optical gain within TE mode is as high as ∼9000/cm at the wavelength of ∼1.95 μm, thus providing a very important alternative material system for the generation of SWIR wavelength region. The application of very high pressure (2, 5 and 8 GPa) on the structure along [110] direction shows that the gain as well as lasing wavelength both approach to higher values. Thus, the structure can be tuned externally by the application of high pressure within the SWIR region. © 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The rapid increase in population of India forced people to migrate from rural areas and small towns to metropolitan cities for better employment, education, and, good lifestyle. Major cities of India were industrialized and required more work force in metropolitan cities, leading to uncoordinated and unplanned growth, often termed as urban sprawl. Urban sprawl destroyed the natural resources such as open green space, agricultural land, open water bodies and ground water. In this paper, an attempt has been made to monitor urban sprawl using Shannons Entropy model, Remote Sensing, and GIS for city Jaipur, India. The changed entropy value during the years 1972-2013 proves more dispersed growth in the city. The built-up area of Jaipur has increased from 40 km2 in 1972 to 400 km2 in 2013. Land use percentage of urban settlement is doubled as compared to the urban population of Jaipur during 1972-2013.

The PVA solutions were synthesized with 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 wt% of PVA in distilled water followed by doping with Rhodamine B in concentrations ranging from 0.05 wt% to 2 wt%. The absorption spectra show an observable shift in the band edge position towards higher wavelength with increase in PVA wt%. When the dopant molecules are added, the curves are drastically modified with the occurrence of new peaks arising at higher doping concentrations along with change in the bandgap. These effects are prominent for all the concentration of PVA solution. The RI does not change much for low doping wt%. but when dopant is added in higher concentrations, it increases slightly reaching a maximum of ∼1.35 at 2 wt%. It is observed that host polymer properties dominate at low doping while a combination of host polymer and dopant dye properties dominate at higher doping concentrations.

abstract={Increasing gap between demand and supply of energy has resulted in raised prices of conventional energy sources, and concern for clean environment has led to increase in use of renewable energy and focus on increased energy efficiency. In context of increased energy efficiency, energy storage and waste heat recovery play an important role as these systems improve overall efficiency of systems. In this study, a latent heat thermal energy storage system (LHTESS) for stationary C.I. engine exhaust heat was developed and integrated with engine. A shell and tube type heat exchanger having 346 mm diameter and 420 mm height with 45 numbers of tubes with 18 mm diameter was developed to store thermal energy, in which Erythritol (C4H10O4) was used as a phase change material. The engine performance and the thermal energy storage system performance parameters such as amount of heat stored, and charging efficiency were evaluated. Slight decrease in the engine performance was observed when latent heat thermal energy storage system was integrated to engine but amount of energy which could be recovered was significant. At a load of 4.4 kW the maximum charging efficiency, recovery efficiency and percentage energy saved was 69.53%, 38% and 11.33% respectively. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

Sophisticated correlations are employed for thermal conductivity of the nanoparticles. The nonlinear boundary value problem is normalized with appropriate variables and closed-form solutions are derived for stream function, pressure gradient and temperature profile. Analytical solutions are evaluated numerically with MATHEMATICA symbolic software. Validation of computations is performed for the nonlinear moving boundary value problem via a Chebyschev spectral collocation method (CSM). A detailed study is performed for the influence of various nanoparticle geometries (bricks, cylinders and platelets). With greater magnetic field, flow velocity is enhanced for platelet nanoparticles whereas it is depressed for brick particles. Temperature is dramatically modified with nanoparticle geometry and greater thermal conductivity is achieved with brick-shaped nanoparticles in the fluid, with implications for optimized medical device systems. © 2016 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={The human intestinal tract is a long, curved tube constituting the final section of the digestive system in which nutrients and water are mostly absorbed. Motivated by the dynamics of chyme in the intestine, a mathematical model is developed to simulate the associated transport phenomena via peristaltic transport. Rheology of chyme is modelled using the Nakamura-Sawada bi-viscosity non-Newtonian formulation. The intestinal tract is considered as a curved tube geometric model. Low Reynolds number (creeping hydrodynamics) and long wavelength approximations are taken into consideration. Analytical solutions of the moving boundary value problem are derived for velocity field, pressure gradient and pressure rise. Streamline flow visualization is achieved with Mathematica symbolic software. Peristaltic pumping phenomenon and trapping of the bolus are also examined. The influence of curvature parameter, apparent viscosity coefficient (rheological parameter) and volumetric flow rate on flow characteristics is described. Validation of analytical solutions is achieved with a MAPLE17 numerical quadrature algorithm. The work is relevant to improving understanding of gastric hydrodynamics and provides a benchmark for further computational fluid dynamic simulations. © Institution of Mechanical Engineers.},

abstract={We investigate the velocity slip and thermal slip effects on peristaltically driven thermal transport of nanofluids through the vertical parallel plates under the influence of transverse magnetic field. The wall surface is propagating with sinusoidal wave velocity c. The flow characteristics are governed by the mass, momentum and energy conservation principle. Low Reynolds number and large wavelength approximations are taken into consideration to simplify the non-linear terms. Analytical solutions for axial velocity, temperature field, pressure gradient and stream function are obtained under certain physical boundary conditions. Two types of nanoparticles, SiO2 and Ag, are considered for analysis with water as base fluid. This is the first article in the literature that discusses the SiO2 and Ag nanoparticles for a peristaltic flow with variable viscosity. The effects of physical parameters on velocity, temperature, pressure and trapping are discussed. A comparative study of SiO2 nanofluid, Ag nanofluid and pure water is also presented. This model is applicable in biomedical engineering to make thermal peristaltic pumps and other pumping devices like syringe pumps, etc. It is observed that pressure for pure water is maximum and pressure for Ag nanofluid is minimum. © 2016, Società Italiana di Fisica and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={In this paper, a mathematical study is conducted of steady incompressible flow of a temperature-dependent viscous nanofluid from a vertical stretching sheet under applied external magnetic field and gravitational body force effects. The Reynolds exponential viscosity model is deployed. Electrically-conducting nanofluids are considered which comprise a suspension of uniform dimension nanoparticles suspended in viscous base fluid. The nanofluid sheet is extended with a linear velocity in the axial direction. The Buonjiornio model is utilized which features Brownian motion and thermophoresis effects. The partial differential equations for mass, momentum, energy and species (nano-particle concentration) are formulated with magnetic body force term. Viscous and Joule dissipation effects are neglected. The emerging nonlinear, coupled, boundary value problem is solved numerically using the Runge–Kutta fourth order method along with a shooting technique. Graphical solutions for velocity, temperature, concentration field, skin friction and Nusselt number are presented. Furthermore stream function plots are also included. Validation with Nakamuras finite difference algorithm is included. Increasing nanofluid viscosity is observed to enhance temperatures and concentrations but to reduce velocity magnitudes. Nusselt number is enhanced with both thermal and species Grashof numbers whereas it is reduced with increasing thermophoresis parameter and Schmidt number. The model is applicable in nano-material manufacturing processes involving extruding sheets. ï¿½ 2016},

abstract={The present study investigates the role of temperature in the formation of multiwalled carbon nanotubes from carbon black using arc discharge technique. Carbon black has been used as precursor to synthesize carbon nanotubes in argon atmosphere. The arc current has been varied from 25 to 40 A in order to study the morphological changes in carbon black as it gets converted to multi walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs).We observed formation ofMWCNTsat an arc current of 25 A; however the recorded temperature data suggested correlation of sustained arc temperature with the nanotube formation rather than the magnitude of current in its absoluteness. Interesting to note is that reported current magnitude in published literature are very high (>40 A) for conversion of carbon black but the present investigation shows that it is possible to convert the carbon black toMWCNTseven at lower current values in case the arc temperature is stabilized and sustained for longer period. Detailed investigations suggested that a sustained stable critical temperature of 1400 °C-1600 °Cis essential for the growth of nanotubes and an unstable arc causing temperature fluctuation from critical temperature value yields very low or no MWCNTs. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Alterations in optical transitions and distortions in wave symmetry in nano-scale QW (quantum well) heterostructures are seen due to external uniaxial strain under different polarizations. This paper reports the anisotropy phenomena and optical gain improvement realized in In0.3Ga0.7As/GaAs0.4Sb0.6 type-II QW-heterostructure (well width = 20 Å) under uniaxial strain in the SWIR (short wave infra red) region. The detailed study of the band structure, wave functions associated with the charge carriers in the respective bands and optical gain under electromagnetic field perturbation is reported. The 6 × 6 diagonal k→·p→ Hamiltonian matrix is evaluated and Luttinger-Kohn model is used for the band structure calculation. Optical gain spectrum in the QW-heterostructure under uniaxial strain along [110] for different polarizations of light is calculated. For a charge carrier injection of 5 × 1012/cm2 the optical gain is ∼1600/cm under input z-polarization, ∼14500/cm under x-polarization and ∼15700/cm under y-polarization without external uniaxial strain applied. A significant improvement in optical gain is observed under uniaxial strain along [110] direction under different input polarizations. Keeping in views its utilization in optoelectronics due its very high optical gain in near-infra-red region in x- or y-polarization mode, such structure can be considered as a novel structure. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The influence of transverse magnetic field on time-dependent peristaltic transport of electrically-conducting fluids through a microchannel under an applied external electric field with induced electric field effect is considered, based on lubrication theory approximations. The electrohydrodynamic (EHD) problem is also simplified under the Debye linearization. Closed-form solutions for the linearized dimensionless boundary value problem are derived. With increasing Hartmann number, the formation of bolus in the regime (associated with trapping) is inhibited up to a critical value of magnetic field. Flow rate, axial velocity and local wall shear stress are strongly decreased with greater Hartmann number whereas pressure difference is enhanced with higher Hartmann number at low time values but reduced with greater elapse in time. With greater electro-osmotic parameter (i.e. smaller Debye length), maximum time-averaged flow rate is enhanced, whereas the axial velocity is reduced. An increase in electrical field parameter (i.e. maximum electro-osmotic velocity) causes an increase in maximum time-averaged flow rate. The simulations find applications in electromagnetic peristaltic micro-pumps in medical engineering and also “smart” fluid pumping systems in nuclear and aerospace industries. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Cryptography and complexity theory have gained a lot of importance because of zero-knowledge proofs. The motive behind zero-knowledge proofs are to provide an obfuscation to the verifier, so that the verifier will not understand the information sent by the prover. Zero-knowledge proofs are normally used to verify a provers theorem to a verifier, in such a way that the verifier will not be able to discover any supplementary evidence other than the proof given to him. An enigmatic conception was formalized, that lead to the formation zero-knowledge proof systems. In this paper, we have reviewed different zero-knowledge argument / proof techniques. We have also reviewed the proof system implications in the presence of malicious prover and malicious verifier. Examples related to zero-knowledge argument systems are also given. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Transition metal substituted Titanium oxide (TiO2) has drawn a great deal of attention due to its excellent properties like solar cell as an EHP generator, physical properties which makes it suitable for various thin film applications i.e., in photo catalysis, Solar cell and gas sensor. When irradiated with UV light, TiO2 nanosized powder shows strong Oxidizability and reducibility. Ti0.9Mn0.05Fe0.05O2 sample synthesis was carried out by Solgel wet chemical precipitation route at temperature 350 °C. The crystallinity and the structure of doped TiO2 is determined by X-ray diffraction using Cu–Kα radiations operated at 40 kV and 35 mA in the range of 20° to 80°. The pattern gets indexed in Tetragonal structure and confirms the single phase material with no impurity. The morphological analysis of the sample is carried out by Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements. TEM image shows the irregular shape of the nanoparticles and particle size lies in the range of 75–125 nm. In the FT-IR spectrum of Ti0.9Mn0.05Fe0.05O2, the peak at 715.44 cm−1 shows bending and stretching mode of vibration of Ti–O and peaks at 1399.91 cm−1 shows stretching vibration of Ti–O–Ti. © 2016 American Scientific Publishers.

abstract={Over the past few years, designing of progressive visual recovery technique has been studied by many researchers. Previous research on PVC were all carrying pixel-expansion problem. Young et al. (2013) suggested a new dimension of Progressive visual secret sharing with the feature of Block based encoding and recovery of an original secret. In the Young scheme (2013), a secret image is subdivided into n non-overlapped image sections. When L (2 ≤ L ≤ n) participants stack their shadow images, all the image sections associated with these L participants will be recovered. In this article, the scheme suggested for a block based progressive scheme is critically analyzed and we show that leakage of secret information is possible in the scheme during the encoding process of the shares. Further, we propose a new robust progressive algorithm based on the logistic chaotic map to overcome the said limitation. The irregular outputs of the logistic map are used to encode a secret digital image. To provide robustness during the encoding process of the share, noise has been introduced along with chaotic sequences. The performance of the algorithm in the scheme of Young is critically analyzed and compared with the new suggested scheme. The empirical results are presented to showcase the performance of our proposed scheme in terms of its effectiveness and feasibility. © 2016 Taru Publications.},

Metachronal wave is generated by the beating of cilia and mathematically modeled as elliptical wave propagation by Blake (1971). Methods, results and conclusions The problem is formulated in the form of nonlinear partial differential equations, which are simplified by using the dimensional analysis to avoid the complicacy of dimensional homogeneity. Lubrication theory is employed to linearize the governing equations and it is also physically appropriate for cilia movement. Analytical solutions for velocity, temperature and pressure gradient and stream function are obtained. The analytical results are numerically simulated by using the Mathematica Software and plotted the graphs for velocity profile, temperature profile, pressure gradient and stream lines for better discussion and visualization.

abstract={A theoretical investigation of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flow and heat transfer of electrically-conducting viscoplastic fluids through a channel is conducted. The robust Casson model is implemented to simulate viscoplastic behavior of fluids. The external magnetic field is oblique to the fluid flow direction. Viscous dissipation effects are included. The flow is controlled by the metachronal wave propagation generated by cilia beating on the inner walls of the channel. The mathematical formulation is based on deformation in longitudinal and transverse velocity components induced by the ciliary beating phenomenon with cilia assumed to follow elliptic trajectories. The model also features velocity and thermal slip boundary conditions. Closed-form solutions to the non-dimensional boundary value problem are obtained under physiological limitations of low Reynolds number and large wavelength. The influence of key hydrodynamic and thermo-physical parameters i.e. Hartmann (magnetic) number, Casson (viscoplastic) fluid parameter, thermal slip parameter and velocity slip parameter on flow characteristics are investigated. A comparative study is also made with Newtonian fluids (corresponding to massive values of plastic viscosity). Stream lines are plotted to visualize trapping phenomenon. The computations reveal that velocity increases with increasing the magnitude of Hartmann number near the channel walls whereas in the core flow region (center of the channel) significant deceleration is observed. Temperature is elevated with greater Casson parameter, Hartmann number, velocity slip, eccentricity parameter, thermal slip and also Brinkmann (dissipation) number. Furthermore greater Casson parameter is found to elevate the quantity and size of the trapped bolus. In the pumping region, the pressure rise is reduced with greater Hartmann number, velocity slip, and wave number whereas it is enhanced with greater cilia length. © 2016 IAA.},

This manuscript is considered the similar shape character problem in Devanagari script. An algorithm is proposed first to estimate the similar character pairs in Devanagari Script and 7 pairs are identified by investigating the confusion matrix. Similar shape characters have very minor difference in shape thats why at the time of recognition (classification) phase, classifier is being confused with another similar shape characters. This problem can be solved by estimate that minor difference called critical region in the similar shape characters and used critical region to extract the more features before classification phase. The critical region is estimated by Fisher discrimination function. A new kind of masking techniques used to extract the features from ISIDCHAR (standard Devanagari database) and 96.58 % recognition rate is obtained finally after getting the 81.94% improvement in similar character recognition. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Effort estimation techniques play a crucial role in planning of the development of web-based applications. Web-based software projects, considered in the present-day scenario are different from conventional object oriented projects, and hence the task of effort estimation is a complex one. It is observed that the literature do not provide a guidance to the analysts to use a particular model as being the most suitable one, for effort estimation of web-based applications. A number of models like IFPUG Function Point Model, NESMA, MARK-II, etc. are being considered for web effort estimation purpose. The efficiency of these models can be improved by employing certain intelligent techniques on them. Keeping in mind the end goal to enhance the efficiency of evaluating the effort required to develop web-based application, certain machine learning techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Boosting and Support Vector Regression Kernels are considered in this study for effort estimation of web-based applications using IFPUG Function Point approach. The ISBSG dataset, Release 12 has been considered in this study for obtaining the IFPUG Function Point data.

abstract={Multidrug resistance of the pathogenic microorganisms to the antimicrobial drugs has become a major impediment toward successful diagnosis and management of infectious diseases. Recent advancements in nanotechnology-based medicines have opened new horizons for combating multidrug resistance in microorganisms. In particular, the use of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) as a potent antibacterial agent has received much attention. The most critical physico-chemical parameters that affect the antimicrobial potential of AgNPs include size, shape, surface charge, concentration and colloidal state. AgNPs exhibits their antimicrobial potential through multifaceted mechanisms. AgNPs adhesion to microbial cells, penetration inside the cells, ROS and free radical generation, and modulation of microbial signal transduction pathways have been recognized as the most prominent modes of antimicrobial action. On the other side, AgNPs exposure to human cells induces cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, and inflammatory response in human cells in a cell-type dependent manner. This has raised concerns regarding use of AgNPs in therapeutics and drug delivery. We have summarized the emerging endeavors that address current challenges in relation to safe use of AgNPs in therapeutics and drug delivery platforms. Based on research done so far, we believe that AgNPs can be engineered so as to increase their efficacy, stability, specificity, biosafety and biocompatibility. In this regard, three perspectives research directions have been suggested that include (1) synthesizing AgNPs with controlled physico-chemical properties, (2) examining microbial development of resistance toward AgNPs, and (3) ascertaining the susceptibility of cytoxicity, genotoxicity, and inflammatory response to human cells upon AgNPs exposure. ï¿½ 2016 Dakal, Kumar, Majumdar and Yadav.},

abstract={This paper explores how technological advances can help in better diagnosis of cancer affected region of the brain. There has been exponential increase in brain tumor cases in recent pasts and there has been a gap in existing technology for root cause analysis. New reports indicate that various brain tumors can be treated through surgery and in exceptional cases with radiation. Image segmentation provides huge potential in diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors. Image segmentation helps to find volume and growth of tumor with usage of techniques such as human edge correction, outer edge coloring and inter active thresholds holdings. There is critical requirement to find out an automatic or semi automatic method for classification of brain tumor images, to eliminate human error and provide accurate results in MRI images. A new approach LSF HYBRID model has been developed for detention and classification of brain cancer. System dependant actions such mechanisms leverage To locate the block and classify the brain tumor, this LSF HYBRID method users system dependant actions. It also utilizes other mechanisms such as Image enhancement, segmentation and Equalization of histogram. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper aims to open a new vista of research in the direction of possible application of power electronics DC-DC converters in analog chaotic communication. Most of the work reported on analog chaotic communication is based on the pioneer work of Pecora and Caroll, with synchronization between transmitter and receiver. Receiver based on synchronization, also known as coherent receiver, has a disadvantage of parameter mismatch and is sensitive to noise. In the present work, firstly, a secure transmitter using chaotic DC-DC converters is proposed that encrypts information using chaotic switching map technique. In chaotic switching map technique, the message is encrypted by randomly switching from one chaotic converter to another. The bifurcation parameter of the randomly switched chaotic converter is modulated by the message. Secondly, an attempt has been made to design a robust non-coherent receiver that is adaptable to the switching chaotic transmitters, even in the presence of noise. Once the receiver identifies the chaotic converter, it can decode the message as per the decryption algorithm. With the proposed non-coherent receiver, the disadvantages of coherent receivers can be overcome. We have also devised a prototype smart meter, used in smart distribution grid for implementing the proposed communication technique. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

abstract={Differentiating organization through service quality and engaging customer for long-term profit motive is a strategic adaptation for the complex competitive retail platform in India. Such approach incorporates the value of trust to ensure desired customer retention. The procedure further intensifies when an organizational approach emphasize effective complaint handling system within its service protocol. Based on this established relationship, this study explores the viability of the framework in the presence of customer complain intention categories with Indian context. Data for this descriptive study are collected using a structured questionnaire from 450 respondents. Out of the three types of complainants (consumer complaint intention), voice complaint intention appeared as the strongest determinant of consumer trust and retention as compared to private and third party complaint intention. On providing complaint handling, the strength of the relationship improved to the greatest extent for private complaint intention while there was no effect of complaint handling for voice complaint intention. Results of the study highlight as to what extent complaint handling matters for different types of complainants (voice, private and third party). Such practices can help the retailers distinguish and accordingly handle various types of complainants. Effective complaint handling practices can make the complainants more trustworthy and loyal than before. © 2016, © 2016 Management Development Institute.},

abstract={Background: Eco-friendly synthesis of nanoparticles is viewed as an alternative to the chemical method and initiated the use of microorganisms for synthesis. The present study has been designed to utilize plant pathogenic fungi Sclerotinia sclerotiorum MTCC 8785 strain for synthesis and optimization of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) production as well as evaluation of antibacterial properties. The AgNPs were synthesized by reduction of aqueous silver nitrate (AgNO3) solution after incubation of 3–5 days at room temperature. The AgNPs were further characterized using UV–visible spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Reaction parameters including media, fungal biomass, AgNO3 concentration, pH and temperature were further optimized for rapid AgNPs production. The antibacterial efficacy of AgNPs was evaluated against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 by disc diffusion and growth kinetics assay at the concentration determined by the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Results: AgNPs synthesis was initially marked by the change in colour from pale white to brown and was confirmed by UV–Vis spectroscopy. Optimization studies showed that potato dextrose broth (PDB) media, 10 g of biomass, addition of 2 mM AgNO3, pH 11 and 80 °C temperature resulted in enhanced AgNPs synthesis through extracellular route. TEM data revealed spherical shape AgNPs with size in the range of 10 nm. Presence of proteins capped to AgNPs was confirmed by FTIR. AgNPs showed antibacterial activity against E. coli and S. aureus at 100 ppm concentration, corresponding MIC value. Conclusion: S. sclerotiorum MTCC 8785 mediated AgNPs was synthesized rapidly under optimized conditions, which showed antibacterial activity. © 2016, The Author(s).},

Both topologies utilize a SCR as a switch to instantly isolate the fault from source. No sensing and detection of fault is required. For second topology, mutual inductance is used for SCR commutation. Coupled inductors help to reduce size of inductors, cost and also eliminate the need of additional Z-Source breaker capacitor.
