abstract={In this manuscript, a fast improved technique is proposed for handwritten Devanagari numerals recognition. Todays scenario demands along with the high recognition rate require a technique which is fast and computationally efficient. Existing technique Foreground sub-sampling (FS) is based on the horizontal and vertical projection computation at each granularity level to find the division points. Here we proposed a technique through which the computation of horizontal and vertical projection at each granularity level becomes fast and efficient by using vertical and horizontal integral image. If sample image is 90 by 90 sized by FS technique at granularity level 3, 62100 addition (+) operations are required to find 85 division points while in our proposed technique only 18000 addition (+) operations are enough to compute same features. So the computation time of foreground subsampling technique is reduced 3 times. Our database (handwritten Devanagari numerals) is given by ISI (Indian Statistical Institute), Kolkata. The size of training and testing data are 18783, 3763 respectively and 98.97 % recognition accuracy is achieved.},

abstract={Major industrial sectors like automotive, aerospace and others are increasingly using adhesively bonded high performance polymers in their structural parts. Unfortunately, the surface of polymers is chemically inert and, therefore, exhibits poor adhesion properties. It is established that for successful application of polymeric materials to form structural parts using adhesive bonding, they need to have certain surface properties like polarity/high surface energy. This review article discusses the effect of modifying polymer surfaces by different plasma techniques on the surface energy and surface roughness of the polymers which play an important role in improving adhesive bond strength.},

abstract={Visual cryptography (VC) is a useful technique that combines the notions of perfect ciphers and secret sharing in cryptography. VC takes a binary image (the secret) and divides it into two or more pieces known as shares. When the shares are printed on transparencies and then superimposed, the secret can be recovered. No computer participation is required. There are various measures on which performance of visual cryptography scheme depends, such as pixel expansion, contrast, security, accuracy, computational complexity, share generated is meaningful or meaningless, type of secret images (either binary or color) and number of secret images(either single or multiple) encrypted by the scheme. In this paper, we will summarize the developments of visual cryptography since its birth in 1994, introduce the main research topics in this area where researchers have been contributing and outline the application of these schemes. © Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2013.},

abstract={Interaction-centric capabilities for engaging consumers are the basis of "co-creation capabilities" of a firm. These capabilities can be used as a strategic tool to develop competitive advantage for service firms under service-dominant logic. The authors develop a "co-creation continuum" for scaling of services, based on their relative extent of co-creation capability. The study establishes consumers knowledge about the service process or the application technology, flexibility within the service processes, level of people interaction involved, and degree of importance of the service, as the underlying factors determining co-creation capability of a service. Practicing managers can use this continuum to effectively develop consumer co-creation strategies, by gauging the existing capabilities of their firm and hence, focusing on key areas of improvement. This research also conceptualizes a "co-creation willingness matrix," which is helpful in classification of services based on the firm-consumer willingness to co-create. This classification is useful for the firms lying on the disadvantageous end of the co-creation continuum, to reap the benefits of high level of consumer value co-creation by displaying higher willingness to co-create and by generating consumers willingness to co-create by adopting suitable strategies. This article also sets out agenda for future research. © 2014 Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Various automation systems like IBS, IPMS, CCTV, APMS and communication systems could be on the same physical network (reducing the cabling) and logically separated leading to isolation of network traffic to specified systems and smooth running of the automation systems without additional load in it, further as VLAN segment the network into different broadcast domains so the packets are only delivered between ports that are combined for the same VLAN. The latency is of key importance, to boost this up, further rapid spanning tree protocol; RSTP is used to get better results.

abstract={Localization is extensively used in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) to identify the current location of the sensor nodes. A WSN consist of thousands of nodes that make the installation of GPS on each sensor node expensive and moreover GPS will not provide exact localization results in an indoor environment. Manually configuring location reference on each sensor node is also not possible in the case of dense network. This gives rise to a problem where the sensor nodes must identify its current location without using any special hardware like GPS and without the help of manual configuration. Localization techniques makes the deployment of WSNs economical. Most of the localization techniques are carried out with the help of anchor node or beacon node, which knows its present location. Based on the location information provided by the anchor node or beacon node, other nodes localize themselves. In this paper we present a succinct survey on the localization techniques used in wireless sensor networks covering its problems and research gap. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

abstract={Sometimes it becomes very difficult to identify the valuable text written by some great personalities; especially when the text is not having a signature or the author is anonymous. Deserted manuscripts or documents without a title or heading can be an additional pain. It might happen that the work of dignitaries are lost or only some part of their valuable piece of work is found available in the libraries or with other storage medias. By deploying Zipfs law with the NLTK module available in python, this problem can be solved to a great extent, helping save the originality of the valuable texts and not leaving them unidentified. This can also be helpful in some real time data analysis where frequency plays an important role; plagiarism detection in written texts is one such example. NLTK is a strong toolkit which helps in extracting, segmenting, parsing, tagging and searching etc. of many natural languages with the help of python modules. In this paper it has been tried to combine Zipfs Law with NLTK to come up with a tool to identify the anonymous or deserted valuable texts. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

abstract={In this information age, providing security over the Internet is a major issue. Internet security is all about trust at a remote distance, because we are dealing with everyone remotely and not able to confirm identity or authenticity in the traditional sense. To increase the password authentication a scheme was proposed by Chun-Ta Li which is basically a smart card-based password authentication and update scheme. The Chuns scheme provides user anonymity and eviction of unauthorized users. In our research work we have crypt analyze the Chuns method and shown that it is vulnerable to various types of attacks: insider attack, off line password verifier attack, stolen verifier attack and impersonating attack. To overcome the security vulnerability of Chuns scheme, we have proposed an advance scheme of password authentication and user anonymity using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and stegnography. The proposed scheme also provides privacy to the client. Based on scheme performance criteria such as immunity to known attacks and functional features, we came to the conclusion that the proposed scheme is much efficient and solves several hard security threats. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={In recent years, nanoscience and nanotechnology have emerged as a new area of fundamental science and are receiving global attention due to their extensive applications. Conventionally nanoparticles were manufactured by physical and chemical techniques. The recent development and implementation of new technologies have led to a new trend, the nano-revolution unfolding the role of plants in bio- and green synthesis of nanoparticles which seems to have drawn a quite unequivocal attention to the synthesis of stable nanoparticles. Although nanoparticles can be synthesized through many conventional methods, biological route of the synthesis is more competent than the physical and chemical techniques. Biologically synthesized nanoparticles have enjoyed an upsurge of applications in various sectors. Hence, the present study envisions biosynthesis of nanoparticles from plants which are emerging as nanofactories. Hence, the present review summarizes the literature reported thus far and envisions plants as emerging sources of nanofactories along with applications, the mechanism behind phytosynthesis of nanoparticles and the mechanism of antibacterial action of nanoparticles. © 2014 Vietnam Academy of Science & Technology},

It is observed that the surface of plasma treated polyester is more hydrophilic due to incorporation of nitrogenous polar functional groups and shows different conformational composition and crystallinity. The ATR–FTIR results clearly indicate the conversion of trans ethylene glycol residue to gauche one after plasma treatment and thus reduction in crystallinity. Plasma treatment has shown synergetic effect on dye uptake.

abstract={In the present paper, some reliability measures of a computer system of two cold standby identical units are obtained using a semi-Markov process and a regenerative point technique. For this purpose, a reliability model is proposed by considering independent h/w and s/w failure. Initially, one unit is operative and another is kept as spare in cold standby. A single server is provided to conduct preventive maintenance, repair, replacement and up-gradation of the components upon their failure. Then, a maximum operation time system undergoes preventive maintenance, directly from normal mode. If the repair of the h/w is not possible by the server up to a pre-specific time, it is replaced by a new one with some replacement time. However, only up-gradation of the software by a new one is made whenever s/w fails to execute the desired function properly. Priority to h/w repair is given over h/w replacement and s/w up-gradation. The failure time distribution of the h/w and s/w follows a negative exponential while the distributions of preventive maintenance, repair, up-gradation and replacement time are taken as arbitrary with different probability density functions. To depict the importance of the study, graphs are drawn for a particular case with fixed values of other parameters and costs. © 2014 Jordan Journal of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering.},

Location information always plays a key role in Mobile wireless sensor network (MWSN) and precise localization has always been a challenge for mobile sensor nodes. Deploying GPS receivers for each node would render network deployment cost for a dense network. The unavailability of GPS in indoor and underground environment has also put the installation of GPS into question. This makes the sensor nodes to identify its location coordinates or location reference without using GPS, and is achieved with the help of a special node that knows its location coordinates and protocols, called beacon node.

abstract={Expressed sequence tags (EST) are potential source for the development of genic microsatellite markers, gene discovery, comparative genomics, and other genomic studies. In the present study, 7630 ESTs were examined from NCBI for SSR identification and characterization. A total of 263 SSRs were identified with an average density of one SSR/4.2 kb (3.4% frequency). Analysis revealed that trinucleotide repeats (47.52%) were most abundant followed by tetranucleotide (19.77%), dinucleotide (19.01%), pentanucleotide (9.12%), and hexanucleotide repeats (4.56%). Functional annotation was done through homology search and gene ontology, and 35 EST-SSRs were selected. Primer pairs were designed for evaluation of cross transferability and polymorphism among 11 plants belonging to five different families. Total 402 alleles were generated at 155 loci with an average of 2.6 alleles/locus and the polymorphic information content (PIC) ranged from 0.15 to 0.92 with an average of 0.75. The cross transferability ranged from 34.84% to 98.06% in different plants, with an average of 67.86%. Thus, the validation study of annotated 35 EST-SSR markers which correspond to particular metabolic activity revealed polymorphism and evolutionary nature in different families of Angiospermic plants. © 2014 Shamshad ul Haq et al.},

abstract={Nanoporous gold (npg) produced by dealloying of Au alloys has been recently proposed for many different applications from catalysis to bio-sensors. Furthermore, Au alloys constitute an important model system in the context of corrosion, dealloying, and stress corrosion cracking. Adsorbed self-assembled monolayers of thiol molecules inhibit the dealloying reaction. On thiol-modified Cu-Au alloys dealloying finally proceeds in a localized reaction instead of a homogeneous process. Using ethanethiols as an example, we show here that thiols can be effectively removed by application of anodic oxidation. Homogeneous porosity forms then after an oxidation step. In-situ X-ray diffraction and crystal truncation rod analysis of ethanethiol-modified Au (001) confirms that a bare Au surface is recovered after a similar oxidation step. In consequence, a multi-step dealloying process including complete initial thiol-layers as well as partially or fully re-cleaned surfaces can produce different micro-cracks, providing larger scale openings, and homogeneous nanoporous Au in between. Such hierarchically structured surfaces may show superior applicability for reactions where mass transport into the porous layer plays a decisive role for the reaction rate or detection probability. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Wireless networks are becoming a combination of more and more diverse and complicated networks. Handoff is a process to maintain data session continuity where mobile node changes from one base station coverage area to another base station area. Mobile maintains its existing connections via vertical handoff. In wireless environment single node mobility is known as host mobility and group of nodes moving together as single network is known as Network Mobility (NEMO). NEMO is extension of MIPv6, invented for reducing number of individual handoffs. To influence smooth mobility between these heterogeneous wireless access networks, expeditious and dependable vertical handoff (VHO) schemes are required. While taking VHO decision several parameters has to consider like received signal strength (RSS), addressable bandwidth, power intake, monetary cost, security, user predilection and etc. In this paper various handoff decision techniques based on different parameters for host mobility, and vertical handoff technique for Network mobility (NEMO) are discussed. Finally gave research issues and future research directions to NEMO. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Wireless Sensor Networks are known for their wide range of applications in which no human intervention is required. But the main challenge of Wireless Sensor Networks lies in achieving communications with low energy consumption. In order to overcome the problem of energy consumption, a well-known clustering algorithm, LEACH (Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy) was designed. However, LEACH has some disadvantages. In this paper, we propose a new clustering algorithm based on LEACH. It establishes a new Threshold which includes the node energy and distance between node and base station and distance between cluster head and base station for measuring the threshold value. Simulation results show that proposed algorithm is better than LEACH in balancing the node energy and thus enhancing the network lifetime. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The main aim of the present paper is to analyze the stochastic behavior of a cold standby system with concept of preventive maintenance, priority and maximum repair time. For this purpose, a stochastic model is developed in which initially one unit is operative and other is kept as cold standby. There is a single server who visits the system immediately as and when required. The server takes the unit under preventive maintenance after a maximum operation time at normal mode if one standby unit is available for operation. If the repair of the failed unit is not possible up to a maximum repair time, failed unit is replaced by new one. The failure time, maximum operation time and maximum repair time distributions of the unit are considered as exponentially distributed while repair and maintenance time distributions are considered as arbitrary. All random variables are statistically independent and repairs are perfect. Various measures of system effectiveness are obtained by using the technique of semi-Markov process and RPT. To highlight the importance of the study numerical results are also obtained for MTSF, availability and profit function. © 2015 Growing Science Ltd. All Right reserved.},

Moreover neighbor node detects and prevents black hole attack using real time monitoring. The new proposed method is effective for multiple sessions. The concept of broadcasting is being used in the method. Node which replies to RouteRequest (RREQ) by source is being monitored in promiscuous mode. Detection of malicious node is actually done by neighbor node of RouteReply (RREP) sender node. In simulation, new method has shown outstanding result in terms of packet delivery ratio as compare to AODVrouting protocol in presence of malicious node under black hole attack. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={The use of mobile agents for collaborative processing in wireless sensor network has gained considerable attention. This is when mobile agents are used for data aggregation to exploit redundant and correlated data. The efficiency of agent-based data aggregation depends on the agent migration scheme. However, in general, most of the proposed schemes are centralized approach-based schemes where the sink node determines the migration paths for the agents before dispatching them in the sensor network. The main limitations with such schemes are that they need global network topology information for deriving the migration paths of the agents, which incurs additional communication overhead, since each node has a very limited communication range. In addition, a centralized approach does not provide fault tolerant and adaptive migration paths. In order to solve such problems, we have proposed a distributed approach-based scheme for determining the migration path of the agents where at each hop, the local information is used to decide the migration of the agents. In addition, we also propose a local repair mechanism for dealing with the faulty nodes. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme performs better than existing schemes in the presence of faulty nodes within the networks, and manages to report the aggregated data to the sink faster. © 2015 KIPS.},

abstract={Surface geometry plays an important role in case of analyte sensing and RF switching using beams and electrodes. In general, rather than simply supported beam and diaphragm, microcantilever beams are widely preferred in BIO-MEMS and RF-MEMS for biosensing and RF switching, respectively. The lower level detection ability and simple structure make these cantilevers more applicable in many applications. The rectangular cantilever beams are most widely used in TG detection. but due to their constant or planner geometry and non-adhesion of analyte they are less sensitive in case of nano or pico level biosensing. This paper introduces the fractal surface geometry concept for increasing the deflection sensitivity corresponding to lower molecular or analyte loading. The rectangular and stepped cantilever beam structures along with fractal surface are simulated and analysed for TG molecular pressure 294.3 Pa. Both the rectangular and stepped microcantilever beams with fractal surface exhibit better free end or tip deflection (nearly 2×) as compare to the planner surface based beam. The proposed fractal concept also reduces the actuation voltage requirement for perfect switching. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={The present paper addresses the solution for gene subset selection problem with the help of proposed hybrid model for the binary class classification task under supervised learning. As established facts that filter approach is better than wrapper in terms of computational efficiency and time consumption. On the other hand, accuracy of wrapper is higher in comparison to filter. The dilemma faced by the researchers, can be minimised by developing a hybrid model to utilise the efficiency of the filter and accuracy of wrapper together to get the best possible outcome in terms of optimum accuracy. Here the selection of filter is as ReliefF algorithm and wrapper as randomised gene subset selection algorithm. The proposed model is, to first applying an accurate filter, to find out most relevant gene and further applying the efficient wrapper to extract most informative gene from the previous one and optimum gene subset is appreciated by linear as well as an ensemble classifier to classify public domain viz. leukaemia, ovarian cancer, lymphomas and prostate tumour datasets with fivefold cross validation calculation and also signifies the performance measures of the classifiers along with time measurement. The obtained results justify the applicability of the proposed method. Copyright © 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={In Bioinformatics, gene dataset experiments are generating thousands of gene expression measurements, which generally used to collect information from tissue and cell samples regarding gene expression differences. Optimum gene selection from such gene expression datasets and their classification plays an important role for disease prediction & diagnosis. Further the task ahead to understand that, what is the best way of gene selection to get maximum classification accuracy from such high dimensional gene expression dataset, whether the filter is the best way to rely upon or wrapper approach can be the best suitable, beyond that which classifier works well with filter and with wrapper? To answer the question, in this paper, the performance of the filter vs. wrapper gene selection technique is being evaluated by supervised classifiers over three well known public domain datasets viz. Ovarian Cancer, Lymphomas & Leukemia. For optimal gene selection, ReliefF method is used as a filter based gene selection and Random gene subset selection algorithm is used as a wrapper based gene selection. For classification, different linear as well as an ensemble classifiers have been tested for their performances. This paper also tries to bring the fact of timing details so that through analysis, it can get derived upon that which approach is more appropriate for better time management as well as with high accuracy of the selected dataset. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={This work aims to reveal the underlying effect of improved power factor on the life of Self Ballasted Fluorescent Lamps commonly termed as CFL. In the third world country like India because of cost effectiveness CFLs are still used without any power factor correction circuitry. Recently the power factor improvement tool is made compulsive for CFL and the recommended range as suggested by IEC 61000-3-2 is greater than 0.85. In addition to this the current harmonic distortion is preferred to be around 30% as per the standards. But unfortunately there are still CFLs available in the market which have less power factor in comparison with the desired standards. This has caused substantial problems not only on the generation side, but it certainly has considerable impact on the lamp performance. In the present work in order to exemplify this problem, four CFLs of 15W each from two different manufacturers are used for the experiment. Out of these four lamps, two lamps are ballast with low input power factor and instant start type. The other two are incorporated with improved input power factor having rapid start or warm start circuitry. The lamps are constantly switched ON and OFF at regular intervals. The interval was taken as 5 minutes ON and 5 minutes OFF. The lamps were subjected to this accelerated switching test. At the end of every switching cycle the electrode temperature was calculated from the ratio of hot resistance to cold resistance. It was thus observed that lamps with instant start ballast and poor power factor were unable to sustain the switching stress as compared to the lamps with rapid start ballast and improved power factor. Furthermore, the rise in electrode temperature for the lamps with improved power factor was within the desired standards. Thus it was concluded that lamps with poor power factor was more prone to early end in comparison with the other variety. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, multi-walled carbon nanotubes are synthesized by arc-discharge and chemical vapor decomposition methods. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes are synthesized on thin film of nickel sputtered on silicon substrate by thermal chemical vapor deposition of acetylene at a temperature of 750°C. The flow of current in arc-discharge method varies in the range 50–200 A. Further arc-synthesized carbon nanotubes are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and the results are compared with nanotubes grown by chemical vapor deposition method. XRD result shows a characteristic peak (0 0 2) at 26.54° corresponding to the presence of carbon nanotubes. SEM and TEM results give morphology of as-synthesized multi-walled nanotubes. TEM results indicate synthesis of well-graphitized carbon nanotubes by arc-discharge method. Dispersion of arc-synthesized nanotubes in SDS solution under the effect of different sonication times is studied. Dispersion of nanotubes in SDS solution is analyzed using UV–vis–NIR spectroscopy and it shows an absorption peak at 260 nm. It was found that with the increase in sonication time, the absorption peak in UV–vis–NIR spectra will increase and optimum sonication time was 2 hours. Functionalization of synthesized carbon nanotubes by H2SO4 and HNO3 acids has been studied and analysis of functionalized groups has been done using FT-IR spectroscopy and compared and the results are reported in this paper. FT-IR spectroscopy verifies the presence of carboxylic groups attached to carbon nanotubes. These functional groups may change properties of carbon nanotubes and may be used in vast applications of carbon nanotubes. © 2015 The Author(s).

abstract={In this study, the authors propose a novel extended continuous time birth-death model for reliability analysis of a nanocell device. A nanocell consists of conducting nanoparticles connected via randomly placed self-assembled monolayer of molecules. These molecules behave as a negative differential resistor. The mathematical expression for expected nanocell lifetime and its availability, in presence of transient errors is computed. On the basis of the model, an algorithm is developed and implemented in MATLAB, PERL and HSPICE, to automatically generate the proposed model representation for a given nanocell. It is used to estimate the success_ratio as well as the nanocell reliability, while considering the uncertainties induced by transient errors. The theoretical results for reliability are validated by simulating HSPICE model of nanocell in presence of varying defect rates. It is observed that the device reliability increases with increase in the number of nanoparticles and molecules. A lower and upper bounds for nanocell reliability are calculated in theory which is validated in simulations. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2015.},

abstract={Structuring public private partnerships (PPP) in railways is a challenge, given its technology base, and obligation as a public and affordable mode of transportation. The sector provides strong incentives for vertical integration due to economies of scope. However, it is evident from the literature that large integrated PPPs in railway systems are not feasible due to higher commercial risks. They also suffer from implicit cross subsidization since the railway infrastructure is capital intensive, common to multiple revenue sources, and fare box revenues are generally not sufficient to recover investments. This is being addressed by various unbundling approaches in recent PPPs. The common unbundling is between infrastructure, operations, and services.The objective of this research is to explore the potential of unbundling further and to come up with a framework that helps policy makers in taking macro level decisions on PPP structuring. The research disaggregates the railway system into over 40 elements wherein an element is the smallest unit that can be given to a party for execution. However this unbundling would result in significant horizontal and vertical interfaces between these elements.A sustainable PPP would need to limit the extent of interfaces due to transaction costs and risks. This can be achieved by bundling the elements horizontally and/or vertically into entities to extract the best value for a PPP. The governing principles would be scale economies (horizontal integration), scope economies (vertical integration), need for competition (horizontal disaggregation), level playing field, transactional transparency, and need for specialization (vertical disaggregation). Additional drivers would be appetite for investment, availability of competence and accountability for an entity. The findings of the research indicate that the entity formation is one of the most crucial aspects of a PPP in railways.A consequential critical area is managing the interfaces between entities, which are subject to transaction costs and risks. These should be carefully identified and addressed by well-designed contractual agreements and independent regulation. © 2014 World Conference on Transport Research Society.},

abstract={Chemical modifications including Ag nanoparticle deposition have been performed on electrochemically formed mesoporous silicon (PS) to optimize confinement and templating of molecular systems within PS as well as to modify the electronic properties of both the host and the guest. A complete quenching of photoluminescence (PL) of PS along with a considerable change of the optical properties of the dye rhodamine 6G (R6G) in PS has been achieved. For all states of preparation of the sample, PL, UV/vis transmission spectroscopy and electrical measurements were carried out. From our transmission and electrical measurements we concluded that the quenching of PL is attributed to a fundamental disruption of the luminescence mechanism. A blue shift in the PL peak of R6G in PS compared to bulk R6G is attributed to an efficient quantum confinement effect. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.},

abstract={In this paper, a novel Differential Search Algorithm (DSA) approach is proposed to solve multiobjective optimization problems, called Multiobjective Differential Search Algorithm (MODSA). MODSA utilizes the concept of Pareto dominance to determine the direction of a super-organism and it maintains non-dominated solutions in the external repository. This approach also uses the external repository of super-organisms that is used to guide other super-organisms. It guides the artificial organisms to search towards non-crowding and external regions of Pareto front. The performance of proposed approach is evaluated against the other well-known multiobjective optimization algorithms over a set of multiobjective benchmark test functions. Experimental results reveal that the MODSA outperforms the other competitive algorithms for benchmark test functions. © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Feature selection is an optimization problem that selects the features that have minimum redundancy and maximum relevance to improve the efficiency of algorithms. In this paper, we have proposed a novel automatic unsupervised feature selection method based on gravitational search algorithm, called AFSGSA (automatic feature selection using gravitational search algorithm). In contrast to most of existing unsupervised feature selection techniques, the proposed AFSGSA requires no prior knowledge of the data to be classified and number of features to be selected. AFSGSA determines the optimal number of features of the data-set on the run. Statistical property of data-set is used to develop a novel threshold setting concept to refine the features. A novel fitness function is also proposed to make the search more efficient. The performance of AFSGSA has been compared with recently developed well-known feature selection techniques. The experimental results reveal the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed feature selection technique over other existing techniques. © 2014 by the IETE.},

abstract={The goal of this investigation is to study the three layered (core layer, intermediate layer, and peripheral layer) tubular flow of power law fluids with variable viscosity by peristalsis in order to investigate the strength of the role played by an artificially generated intermediate layer to ease constipation.The solution is carried out under the long wavelength and low Reynolds number approximations in the wave frame of reference as the flow is creeping one.The stream functions for each layer such as core layer, intermediate layer, and peripheral layer are determined.The expressions for axial pressure gradient, interfaces, trapping, and reflux limits are obtained. The effects of power law index and viscosities on pressure across one wavelength, mechanical efficiency, and trapping are discussed numerically. It is found that the pressure required to restrain flowrates and the mechanical efficiency increase with the viscosities of the intermediate and peripheral layers as well as with the flow behaviour index. It is observed that the axisymmetric flow in intestines is less prone to constipation than two-dimensional flow and may be more easily overcome with introducing a viscous intermediate layer. © 2015 S.

The charge reorganization in Dy1-xErxAl2 (x=0, 0.2), on the formation of compound, has been discussed using the valence band Compton profile data. The experimental Compton profile data unambiguously establish charge transfer from Al to Dy (Dy and Er) on formation of x=0.0 (0.2) compound, which is in tune with spin polarized relativistic Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (SPR-KKR) calculations.

Routing in MANETs is carried out with the help of broadcasting schemes, among which MPR is found to be the effectual and uncomplicated scheme. The MPR scheme broadcasts its messages only to the selected MPR nodes. The selected MPR node may be any node in the network, and there are no obligatory and adequate conditions that provides assurance about the selected node’s integrity. In this paper, we have proposed a novel approach in the MPR node selection, by adding a security feature prior to the MPR node selection.

abstract={A biofluid dynamics mathematical model is developed to study peristaltic flow of non-Newtonian physiological liquid in a two-dimensional asymmetric channel containing porous media as a simulation of obstructed digestive (intestinal) transport. The fractional Oldroyd-B viscoelastic rheological model is utilized. The biophysical flow regime is constructed as a wave-like motion and porous medium is simulated with a modified Darcy-Brinkman model. This model is aimed at describing the digestive transport in intestinal tract containing deposits which induce impedance. A low Reynolds number approximation is employed to eliminate inertial effects and the wavelength to diameter ratio is assumed to be large. The differential transform method (DTM), a semi-computational technique is employed to obtain approximate analytical solutions to the boundary value problem. The influences of fractional (rheological material) parameters, relaxation time, retardation time, amplitude of the wave, and permeability parameter on peristaltic flow characteristics such as volumetric flow rate, pressure difference and wall friction force are computed.

abstract={Education data classification is a growing interest in the research of data mining. Correctly identifying the education data into particular category is still presenting challenge because of large and vast amount of features in the dataset. In regards to the existing classifying approaches, Naïve Bayes is potentially good at serving as a classification model due to its simplicity and accuracy. Naive Bayes is one of the most efficient and effective algorithms for data mining. The aim of this paper is to highlight the performance of employing Naïve Bayes in education data classification. The data extracted could be used to Find Meaningful Pattern for the students on the real time problem scenario application to be monitored at college level. Also the model can be used for the future planning of student selection criteria at college level. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Localization is extensively used in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) to identify the current location of the sensor nodes. A WSN consist of thousands of nodes that make the installation of GPS on each sensor node expensive and moreover GPS will not provide exact localization results in an indoor environment. Manually configuring location reference on each sensor node is also not possible in the case of dense network This gives rise to a problem where the sensor nodes must identify its current location without using any special hardware like GPS and without the help of manual configuration. Localization techniques make the deployment of WSNs economical. Most of the localization techniques are carried out with the help of anchor node or beacon node, which knows its present location. Based on the location information provided by the anchor node or beacon node, other nodes localize themselves. In this paper we present a succinct survey on the localization techniques used in wireless sensor networks covering its problems and research gap. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={The present research protocol was developed to locate endophytic fungi present inside the healthy leaves of Tinospora cordifolia. The surface sterilized leaf explants after staining with lactophenol cotton blue showed the presence of endophytic fungi in intercellular spaces of ground, dermal tissue especially in midrib region. Leaves have shown dense colonies of endophytic fungi. Microscopic examination of in vitro and in vivo leaves has shown mycelium which was dense, branched and septate. Hence, the comparative study was conducted in both in vitro and in vivo leaves of T. cordifolia to locate endophytic fungi. The present study revealed that the fungi are not only developed in plants under natural environment but also under controlled conditions i.e. tissue culture of plants. Therefore, the present research work favoured the view that endophytes can infect nutrient medium of in vitro culture of T. cordifolia and diversity of endophytic fungi increase after hardening and acclimatization of T. cordifolia plantlets. The presence of endophytes in in vitro cultures depends both on age of tissue and host genotype. Further studies are required to isolate the endophytic fungi, pure culture on PDA plates and their identification to explore their biosynthetic pathway. © 2015 Elsevier GmbH.},

abstract={Spin-polarized Compton profiles of TbCo2 have been measured to elucidate the interesting behavior of spin and orbital moments at different temperatures. The magnetic Compton profiles (MCPs) have been analyzed in terms of site specific spin moments due to Tb-4f electrons, Co and itinerant electrons. The temperature dependence of the orbital moment has been deduced using Compton and magnetometry data ranging between 6 and 300 K. The present data exhibit a decrease in the ratio of orbital to spin moments from 43.9% to 35.0% (while going from 6 to 300 K). First-principles calculations within DFT + U scheme have also been performed to confirm the spin-, orbital- and site specific-magnetic moments in TbCo2. An antiparallel exchange coupling between the Tb-4f and Co spin moments is found. The orbital moment is found to have a parallel coupling with the Tb spin moment, as evident from the experimental MCPs. From first-principles data it is seen that the orbital moments of Tb and Co sites are antiparallel to each other, as in the case of their spin magnetic moments. The present experimental study also shows an existence of an itinerant moment which is coupled ferromagnetically with the Tb-4f spin moment. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Key message: Pithecellobium dulcehas a huge repository of morphological and genetic diversity within the species which has been documented for further tree research and breeding programmes. Abstract: A total of 40 accessions of a multipurpose leguminous tree, Pithecellobium dulce, differing in morphological and phenological characteristics was collected from different locations in Rajasthan and genetic diversity assessed using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers. Out of 60 RAPD primers, 43 decamer primers produced 311 scorable bands of which 223 bands were polymorphic. Polymorphic banding patterns with the number of amplified fragments varied from 1 (OPA-12 and OPF-17) to 12 (OPF-04, OPT-07, OPT-17, OPT-20). Percent polymorphism ranged from 33.3 % (OPF-07, OPA-20, OPT-05) to 89 % (OPA-13) with an average of 64.34 %. Out of the 20 ISSR primers screened, 8 primers produced 77 amplification products of which 55 were polymorphic. The number of bands amplified per primer varied between 6 (UBC-820) and 13 (UBC-808 and UBC-816) with average band size between 300 and 4,500 bp. Percent polymorphism ranged from 38 % (UBC-817) to 100 % (UBC-811) with an average of 71 %. Dendrogram constructed on the basis of combined RAPD and ISSR markers separated the accessions into five distinct clusters at 53 % variation with Jaccard’s similarity coefficient ranging from minimum similarity (0.35) between Karoli (K) and Malviya Nagar, Jaipur (MN1) to maximum similarity (0.81) between two populations of Kota (K1 and K2). The matrices for two markers, RAPD and ISSR, were also compared using Mantel’s test. The correlation value between the matrices is high (r = 0.83) indicating good correlation between the two molecular marker systems. The study indicated a high level of morphological and genetic diversity in P. dulce. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={In this paper, a novel design of diaphragm based pressure sensor has been proposed, which may find its application in Intra Uterine Pressure Catheter (IUPC) system. The novelty of the device lies in the fact that it has got patterned slots over the top layer of the diaphragm similar to a chess-board pattern. This sensor is then compared with a plane diaphragm of same dimensions. In same range of input pressure, results show that the plane diaphragm has capacitive sensitivity of 0.06385 pF/kPa, while in the slotted diaphragm, it is 0.17355 pF/kPa, three times as that of the plane one. However, the static pull-in voltage comes out to be almost 16 volt due to constant air gap of 0.4 μm for both the cases. Due to pull-in voltage in the range of 11-20 volts, it can also be used as an electrostatic actuator in switching networks. © 2015 IEEE.},

Biogeography basically is the study of the geographical distribution of the biological organism. Biogeography based optimization is a comparatively new approach. Mathematical models of biogeography explain how an organism arises and how to migrate from one habitat to another habitat, or get died out. In BBO algorithm, solutions are sharing the good features between solutions that are immigration and emigration process. This algorithm looks for the overall optimum solution mostly through two steps - Migration and Mutation. Results are obtained on the different-different population size and different-different number of trials. The Results of the proposed method have been compared with results of IEEE 30-bus, 6 generator system and got the better quality of the obtained solution. This method is one of the important approaches for solving the Economic Load Dispatch problems under practical conditions. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={In present days, power crisis increasing due to increase the consumers load. To overcome this problem some optimization techniques have been used to solve the economic load dispatch problem. This paper presents an efficient and reliable Biogeography Based Optimization (BBO) algorithm, which is used to solve the Economic Load Dispatch problem of thermal power station even as generator and transmission constraints are considered and satisfying it. Biogeography basically is the study of the geographical distribution of the biological organism. Biogeography based optimization is a comparatively new approach. Mathematical models of biogeography explain how an organism arises and how to migrate from one habitat to another habitat, or get died out. In BBO algorithm, solutions are sharing the good features between solutions that are immigration and emigration process. This algorithm looks for the overall optimum solution mostly through two steps - Migration and Mutation. The Results of the proposed method have been compared with results of IEEE 30-bus, 6 generator system and got the better quality of the obtained solution. This method is one of the prominent approaches for solving the Economic Load Dispatch problems under practical conditions. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={The process of bioweathering involving natural microbes, natural plants and transgenic animals has proven to be a very efficient and effective tool for detoxifying xenobiotics. The present investigation uses the same tool as a device for detoxifying asbestos, a potent carcinogenic entity. The cellular mechanism of asbestos toxicity to a certain extent, as shown by research, is attributed to its chemical composition particularly the presence of iron in its structure. Many bacteria release iron chelating compounds, siderophores, which could be instrumental in the study. Treatment of asbestos was carried out under specific parameters with bacterial isolates native to the mines of Rajasthan from which asbestos was collected. An assessment was then done to evaluate reduction in iron content of the asbestos fibres by Scanning Electron Microscopy-Energy Dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX). A remarkable decrease was observed in the iron content of asbestos following treatment with most of the bacterial isolates used, which probably could form the basis for asbestos bioweathering studies. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={The purpose of this study is to closely examine the evidence of decoupling of economic growth from environmental degradation as experienced by OECD member countries. In order to analyze these aspects and to explore the comparative assessment, this work has utilized available statistical data of OECD. The study employed DPSIR methods outlined in the OECD report, which state that Indicators measure the decoupling of environmental pressure from economic growth for analyzing environmental pressure/degradation indicators, such as population growth, energy production, greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, CO2emission, SOx emission, NOx emission, water abstraction and waste with economic indicator, i.e., nominal and per capita GDP. The major finding of this study is that among the selected indicators, some resulted from relative decoupling rather than absolute decoupling, which means that the environmental pressure still increases, albeit at a lower rate than economic performance, and that the presence of decoupling is not an indication for sustainable economic development. © 2015 Taylor and Francis.},

abstract={Due to its large scale applications in the real field, the study of bi-metallic nano-alloy clusters is an active field of research. Though a number of experimental reports are available in this domain, a deep theoretical insight is yet to receive. Among several nano-clusters, the compound formed between Cu-Ag has gained a large importance due to its remarkable optical property. Density Functional Theory (DFT) is one of the most popular approaches of quantum mechanics to study the electronic properties of materials. Conceptually, DFT based descriptors have turned to be indispensable tools for analyzing and correlating the experimental properties of compounds. In this venture, we have analyzed the experimental properties of the (Cu-Ag)n=1-7 nano-alloy clusters invoking DFT methodology. A nice correlation has been found between optical properties of the aforesaid nano-clusters with our evaluated theoretical descriptors. The similar agreement between experimental bond length and computed data is also reflected in this analysis. Beside these, the effect of even-odd alternation behavior of nano compounds on the HOMO-LUMO gap is very important in our computation. It is probably the first attempt to establish such type of correlation. © 2015 Prabhat Ranjan et al.},

abstract={In this paper, a novel design of a compact planar ultra wide band (UWB) monopole antenna with triple band notched characteristics has been presented. The antenna has a unique shape and has been fed through a 50 ω microstrip feedline. The strength of the antenna lies in three band notched properties for WiMax system at 3.3-3.7 GHz, WLAN IEEE 802.11a at 5.15-5.85 GHz and X band satellite communication at 7.25-8.395 GHz. The notched bands have been achieved by incorporating an inverted U-slot etched on the radiator patch, an inverted C-slot also on the radiator patch and a U-slot on the microstrip feed line. In order to achieve FCC defined impedance bandwidth of 7.5 GHz, a rectangular cut in the ground plane has been introduced along with staircase structure in the bottom edge of the radiator. The proposed antenna is having a compact size of 30 X 30 X 1.6 mm3 and exhibits a large bandwidth from 2.8 GHz to 10.7 GHz. The antenna has been successfully simulated and fabricated. The radiation pattern is omni-directional in H-plane and the E-plane exhibits dipole like radiation pattern. The gain of the antenna is stable across the whole operating frequency band except at three notched bands. © 2015 SBMO/SBMag.},

The gaseous and solid products were used to generate heat and electrical power, whereas the bio-oil was stored and supplied for other applications. The overall efficiency of the base case model was estimated for conversion of biomass into useable forms of bio-energy. It was found that the proposed design is not only significantly efficient but also potentially suitable for distributed operation of pyrolysis plants having centralised post processing facilities for production of other biofuels and chemicals. It was further determined that the bio-oil quality improved using a multi-stage condensation system. However, the recycling of flue gases coming from combustor instead of non-condensable gases in the pyrolyzer led to increase in the overall efficiency of the process with degradation of bio-oil quality. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},
