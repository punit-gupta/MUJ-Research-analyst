In hierarchical NEMO, due to the high degree of nesting in mobile network, pinball routing problem, inefficient route and end to end delay in packet transmission are quite common. Therefore, considering these problems, we have come up with a solution called Route Optimization for Inter and Intra Network (ROIIN) which will provide one tunnel solution in case of inter-network packet transmission and an efficient route optimization in case of intra-network communications. The proposed solution is simulated in NS2 and the observed results of our simulation shows better efficiency as compared to the existing solutions.

Currently, a lot of work has been done and is looked after to establish effective communication and message passing among the vehicles (V2V and V2I routing) with a number of algorithmic models developed. The paper presents a survey of the routing algorithms proposed to have communication inside a VANET among the nodes. Since V2V and V2I interactions is a complex combinatorial problem which falls under the class of NP-Complete set of problems. The paper here presents a modified mobicast routing version using genetic algorithm with certain considerations for mutation and crossover operator for the algorithm in order to achieve more accuracy for the results. The method shows a great enhancement in the execution timing for a considerable number of vehicles where the traditional algorithms may hang up to produce a route. But still the serial version stucks up for heavy density vehicle scenarios for message passing in real time. So, the efficiency of the proposed method is enhanced using parallel processing power of multi-core and many-core processors using OpenMP and Computationally Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) API. The enhanced results show a great improvement in the performance in terms of execution time when compared with the serial algorithm, especially for the cases where the solutions cannot be obtained in real time. The results over GPU based architecture suggests that the proposed method has a huge potential to scale up with the vehicles on the road, thus, reducing the road side units for providing a larger range of coverage.

Considering the poor mechanical integrity of ceramic and polymeric materials, metallic implants such as magnesium based alloy foams can be used as a promising scaffold material for bone tissue engineering. Magnesium foams also have properties like excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability so that revision surgery can be completely eliminated after implantation in orthopaedic applications. Against this background, porous Mg alloy based bioactive nano-composite foams were developed. Nano-hydroxyapatite (n-HA) was used as bioactive reinforcement which was anticipated to enhance bone tissue regenerations. Magnesium based alloy compositions were developed by incorporating selective alloying elements, while the bioactive nano-composite foams were fabricated using powder metallurgy route. The powder metallurgy route involved sequential stages of mixing and compaction of all powders with carbamide powder as a space holding material, followed by sintering of the green compacts. The microstructures of these nano-ceramic reinforced metal matrix foams were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in combination with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray micro computed tomography (X-ray micro CT). Further, mechanical properties of the nanocomposite foams were evaluated. SEM and EDS results confirmed a homogeneous distribution of pores, alloying elements and n-HA. Structureâ€“property correlations were established through the microstructural characterizations. The study therefore demonstrated that selected Mg alloy based composite foam can be an excellent candidate material for bone tissue engineering.

There is a pressing demand to send the secret information in the hidden form. Conceal writing is an ultimate feature of steganography which fulfills this demand. In general; a robust steganography scheme should have better visual imperceptibility of the hidden information with sufficient payload. In this paper, a steganography method based on cryptography is proposed. The proposed scheme uses two processes; first, encrypt the secret plaintext (PT) message followed by secret image generation from this encrypted message. Second, hide this secret image into the cover image using Daubechies discrete wavelet transform operation followed by mixing operation. After performing the Daubechies inverse discrete wavelet transform (IDWT) process, we get the stego image. Stego image visual quality is increased by using Daubechies wavelet.

In the last two decades, there has been a plenteous study in energy harnessing. Now a day, energy harnessing using piezoelectric materials has drawn attention of researchers due to low cost, flexibility and light weight. The benefits of piezoelectric material can be utilized by designing a self-powered device for artificial nanoswimmer. Some of the ceramics which displays the piezoelectric effect are lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT), lead-titanate (PbTiO2), lead-zirconate (PbZrO3) and Barium Titanate (BaTiO3). PZT is most extensively used piezoelectric material in the field of energy harnessing but it is brittle in nature. Lead based piezoelectric materials are toxic in nature and may not suitable for in-vivo biomedical applications. To eradicate this problem, researchers are interested in synthesizing lead free piezoelectric material such as Aluminium Nitride (AIN), Barium Titanate (BaTiO3) and Polyvinylidenefluoride (PVDF). The biocompatibility of PVDF makes it appropriate to be used for energy harnessing in human body for applications like on board powering of nanoswimmer for various disease detection and drug delivery. In this paper, a cantilever beam is being simulated in COMSOL to study electric potential generated on the surface of beam made of different piezoelectric materials such as AIN, PVDF and PZT due to fluidic pressure, which will be utilized as energy for actuation of artificial nanoswimmer. Piezo-based cantilever beams have been compared and maximum electric potential is being observed in PVDF based beam. PVDF seems most promising piezoelectric material for in-vivo biomedical application and it is readily available.

The stability of a link is estimated dynamically during the route dis covery process using its signal strength and interference along with the relative mobility of nodes forming the link.

In contrast to most of existing unsupervised feature selection techniques, the proposed AFSGSA requires no prior knowledge of the data to be classified and number of features to be selected. AFSGSA determines the optimal number of features of the data-set on the run. Statistical property of data-set is used to develop a novel threshold setting concept to refine the features. A novel fitness function is also proposed to make the search more efficient. The performance of AFSGSA has been compared with recently developed well-known feature selection techniques.

This gives rise to a problem where the sensor nodes must identify its current location without using any special hardware like GPS and without the help of manual configuration. Localization techniques makes the deployment of WSNs economical. Most of the localization techniques are carried out with the help of anchor node or beacon node, which knows its present location.

The US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) had approved telavancin in 2009 for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSIs) caused by Gram-positive bacteria, including MRSA (S. aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus anginosus group, or Enterococcus faecalis). Telavancin has two proposed mechanisms of action. In vitro, telavancin has a rapid, concentration-dependent bactericidal effect, due to disruption of cell membrane integrity. Telavancin has demonstrable in vitro activity against aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria. Telavancin and vancomycin have similar spectra of activity. Gram-negative bacteria are usually non-susceptible to telavancin. Telavancin has been successfully tested in various animal models of bacteremia, endocarditis, meningitis, and pneumonia.

Telavancin extensively binds to serum albumin (similar to 93\\%) and has a relatively small volume of distribution. Telavancin is not biotransformed by any cytochrome P450 microsomal enzymes and excreted mainly in the urine. Though well-tolerated, worrisome adverse effects, including renal dysfunction and QTc prolongation are of potential concern.

The Jefferysâ€™ non-Newtonian constitutive model is employed to characterize rheological properties of the fluid. The unsteady conservation equations for mass and momentum with electro-kinetic and Darcian porous medium drag force terms are reduced to a system of steady linearized conservation equations in an axisymmetric coordinate system. The long wavelength, creeping (low Reynolds number) and Debyeâ€“HÃ¼ckel linearization approximations are utilized. The resulting boundary value problem is shown to be controlled by a number of parameters including the electro-osmotic parameter, Helmholtzâ€“Smoluchowski velocity (maximum electro-osmotic velocity), and Jefferysâ€™ first parameter (ratio of relaxation and retardation time), wave amplitude. The influence of these parameters and also time on axial velocity, pressure difference, maximum volumetric flow rate and streamline distributions (for elucidating trapping phenomena) is visualized graphically and interpreted in detail. Pressure difference magnitudes are enhanced consistently with both increasing electro-osmotic parameter and Helmholtzâ€“Smoluchowski velocity, whereas they are only elevated with increasing Jefferysâ€™ first parameter for positive volumetric flow rates. Maximum time averaged flow rate is enhanced with increasing electro-osmotic parameter, Helmholtzâ€“Smoluchowski velocity and Jefferysâ€™ first parameter. Axial flow is accelerated in the core (plug) region of the conduit with greater values of electro-osmotic parameter and Helmholtzâ€“Smoluchowski velocity whereas it is significantly decelerated with increasing Jefferysâ€™ first parameter.

In most such cases, the conventional communication infrastructure such as wired and cellular networks get damaged and therefore cannot provide communication required to exchange emergency information. Therefore, to cope with such disasters in a fast and coordinated way, the optimal provisioning of the emergency information is crucial. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) are the paramount components for such situations. UAVs can act as mobile base stations and facilitate wireless communication to connect to nearest working telephone network access point. A large scale disaster information system can be formed by combining UAV network with existing available network regardless of some of network lines being damaged and destroyed. In this paper, we have designed a prototype of UAV assisted emergency ad hoc network (EANET). We have also evaluated and compared AODV and ZRP routing protocols by varying the number of UAV assisted EANET nodes in different transmission range cases of disaster scenarios. The experimental results illustrate that ZRP is the most appropriate protocol for emergency situations.

Objectives: The present study is aimed to synthesize bio-compatible Yashada bhasma from bio-incompatible zinc metal. Further, comparative study of their chemical and physical properties through some quality control tests, physico-chemical tests and modern tests like XRD, DLS, Zeta potential, SEM and EDAX are carried out. Materials and methods: Yashada bhasma is prepared by a three step process i.e. Shodhan, Jarana and Marana. The inclusion of plant extracts and herbs during calcination process enhances its medicinal qualities, and reduces it to a nano size. Results: The XRD analysis of Yashada bhasma shows hexagonal ZnO crystalline phase whereas the raw metal confirms the presence of crystallite Zinc metal. DLS shows reduction in particle size of Yashada Bhasma (339.8 nm) as compared to raw metal (2063 nm) and this reduction is further supported by SEM which shows the particle size of Yashada bhasma (324 nm) and raw metal (1-2Î¼). The zeta potential value confirms the stability of Yashada bhasma. EDAX revealed difference in concentration of Zinc and Oxygen in both the samples. Conclusion: An effort has been made to characterize the preparation of Yashada bhasma using sophisticated analytical tools as a step towards standardization of the bhasma. The results help in scientifically establishing the findings in line with the principle of Ayurveda.

For this purpose, a reliability model is proposed by considering independent h/w and s/w failure. Initially, one unit is operative and another is kept as spare in cold standby. A single server is provided to conduct preventive maintenance, repair, replacement and up-gradation of the components upon their failure. Then, a maximum operation time system undergoes preventive maintenance, directly from normal mode. If the repair of the h/w is not possible by the server up to a pre-specific time, it is replaced by a new one with some replacement time. However, only up-gradation of the software by a new one is made whenever s/w fails to execute the desired function properly. Priority to h/w repair is given over h/w replacement and s/w up-gradation. The failure time distribution of the h/w and s/w follows a negative exponential while the distributions of preventive maintenance, repair, up-gradation and replacement time are taken as arbitrary with different probability density functions. To depict the importance of the study, graphs are drawn for a particular case with fixed values of other parameters and costs.

Biogeography basically is the study of the geographical distribution of the biological organism. Biogeography based optimization is a comparatively new approach. Mathematical models of biogeography explain how an organism arises and how to migrate from one habitat to another habitat, or get died out.

Using Floquet theory, we demonstrate the anisotropic behaviour of anomalous Rabi oscillations in phosphorene, which occurs far from the conventional resonance. The role of anisotropy on anomalous Rabi oscillations in phosphorene is also justified numerically. The Bloch-Siegert shift is observed under strong driving field that strongly depends on the anisotropy of the energy bands of phosphorene. A theoretical description of the pump-probe experiment is given to detect the anomalous Rabi oscillations in phosphorene. The differential transmission coefficient shows a sinusoidal behaviour as a function of pump pulse duration whose amplitude exhibits a power law decay, which is quite different from graphene (relativistic fermionic system).

We report a simple, sensitive and specific nano-technology based â€˜Nano-immuno testâ€™ capable of detecting viable MAP bacilli in the milk samples within 10Â h. Viable MAP bacilli were captured by MAP specific antibody-conjugated magnetic nano-particles using resazurin dye as chromogen. Test was optimized using true culture positive (10-bovine and 12-goats) and true culture negative (16-bovine and 25-goats) raw milk samples. Domestic livestock species in India are endemically infected with MAP. After successful optimization, sensitivity and specificity of the â€˜nano-immuno testâ€™ in goats with respect to milk culture was 91.7% and 96.0%, respectively. Whereas, it was 90.0% (sensitivity) and 92.6% (specificity) with respect to IS900 PCR. In bovine milk samples, sensitivity and specificity of â€˜nano-immuno testâ€™ with respect to milk culture was 90.0% and 93.7%, respectively. However, with respect to IS900 PCR, the sensitivity and specificity was 88.9% and 94.1%, respectively. Test was validated with field raw milk samples (goats-258 and bovine-138) collected from domestic livestock species to detect live/viable MAP bacilli. Of 138 bovine raw milk samples screened by six diagnostic tests, 81 (58.7%) milk samples were positive for MAP infection in one or more than one diagnostic tests. Of 81 (58.7%) positive bovine raw milk samples, only 24 (17.4%) samples were detected positive for the presence of viable MAP bacilli. Of 258 goats raw milk samples screened by six diagnostic tests, 141 (54.6%) were positive for MAP infection in one or more than one test. Of 141 (54.6%) positive raw milk samples from goats, only 48 (34.0%) were detected positive for live MAP bacilli. Simplicity and efficiency of this novel â€˜nano-immuno testâ€™ makes it suitable for wide-scale screening of milk samples in the field. Standardization, validation and re-usability of functionalized nano-particles and the test was successfully achieved in field samples. Test was highly specific, simple to perform and easy to read by naked eyes and does not require laboratory support in the performance of test. Test has potential to be used as screening test to estimate bio-load of MAP in milk samples at National level.

The detail electrochemical behavior leading to the anodic dissolution of copper, however, still remains uncertain. Herein, an Imidazopyrimidine Dye, named, 4-amino-3-(phenyldiazenyl)benzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-2(1H)-one, (APIP) has been used as a copper corrosion inhibitor in 3.5 wt.% (by weight) NaCl solution. The present investigation provides a brief mechanistic overview of the electrochemical mechanism of copper in aerated NaCl solution, simulating a static marine environment, with and without addition of APIP inhibitor. Potentiodynamic polarization (PDP) results confirmed that the APIP can suppress copper corrosion effectively at low concentration in 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution with an inhibition efficiency of 92.79% due to adsorption, along with the prediction of electrochemical mechanism. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements showed that the corrosion inhibition of Cu proceeds via both diffusion and kinetic controlled processes. Adsorption of APIP on copper surface is well fit with the Langmuir isotherm model and mode of adsorption is proposed. Antimicrobial activity was also studied and the result obtained showed â€˜â€˜eco-friendlyâ€™â€™ nature of APIP. Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM), Energy dispersion X-ray (EDX) and Attenuated Total Reflectance-Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) observations of the copper surfaces confirmed the existence of adsorption of APIP thus can be potentially used in industries in which seawater is implied are numerous such as cooling water systems, desalination plants, power plants, and oil production units. Results obtained from theoretical calculations including quantum chemical density functional theory (DFT) method and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations confirms the experimental findings and provide further insight into the mode of adsorption on the copper surface.

In general, rather than simply supported beam and diaphragm, microcantilever beams are widely preferred in BIO-MEMS and RF-MEMS for biosensing and RF switching, respectively. The lower level detection ability and simple structure make these cantilevers more applicable in many applications. The rectangular cantilever beams are most widely used in TG detection. but due to their constant or planner geometry and non-adhesion of analyte they are less sensitive in case of nano or pico level biosensing. This paper introduces the fractal surface geometry concept for increasing the deflection sensitivity corresponding to lower molecular or analyte loading. The rectangular and stepped cantilever beam structures along with fractal surface are simulated and analysed for TG molecular pressure 294.3 Pa. Both the rectangular and stepped microcantilever beams with fractal surface exhibit better free end or tip deflection (nearly 2Ã—) as compare to the planner surface based beam. The proposed fractal concept also reduces the actuation voltage requirement for perfect switching.

Owing these reasons various biologically sustainable methods of sludge reduction including the application of high oxygenation have been successfully tested. Experiments on actual sewage in two lab-scale sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) were conducted under normal (1.5â€“2.5 mgDO/L) and high dissolved oxygen (DO) (HDO: 3â€“6.5 mgDO/L) regimes. It was observed that microorganism allocated substrate between maintenance and growth in the form of maintenance coefficient. Which could be induced by endogenous respiration owing to high solids retention time (SRT), predation on bacteria, chemical toxicity, adverse environment, and viral attack on bacteria. The wastewater treatment process may experience one or more maintenance inducing factors; nevertheless, high SRT and prevailing environmental conditions are imminent and thus considered as primary maintenance (mp), while remaining are classified as secondary maintenance (ms). Average yield coefficient reduction at HDO was 32.7% and 28.2% compared to stoichiometric and at normal DO, respectively. The observed primary and secondary maintenance was 0.11gCOD/gVSS.d (Â±0.01) at an SRT of 25.2 d (Â±2.0) and 0.096 g 0.1 gCOD/gVSS.d (Â±0.045) at an SRT of 24.2 d (Â±3.6d), respectively.

There is a single server who visits the system immediately as and when required. The server takes the unit under preventive maintenance after a maximum operation time at normal mode if one standby unit is available for operation. If the repair of the failed unit is not possible up to a maximum repair time, failed unit is replaced by new one. The failure time, maximum operation time and maximum repair time distributions of the unit are considered as exponentially distributed while repair and maintenance time distributions are considered as arbitrary. All random variables are statistically independent and repairs are perfect. Various measures of system effectiveness are obtained by using the technique of semi-Markov process and RPT.

The spur gear was considered for this study for two different loading conditions, torques of 150 Nm and 200 Nm. The involute profile of the spur gear was generated using an ANSYS APDL program prior to spur gear model development. The finite element analysis was carried out using ANSYS 15. The Finite Element Method (FEM) was comparatively an easy and accurate technique for analysing the nonlinear gear contact stresses. Frictional coefficients ranging from 0.0 until 0.3 were selected and the corresponding contact stresses were found to be directly proportional to the friction coefficients. A governing equation for the relationship between the dimensionless contact stress values and gear tooth depth ratios for varying friction coefficients was established. The results showed that the maximum stress was located beneath the surface of the gear tooth in contact for low friction coefficient values, Î¼ < 0.23. The stress trend remains the same for Î¼ > 0.23 but the surface stress becomes greater than the stresses beneath the surface. Furthermore, the position of maximum stress along the depth of contact was unchanged regardless of the amount of torque applied and frictional coefficient values.

Isolates from produced water in sulfate containing medium showed similarity with Desulfotomaculum, Desulfomicrobium and Thermodesulfobacterium genera. Similarly, isolates from produced water in nitrate containing medium were related to Tepidiphilus, Paenibacillaceae, Kocuria and Thauera genera. In the present study four sand packed bioreactors simulating moderately high temperature oil reservoir were used for different souring control treatments. Results revealed that continuous injection of 4 mM nitrate or 1.5 mM benzalkonium chloride (BAC) was not able to control souring. However, co-injection of 2 mM nitrate and 0.75 mM BAC completely ceased sulfide production and controlled souring.

One remarkable aspect of this study is that a new micro-convection model namely Patel model has been introduced in view of enhancement of thermal conductivity and hence more heat transfer capability of nanofluid. The non-linear partial differential equations have been converted into strong non-linear ordinary differential equations by employing suitable transformations and these transformed equations are solved by Runga-Kutta method of fourth order along with Shooting technique as well as Secant method for better approximation. From this study, it is found that the presence of magnetic field slows down the fluid motion while it enhances the fluid temperature leading to a reduction in heat transfer rate from the surface. It is also found that enhancing thermal radiation parameter causes a reduction in heat transfer rate.

India continues to be a key growth market among global corporates and this is reflective in the steady growth in demand for prime office space. A recent trend that has been noted is the increase in demand for office spaces not just in major cities but also in smaller tier II and Tier III cities. Growth in the commercial building sector projects a rising trend of energy intensive mechanical systems in office buildings in India. The air conditioning market in India is growing at 25% annually. This is due to the ever increasing demand to maintain thermal comfort in tropical regions. Air conditioning is one of the most energy intensive technologies which are used in buildings. As a result India is witnessing significant spike in energy demand and further widening the demand supply gap. Challenge in India is to identify passive measures in building envelope design in office buildings to reduce the cooling loads and conserve energy.

Inspired by multi-disciplinary progress and innovation in this direction, a thermo-fluid mechanical model is proposed to study the entropy generation and convective heat transfer of nanofluids fabricated by the dispersion of single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) nanoparticles in water as the base fluid. The regime studied comprises heat transfer and steady, viscous, incompressible flow, induced by metachronal wave propulsion due to beating cilia, through a cylindrical tube containing a sparse (i.e., high permeability) homogenous porous medium. The flow is of the creeping type and is restricted under the low Reynolds number and long wavelength approximations. Slip effects at the wall are incorporated and the generalized Darcy drag-force model is utilized to mimic porous media effects. Cilia boundary conditions for velocity components are employed to determine analytical solutions to the resulting non-dimensionalized boundary value problem. The influence of pertinent physical parameters on temperature, axial velocity, pressure rise and pressure gradient, entropy generation function, Bejan number and stream-line distributions are computed numerically. A comparative study between SWCNT-nanofluids and pure water is also computed. The computations demonstrate that axial flow is accelerated with increasing slip parameter and Darcy number and is greater for SWCNT-nanofluids than for pure water. Furthermore the size of the bolus for SWCNT-nanofluids is larger than that of the pure water. The study is applicable in designing and fabricating nanoscale and microfluidics devices, artificial cilia and biomimetic micro-pumps.

In first step, sequence homology-based genetic analysis of a set of 50 coding SNPs associated with 41 rsIDs using SIFT (Sorting Intolerant from Tolerant) and PROVEAN (Protein Variation Effect Analyzer) identified 23 nsSNPs to be putatively damaging/deleterious in at least one of the two tools used. Subsequently, structure-homology based PolyPhen-2 (Polymorphism Phenotyping) analysis predicted 9 of 23 nsSNPs (K4T, E31A, E31K, S41Y, I55N, P59L, P59S, L70P and V88D) to be damaging. According to the conditional hypothesis for the study, only nsSNPs that score damaging/deleterious prediction in both sequence and structural homology-based approach will be considered as \'high-confidence\' nsSNPs. In step 2, based on conservation of amino acid residues, stability analysis, structural superimposition, RSMD and docking analysis, the possible structural-functional relationship was ascertained for high-confidence nsSNPs. Finally, in a separate analysis (step 3), the IL-8 deregulation has also appeared to be an important prognostic marker for detection of patients with gastric and lung cancer.

The effects of power law index and viscosities on pressure across one wavelength, mechanical efficiency, and trapping are discussed numerically. It is found that the pressure required to restrain flowrates and the mechanical efficiency increase with the viscosities of the intermediate and peripheral layers as well as with the flow behaviour index.

Recently, several molecular genetic studies have provided multiple lines of evidence for a critical role of genetic factors in the expression of human bladder exstrophy-epispadias complex (BEEC). At this point, ISL1 (ISL LIM homeobox 1) has emerged as the major susceptibility gene for classic bladder exstrophy (CBE), in a multifactorial disease model. Here, GWAS (Genome wide association studies) discovery and replication studies, as well as the re-sequencing of ISL1, identified sequence variants (rs9291768, rs6874700, c.137C > G (p.Ala46Gly)) associated with CBE. Here, we aimed to determine the molecular and functional consequences of these sequence variants and estimate the dependence of ISL1 protein on other predicted candidates. We used: (i) computational analysis of conserved sequence motifs to perform an evolutionary conservation analysis, based on a Bayesian algorithm, and (ii) computational 3D structural modeling. Furthermore, we looked into long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) residing within the ISL1 region, aiming to predict their targets. Our analysis suggests that the ISL1 protein specific N-terminal LIM domain (which harbors the variant c.137C>G), limits its transcriptional ability, and might interfere with ISL1-estrogen receptor Î± interactions. In conclusion, our analysis provides further useful insights about the ISL1 gene, which is involved in the formation of the BEEC, and in the development of the urinary bladder.

These devices are considered as a part of the Low-power and Lossy Networks due to their use of low power embedded hardware and computationally constrained nature. For synchronization and utility, these devices are often clubbed together logically to form groups. To maintain data confidentiality within a group, a shared symmetric key called the Group Key (GK) is used by all the group members. The GK must be redistributed upon joining and leaving of a group member to maintain forward and backward secrecy. However, the key management (i.e., generation and distribution) process causes overhead which consumes the scarce network resources. In this paper, we propose TARE, a novel Topology Adaptive Re-kEying (TARE) scheme for lightweight and secure group communication. TARE integrates the principles of routing tree mapped logical key tree and local derivation of the key over the an IPv6 Routing Protocol for low-power and Lossy networks in an original way. TARE takes into consideration the current routing topology and makes maximum energy reduction as the premise for its choice of key derivation and distribution methods, thus, it reduces the network energy consumption while maintaining key secrecy and data confidentiality. In particular, TARE provides the following advantages: (1) lower network overhead and bandwidth utilization in key management and re-distribution operations, (2) effective against the network mobility in scalable IoT networks, (3) secure group communications in network against attacks such as man-in-the-middle and eavesdropping, and (4) data confidentiality by ensuring backward and forward secrecy in key distribution method. We evaluate the performance of TARE and compare it with existing schemes. Our results show the effectiveness of TARE regarding energy consumption, bandwidth utilization, and the number of encrypted message transmissions during the re-keying operations.

Features are classified by NTN and MNTN classifiers for speaker-dependent recognition and presented by using closed and open sets. The MNTN is evaluated for several speaker recognition experiments. These include closed- and open-set speaker identification and speaker verification. The MNTN is found to perform better than NTN classifier.

On the basis of the model, an algorithm is developed and implemented in MATLAB, PERL and HSPICE, to automatically generate the proposed model representation for a given nanocell. It is used to estimate the success_ratio as well as the nanocell reliability, while considering the uncertainties induced by transient errors.

Anti-oxidant capacity of CuNPs was determined using ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP), lipid peroxidation (LPO) and peroxidase assays, while the antiplatelet potential was determined by measuring two haemostatic parameters (PT & APTT assay). The minimum inhibitory concentration was observed at 60 Âµg/ml against Streptomyces griseus and Aspergillus Niger when NPs were prepared by method II. CuNPs prepared by the method I showed higher FRAP and LPO activities, while increased POX activity was found in CuNPs prepared by method II. CuNPs prepared using method I also showed better anti-oxidant and antiplatelet potential. It was observed that M. oleifera-derived CuNPs exhibits strong anti-microbial, anti-oxidant and APTT potential.

Three different layers i.e. the core layer, intermediate layer and peripheral layer are simulated with three different viscosities for each fluid layer. The unsteady two-dimensional conservation equations for mass and momentum with electrokinetic body forces, are transformed from the wave frame to the laboratory frame and the electrical field terms are rendered into electrical potential terms via the Poissonâ€“Boltzmann equation, Debye length approximation and ionic Nernstâ€“Planck equation. The dimensionless emerging linearized electrokinetic boundary value problem is solved using integral methods. Closed-form expressions are derived for stream functions in the core, intermediate and peripheral layers. Expressions are also derived for the coreâ€“intermediate interface shape and the intermediateâ€“peripheral interface shape. Maximum pressures are also computed. To study bolus migration, the range of the trapping limit is also determined in the peripheral layer. It is found that in the core layer larger boluses are computed in the case of lower intermediate layer viscosity relative to peripheral layer viscosity although the number of boluses is greater when the intermediate layer viscosity exceeds the peripheral layer viscosity. Furthermore, in the intermediate layer, stronger concentration of streamlines is computed in the lower half space with positive Helmholtzâ€“Smoluchowski velocity. Also negative Helmholtzâ€“Smoluchowski velocity reduces the core layer (H 1 ) interface shape whereas it enhances the peripheral layer (H) and intermediate layer (H 2 ) shapes. At lower values of volume flow rate ratio, hydromechanical efficiency is maximum for positive Helmholtzâ€“Smoluchowski velocity whether intermediate layer viscosity is less or greater than peripheral layer viscosity. Finally, greater with greater peristaltic wave amplitude and also for positive Helmholtzâ€“Smoluchowski velocity there is an increase in time-averaged flow rate, whether intermediate layer viscosity is less or greater than peripheral layer viscosity.

Bioremediation one of the important process of the above, degrades or transforms hazardous contaminants to less toxic compounds. Several groups of fungi have proved highly efficient in this aspect, with asbestos being one such toxic entity in the environment on which their activity was studied. The present investigation uses the same tool as a device for detoxifying asbestos, a potent carcinogenic entity; with fungal isolates native to the asbestos mines of Rajasthan, India, being investigated for the first time. The cellular mechanism of asbestos toxicity is mainly attributed to the presence of iron in its chemical composition which catalyzes generation of free radicals leading to oxidation of biomolecules. The two dominant novel species found therein, identified as Aspergillus tubingenesis and Coemansia reversa have proved capable of actively removing iron from asbestos fibers as studied by scanning electron microscopy- electron diffraction X-ray (SEM-EDX) analysis. This probably could lead to a reduction in toxicity of asbestos, due to reduced iron concentration as reported in related studies. Many fungi are known to release iron chelating compounds, siderophores, which could be instrumental in the study. The findings related to two new fungal species being added to the list of earlier identified fungal bioremediators of asbestos, widens the prospect of using bioremediation as an effective tool for asbestos detoxification.

Our aim is to replace SPICE simulation with our proposed surrogate models, which can be used to evaluate samples generated by sampling methods in variation space. Our methodology initiates by first characterizing the leakage of basic transistor stacks and then provides estimate of the leakage of basic gates based on these stacks. Transistor stacks are extracted across various standard cells, which are used to estimate leakage of CMOS gates with different input vector combinations. We develop Support Vector Machine (SVM) regression surrogate models and characterize the transistor stacks of CMOS gates, while accounting the combined effect of process variations in transistor length (L), threshold voltage (Vth), oxide thickness (Tox), supply voltage (0.6Vâˆ’1.2V), temperature (0Â°Câˆ’100Â°C) and width (28nmâˆ’200nm), all scalable at the same time. For gates containing parallel transistor stacks, we merge the parallel transistors having identical inputs, which in turn allows us to use precharacterized basic stacks for leakage calculation, thus avoiding generation of new models. Our experiments illustrate that we only require 30 and 26 stack models to predict the subthreshold and gate tunneling leakage of 20 different gates across 176 input combinations, instead of characterizing leakage model for each input vector separately. SVM regression models generated in our approach have the ability to predict the leakage with maximum average error of 2.7% in mean (Î¼) and maximum average error of 3.1% in standard deviation (Ïƒ), both for OAI22 gate. Our results establish that there is on an average 10Ã— improvement in runtime while estimating the Î¼ and Ïƒ of leakage of a gate within 10000 Monte Carlo simulation loop. Our approaches also result into a maximum of 221Ã— runtime improvement for C6288 ISCAS\'85 benchmark circuit. We further develop Sparse SVM models using Support Vector spectrum pruning method, which reduces the runtime of the regression models with negligible increase in the error. Runtime efficiency of 17Ã— and 323Ã— is achieved on standard cell library and C6288 benchmark circuit respectively using Sparse SVM models. Our models outperform previous models based on analytical equations and Artificial Neural Network in terms of accuracy.

Equal-valence-electron-density profiles and MP analysis suggest more ionic character of VB than that of TaB.

The effective elastic properties of the nanocomposite are computed by finite element method (FEM) based numerical homogenization technique. The obtained elastic properties of nanocomposite are utilized to investigate the buckling and post-buckling behaviour of different functionally graded (i.e., FG) nanocomposite plates modeled by varying the volume fraction of CNT/ESF along thickness direction, under in-plane compressive loads. The non-linear formulation is based on first-order shear deformation theory and von Karman\'s assumptions. It is found that considering the interphase between CNT and Mg matrix would result in decrease in buckling load and postbuckling strength of FG-CNT-reinforced nanocomposite plate as compared to nanocomposite without interphase.

One such technique, for opening of energy gap in graphene, is by way of doping the pristine graphene with boron or nitrogen. Besides many important applications, to which B- and N-doped graphene has been put, the one very important for solving the global energy crisis is by way of its capacity for hydrogen storage. In this paper electronic structure of B- and N-doped graphene has been studied by using Density Functional Theory, as implemented in WIEN2K code. PBE-GGA (Perdewâ€“Burkeâ€“Ernzerhof 96) pseudo-potential is used for solving the Schrodinger equation in self-consistent manner and to account for the exchange and correlation effects through the use of Generalized Gradient Approximation. The band structure calculations reveal that whereas a band gap opens at the symmetry point K both for B- and N-doped graphene, the center of the gap (i.e., the Dirac point in pristine graphene) is shifted above the Fermi level by about 2.20Â eV for B-doped graphene, and shifted down the Fermi level by about the same amount for N-doped graphene, when the doping level was kept 25% in each case. The energy gap opened was found to be about 0.30Â eV for B-doped graphene and 0.45Â eV for N-doped graphene. The linear dispersion characteristics obtained at Dirac point for pristine graphene, almost vanish for B-/N-doped graphene, due to symmetry breaking and opening of energy gap. The band structure and Density of States of B-/N-doped graphene are found also to depend on the choice of cell parameters.

First-generation biomass-derived fuels such as bioethanol and biodiesel have already been competing with conventional fuels, assisted by legislation. This review paper assesses the feasibility of adapting and incorporating second-generation advanced biofuel production technology for the thermochemical conversion of biomass to produce alternative fuels. The conversion technologies considered here are pyrolysis and gasification, and their potential has been examined using techno-economic assessment (TEA). A brief overview of different business models that can be incorporated during TEA has also been discussed. Techno-economic assessment data help in determining costs of technologies if they are employed on a commercial scale, especially in terms of per unit cost of product.

In this paper, the contact and bending stresses of a misaligned spur gear pair were evaluated with and without friction by employing corresponding analytical methods and finite element method (FEM). Friction coefficient values of 0.1 to 0.3 were used to evaluate the effects of friction on contact and bending stress distribution of a spur gear pair with axial and angular misalignments. The stress concentration was found to be higher at the contact point and at the tooth root of the gear with the augmentation of the misalignment distance and angle. The maximum contact and bending stresses increased by 67.5% and 18.9%, respectively, when axial misalignments were subjected. Similarly, the maximum contact and bending stresses increased by 27.0% and 62.4%, respectively, for angular misalignments. Furthermore, the contact and bending stresses increased proportionally with the increasing coefficient of friction.

Mangrove forest structure in 10 locations on the northern and southern coasts of the Gulf of Kachchh were assessed using the line intercept transect method. Descriptions included density of young and mature age classes, tree heights, diameters at breast height (DBH) and aboveground biomass, along with seven significant environmental variables. Mature tree densities ranged from 350 to 1567Â ind.Â haâˆ’1, while average height and girth at breast height ranged from 1.0 to 6.8Â m and 3.0 to 137.0Â cm, respectively.

Among the canopy index classes, more trees were recorded in class â‰¤ 2Â cm. The regeneration density was greater than the recruitment class. This study indicates that the poor structural attributes of Avicennia marina Vierth. var. acutissima Stapf and Mold dominated mangroves are largely due to aridity induced by scarce and erratic rainfall and high soil and water salinities.

Loading parameters such as strain magnitude, frequency, cycles, and strain rate (depending on loading waveform) affect the new bone formation. In-vivo studies suggested an optimal and osteogenic range of strain magnitude, frequency, and cycles to elicit the maximum new bone response. Still, there is no consensus on the selection of loading waveform. Animal studies on bone adaptation considered sinusoidal, and non-sinusoidal (e.g., trapezoidal, sawtooth, and triangular) loading waveforms according to physiological loadings (e.g., walking, running, and jumping etc.) without considering the relative effect of these waveforms on the loading-induced mechanical environment. The present study attempts to bridge this gap. Accordingly, this work hypothesizes that bone being a biphasic material (solid and fluid phases) experiences the same strain distribution for the different loading waves of the same amplitude, however, other components of the mechanical environment such as pore-pressure and interstitial fluid motion regulating the bone adaptation may differ. An in-vivo cantilever bending study is selected to substantiate the hypothesis. A poroelastic model is used to estimate the pore pressure and fluid motion developed in mouse tibia subjected to the: (i) trapezoidal, (ii) sawtooth, and (iii) triangular bending waves. Furthermore, poroelastic response of pore-pressure and fluid motion induced by these loading waveforms are compared and analyzed. This work also investigates how bone loss associated alterations in the microstructural environment of cortical bone affect the canalicular fluid motion induced by these waveforms. Overall results may be useful in designing optimal biomechanical interventions such as physical exercises to improve the bone health.

It is seen that the change in the resonance condition of anomalous Rabi oscillations is drastic in Weyl semimetal and TI. The ABSS in Weyl semimetals is highly anisotropic, whereas it is isotropic in TI. In case of TI, it is the Chern number which plays a crucial role to produce substantial change in the ABSS.

Creeping flow is taken into account (inertial forces are small compared with viscous forces) i.e., Reynolds number is low (Re <1) and wavelength is also taken to be very large. The Buongiorno formulation for nanofluids is employed with an Oberbeck-Boussinesq approximation.

Granite samples were drilled by using three different grades of cemented carbides (possessing 5, 10 and 15% cobalt) based twist drill bits.

In this paper, a novel technique has been proposed for 8T SRAM to reduce leakage current at 45-nm technology node. Here, we have used three different reverse body biasing techniques to reduce the leakage power. The three techniques used are: clamping of NMOS diode, clamping of PMOS diode, and clamping of NMOS and PMOS diode. Out of the three techniques, leakage current in 8T SRAM was minimum using PMOS clamping diode as compared to other proposed techniques. The supply voltage has been varied from 0.5 to 0.85 V. The leakage current has been reduced by both NMOS and PMOS clamping techniques, but the results for PMOS and NMOS were high as compared to two but lower than that of SRAM cell. The leakage current improved by 3.3x using PMOS technique and 2.7x using NMOS technique at supply voltage of 0.5V. The static power has also been calculated and compared for the three techniques.

Almost 60%-80% of the children coming to pediatric and endocrinology outpatient department for the evaluation of short stature are still labeled as idiopathic. Objectives: The aim of this study is to identify various chromosomal alterations causing idiopathic short stature (ISS) and short stature with dysmorphic features not pertaining to known genetic syndromes. Materials and Methods: After exclusion of all nutritional, systemic, endocrine, and syndromic causes of short stature, 19 patients with height <2 standard deviation scores were subjected to chromosomal microarray (CMA) study using Affymetrix CytoScan 750K array and CMA Scanner 3000 platform. Results: We identified total 61 copy-number variant (CNV) and polymorphs (33 gains, 11 loss, and 17 gain-mosaics) not described as normal variants in database of genomic variations. We identified SHOX haploinsufficiency as a cause of short stature in two patients, whereas one patient was gain-mosaic for SHOX. All three had normal conventional karyotype. One of these patients also had deletion of PAX3, which could be the cause of both short stature and associated mild intellectual impairment in this patient. We also found a long noncoding RNA, namely, KIAA0125 and a pseudogene ADAM6 in 18 out of our 19 patients which might have a regulatory role. Conclusion: This study shows that CMA is a very promising tool for the identification of pathogenic CNVs in patients with ISS. It can also help to identify novel genes controlling height and can open up new insight into pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying ISS, and thus may help to unfold new therapeutic targets for treatment of this condition. The association of CNV having genes for long noncoding RNAs, such as KIAA0125 and pseudogene such as ADAM6 with ISS suggest that they may play a role in controlling the expression of height-related genes and it needs further investigations.

It is a well-known fact that in most of the real world applications related to WSNs, the deployment is random as manual deployment is not possible due to harsh environments and other complexities. Therefore, there is no prior knowledge about the position of the sensor nodes that are deployed to form a wireless sensor network. In order to overcome this aspect related to position estimate of sensor nodes various localization schemes and algorithms have been proposed. The schemes and algorithms proposed so far also offer advantages like optimal routing, energy conservation, security, topology control besides providing the accurate position estimation of deployed sensor nodes. This paper explicitly presents a survey on the existing learning and non-learning based algorithms that have special role in localization of sensor nodes for WSNs. Methods: Comparative analysis of prominent learning and non-learning based algorithms. The analysis is based in terms of physical measurement, accuracy, computation and hardware cost and energy efficiency. Result: Detailed reporting of learning and non-learning based algorithms with their sub-categories. The study and survey of various algorithms throw light on their applicability and use for WSNs.

For this purpose, a genetically-engineered myoglobin (Mb) mutant was created by incorporating redox-active 3-amino-L-tyrosine (NH2Tyr) into its active site, replacing the distal histidine (H64) with NH2Tyr. In peroxide-shunt assays, this variant exhibits an increased rate of turnover for thioanisole and benzaldehyde oxidation as compared to the wild-type (WT) Mb. Indeed, in the presence of excess hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a 9-fold and 81-fold increase in activity was observed over multiple turnovers for thioanisole sulfoxidation and benzoic acid formation, respectively. The increased oxidation activity in the H64NH2Tyr Mb mutant underlined the role of NH2Tyr in the distal active-site scaffold in peroxide activation. Kinetic, electrochemical, and EPR spectroscopic experiments were performed. On the basis of these studies, it is argued that the single NH2Tyr residue within the Mb variant simultaneously serves the role of the conserved His/Arg-pair within the distal pocket of horseradish peroxidase.

An analytical prediction model for determining the standard deviation of the final surface is developed in terms of the aforesaid scanning parameters using response surface methodology (RSM). Furthermore, the optimal scanning parameters are predicted after comparing two almost unexplored nature inspired algorithms i.e. Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) and Moth-Flame Optimization (MFO). Finally, two realistic non-trivial case studies are considered for validation of the proposed methodology. The result shows that the standard deviation of the final reverse engineered models significantly reduced by 21.6% and 13.77%.

The results of proposed approach are compared with well-known conventional clustering techniques such as K-means, KHM and fuzzy C-means along with different state-of-the-art clustering approaches. Two text-based benchmark datasets such as CACM and CISI are also used to test the performance of all clustering approaches. The proposed clustering approach gives better results in comparison with other clustering approaches as clear from both the experimental and statistical analyses.

We have taken a small step in this direction by treating the query as a question and classifying it with the best suited classification algorithm. In this paper, we have tried to find out that when a perfect-informer of the question (knowing what is asked) is provided as an input for classification algorithms like SVN, NaÃ¯ve Base, and decision tree, we want to observe their accuracy on the same data set of questions.

Firstly, the governing flow problem is described by continuity and momentum equations in the presence of electrokinetic forces in Cartesian coordinates, then long wavelength and low/zero Reynolds (â€œneglecting the inertial forcesâ€) approximations are applied to modify the governing flow problem. The resulting differential equations are solved analytically in order to obtain exact solutions for velocity profile whereas the numerical integration is carried out to analyze the pumping characteristics.

Polymers of karaya gum are ideal choice over synthetic ones because of its natural availability, cost effectiveness, non-hazardous nature, easy recovery, and physicochemical properties. Moreover, the tree is widely used in tribal populations for its indigenous remedies against various ailments like oligospermia, leucorrhoea, constipation, body swelling, throat infection, wound healing, etc. Biochemical analysis authenticates photophysical, photochemical as well as pharmacological uses, and validates ethnobotanical applications by tribal communities up to some extent. The main purpose of this review is to highlight the potential of Sterculia urens, based on its ethnobotanical uses, industrial potential and perspectives of conservation and sustainable management. A comprehensive survey of literature was done to further explore various growth constraints, conservation strategies, and wide industrial applications. Sterculia urens has embraced significant values in international trade market due to its exceptional properties. Also the presence of diverse bioactive compounds has made this plant of interest for scientific research. Owing to the wide range of commercial applications and lack of knowledge regarding the scientific gum tapping methods, the plant has been exploited extensively for its highly valued products, while the propagation in natural habitat has been declining over the past few years. Excessive consumption of karaya gum has resulted in critically low abundance and thus this plant is now considered as endangered plant species in some states of India. Keeping in view its endangered status, conservation, and mass scale production through biotechnological approaches are fruitful towards maintaining its biological abundance.

Among all, piezoelectric is emerging as a promising conversion transduction mechanism of energy harnessing for artificial nanoswimmer. In this context, in present work, an elastic flagellum of a nanoswimmer is modeled as a cantilever beam and a simulation study is done in COMSOL. The novel design of branched flagellum is conceived, modeled, and simulated. COMSOL simulation studies have been performed to compare the effect of primary and secondary branching in flagellum design in terms of stress and electric potential. Enhancement in stress and electric potential is observed approximately 20 and 15% on increasing secondary branching uniformly on the main structure of cantilever beam towards free end and keeping primary branches constant. An enhanced stress allows for larger efficiency of conversion mechanism and, therefore, it is concluded that branching of flagellum can be pivotal in increasing on-board harnessing of energy for propulsion of nanorobots.

The chlorophyll a polyphasic fluorescence rise kinetics OJIP, stomatal conductance and Chlorophyll Content Index (CCI) were measured after 15 and 30Â days of O 3 fumigation, as well as in control plants; biomass measurements were done only after 30Â days with and without fumigation. Analysis of the OJIP kinetics by the JIP-test led to the calculation of several photosynthetic parameters and the total Performance Index (PI total ). The decline of PI total under the 80Â ppb O 3 treatment was due to a lower density of reaction centres (RC/ABS), while the notable decline under the 120Â ppb treatment was found to be due both to a further decline of RC/ABS and to a pronounced lowering of the efficiency with which an electron can move from the reduced intersystem electron acceptors to the PSI end acceptors (Î´ Ro ). Stomatal conductance was affected by both treatments. Biomass was found to be affected by O 3 fumigation (for 30Â days), decreasing by 40% at 80Â ppb and by more than 70% under 120Â ppb. Our findings indicate that biomass decline is due both to the lowering of CCI and the lowering of photosynthetic efficiency parameters. They thus suggest that two simple, non-invasive and rapid methods, namely, the analysis of OJIP fluorescence transients and the measurement of CCI, can be used to screen the effect of elevated O 3 on biomass of canola plants.

However, experimental in vitro methods showed the transport of natural amino acids and antibiotics, among them ceftazidime. We used molecular dynamics simulations to reveal the importance of the physicochemical properties of ceftazidime in modulating the translocation through OccK8, proposing a structure-function relationship. As in general porins, the internal electric field favors the translocation of polar molecules by gainful energy compensation in the central constriction region. Importantly, the comparatively narrow OccK8 pore can undergo a substrate-induced expansion to accommodate relatively large-sized substrates.

The sector provides strong incentives for vertical integration due to economies of scope. However, it is evident from the literature that large integrated PPPs in railway systems are not feasible due to higher commercial risks. They also suffer from implicit cross subsidization since the railway infrastructure is capital intensive, common to multiple revenue sources, and fare box revenues are generally not sufficient to recover investments. This is being addressed by various unbundling approaches in recent PPPs. The common unbundling is between infrastructure, operations, and services.The objective of this research is to explore the potential of unbundling further and to come up with a framework that helps policy makers in taking macro level decisions on PPP structuring. The research disaggregates the railway system into over 40 \'elements\' wherein an element is the smallest unit that can be given to a party for execution. However this unbundling would result in significant horizontal and vertical interfaces between these elements.A sustainable PPP would need to limit the extent of interfaces due to transaction costs and risks. This can be achieved by bundling the elements horizontally and/or vertically into \'entities\' to extract the best value for a PPP. The governing principles would be scale economies (horizontal integration), scope economies (vertical integration), need for competition (horizontal disaggregation), level playing field, transactional transparency, and need for specialization (vertical disaggregation). Additional drivers would be appetite for investment, availability of competence and accountability for an entity. The findings of the research indicate that the entity formation is one of the most crucial aspects of a PPP in railways.A consequential critical area is managing the interfaces between entities, which are subject to transaction costs and risks. These should be carefully identified and addressed by well-designed contractual agreements and independent regulation.

As old engines (Euro III or earlier) produce more emissions and it will be difficult to entirely stop their usage especially in developing and underdeveloped nations, it is desired that appropriate emission reduction technologies are tested on such engines to analyze their feasibility and economical acceptability. While most such studies have been conducted on constant speed stationary engines and modern engines, this study tried to analyze the effectiveness of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system on a Euro-1, water-cooled, direct injection, variable speed, compression ignition (C.I.) engine in a laboratory setup in India. This was done by testing an electronic control unit (ECU)-controlled EGR valve running the engine on different speeds; with different torques, as also with varying EGR percentages. Then optimum value of EGR valve opening for each set of engine speed and torque was determined, that is, corresponding to minimum oxides of nitrogen (NOx). Optimum EGR valve position was programmatically fed, for each set of torque and engine speed (in RPM), into EGR ECU and then the engine was run at varying speeds and torques and the emissions were verified in the automated mode. It was found that using EGR, NOx emissions were substantially reduced (average 45% reduction), without significantly impacting the engine performance. However, smoke emission increased with EGR. In order to counter the adverse effects, additional emission reduction technologies should be used in tandem with EGR.

Recently, Hou & Quan (2011) have developed a progressive scheme for secret sharing. It is observed that shares generated by the scheme are free from pixel expansion problem, but shares are not fully secure. In this paper, a new progressive sharing algorithm based on logistic chaotic map has been proposed to overcome the said limitation of Hou (2011) scheme. The irregular outputs of the logistic map are used to encode a secret digital information carrying image. The performance of the algorithm in the scheme of Hou (2011) is critically analyzed and compared with new suggested scheme.

In this paper, an attempt has been made to investigate the underlying constraints of heat dissipation and subsequently using LEDs as a general light source. The investigation is carried out in two steps. Firstly, the degradation in light output with corresponding increase in ambient temperature is explored. Secondly, the impact of increase in T-point temperature on the lifetime of the LEDs is observed. The experiment is conducted using high power LEDs and the same is subjected to external thermal stress. The temperature inside the environmental chamber represents the ambient temperature for the LED and thus by gradually increasing the ambient temperature the T-point temperature is also increased. The temperature of the chamber and the T-point are measured by using k-type thermocouple. The corresponding data hence obtained are tabulated and correlated with light output.

Recent research efforts have shown that dynamic and cyclic loading may effectively prevent or reverse bone resorption as loading enhances osteogenesis. Loading-induced canalicular fluid flow in bone is considered as a potential stimulus of new bone formation. It is believed that poroelastic material properties such as porosity and permeability typically decide fluid flow in canalicular spaces of bone. Accordingly, the authors hypothesized that changes in poroelastic material properties with age may affect the fluid flow, which in turn affects the new bone response against any external mechanical stimulation. This work attempts to relate the age-related changes in poroelastic material properties to fluid-flow distribution in lacuna-canalicular spaces of bone. The outcomes may be useful in the development of effective strategies to enhance the canalicular fluid flow, so that optimal exercises or sports activities can be designed to prevent or reverse the age-related bone loss.

The nanofluid sheet is extended with a linear velocity in the axial direction. The Buonjiornio model is utilized which features Brownian motion and thermophoresis effects. The partial differential equations for mass, momentum, energy and species (nano-particle concentration) are formulated with magnetic body force term. Viscous and Joule dissipation effects are neglected.

Graphical solutions for velocity, temperature, concentration field, skin friction and Nusselt number are presented. Furthermore stream function plots are also included.

Here we proposed a technique through which the computation of horizontal and vertical projection at each granularity level becomes fast and efficient by using vertical and horizontal integral image. If sample image is 90 by 90 sized by FS technique at granularity level 3, 62100 addition (+) operations are required to find 85 division points while in our proposed technique only 18000 addition (+) operations are enough to compute same features. So the computation time of foreground subsampling technique is reduced 3 times. Our database (handwritten Devanagari numerals) is given by ISI (Indian Statistical Institute), Kolkata.

This paper establishes an efficient technique called ARSkNN for finding out class of any given instance using a measure based on an unique similarity, that does no longer compute distance, for k-NN classification.

The PS was thermally annealed from 200Â°C to 800Â°C for 1 hr in the presence of air. It was shown that the pore diameter and porosity of PS vary with annealing temperature. The experimentally obtained adsorption / desorption isotherms show hysteresis typical for capillary condensation in porous materials. A simulation study based on Saam and Cole model was performed and compared with experimentally observed sorption isotherms to study the physics behind of hysteresis formation. We discuss the shape of the hysteresis loops in the framework of the morphology of the layers. The different behavior of adsorption and desorption of nitrogen in PS with pore diameter was discussed in terms of concave menisci formation inside the pore space, which was shown to related with the induced pressure in varying the pore diameter from 7.2 nm to 3.4 nm.

In this paper, we propose a novel Mobility Aware Cross-layer Routing approach for Peer-to-Peer Networks (MACARON) over MANET. MACARON provides reliable communication and high lifetime routes to support efficient data transmission in the network. For this purpose, it uses cross-layer communications to share routing updates between MANET and overlay routing protocols. MACARON provides guaranteed routes with low path stretch by maintaining OËœ(n) routing entries per node, where n is the number of nodes in the network. It provides scalability without using any landmark directory to store routing state, and it can effectively handle moderate mobility by using Last Encounter Routing (LER) protocol.

The nanocrystalline nature of PMMA is seen to be preserved in the blends although there are clear indications of bond modifications. The addition of PCTFE results in the improvement of overall crystallinity of the films via the interaction among PMMA and degraded PCTFE molecules when the films are casted from diluted solutions. In agreement, corresponding disorder in terms of Urbach energy shows a decreasing trend upon inclusion of more and more PCTFE molecules. Micro-Raman spectra are dominated by fluorescence background, which is proposed as arising from degraded PCTFE. Supporting this, FTIR spectra also shows modifications in bonding as a function of PCTFE percentage, but this bond modification is not enough to produce refractive index variation in the sample, which is dominated by the host PMMA contribution for all the PCTFE concentrations. The study suggests the useful range of PCTFE concentration in which PMMA host properties can be modified for optimizing optical and structural properties without much degradation of PCTFE.

The present data exhibit a decrease in the ratio of orbital to spin moments from 43.9% to 35.0% (while going from 6 to 300 K). First-principles calculations within DFT + U scheme have also been performed to confirm the spin-, orbital- and site specific-magnetic moments in TbCo2. An antiparallel exchange coupling between the Tb-4f and Co spin moments is found. The orbital moment is found to have a parallel coupling with the Tb spin moment, as evident from the experimental MCPs. From first-principles data it is seen that the orbital moments of Tb and Co sites are antiparallel to each other, as in the case of their spin magnetic moments. The present experimental study also shows an existence of an itinerant moment which is coupled ferromagnetically with the Tb-4f spin moment. Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this type of wireless network, any node can leave or join network at any movement. Besides it this type of networks have some other challenging characteristics as regularly changing topology, high mobility, narrow bandwidth. Conventional routing protocols focused on finding shortest path rather than Quality of Service path. Link breakage is the main reason of high mobility as well as lack of energy of wireless nodes. In the lack of resources, traffic density leads to congestion. So, the performance of routing protocol degrades in this type of networks. But it is not so easy task to take multiple QoS parameters for finding optimal route. Mobile software agent technology with unique features like mobility, autonomous, intelligent and adaptability can solve this problem. This research paper focuses on designing routing model using mobile agent paradigm. The proposed model attempts to find more optimal path by considering multiple QoS parameters like stability, delay, congestion and energy of the node. Simulation is done using Matlab simulator the simulation output shows that our proposed model is more reliable than traditional hop by hop AODV for finding the route from source node to destination node.

In this article we therefore investigate analytically the unsteady viscous flow driven by the combined effects of peristalsis and electro-osmosis through microchannel.

Closed-form solutions are derived for the non-dimensional boundary value problem. The computations demonstrate that magnitude of electric potential function is increased with a decrease in the thickness of the electrical double layer (EDL). Stronger electric field also decelerates the flow and decreases local wall shear stress. Hydrodynamic pressure is increased with EDL thickness whereas it is suppressed with electric field.

This energy, which accounts for nearly 35% - 40% of the total cost of production of the metal, is primarily in the form of Direct Current (DC) power. DC Power is used in the process of electrolysis to convert Alumina (Aluminium Oxide) to Aluminium.

In other words, it gives a linearized order of graph nodes describing the relationship between the graph vertices. Many applications of various fields in computer science require a constraint-based ordering of tasks and, thus, topological sorting holds a big place of importance for many applications like semantic analysis in compiler design, Gantt chart generation in software project management and many more. In this paper, a parallel version of this ordering algorithm over CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) has been discussed by identifying an approach to process-independent portions of the graph simultaneously for load flow analysis over radial distribution networks. The serial implementation of topological sort has been first discussed followed by its implementation on thread-block architecture of CUDA modifying the serial algorithm. Finally, the efficiency of this parallel version of topo sort has been investigated on various structures of graph modeled from radial distribution networks and has been reported.

The advantage of this ranking algorithm is that two dependent tasks are assigned to the same machine and as a result the scheduled length is reduced. The task selection phase selects a ready task from each workflow and creates a task pool. The resource selection phase initially assigns tasks using min-min heuristic, after initial assignment, tasks are moved from the highly loaded machines to the lightly loaded machines. Our resource selection algorithm increases the load balance among the resources due to tasks assignment heuristic and reassignment of tasks from the highly loaded machines. The simulation results show that our proposed scheduling algorithm performs better over existing approaches in terms of load balance, makespan and turnaround time. Â© 2018 Slovak Academy of Sciences.

Additionally, due to the presence of artifacts and variation in skin texture and smooth lesion boundaries, the accuracy of such methods gets hampered. The objective of this research is to develop an automated hair detection and lesion segmentation algorithm using lesion-specific properties to improve the accuracy. The aforementioned objective is achieved in two ways. Firstly, a novel hair detection algorithm is designed by considering the properties of dermoscopic hair. Second, a novel chroma-based geometric deformable model is used to effectively differentiate the lesion from the surrounding skin. The speed function incorporates the chrominance properties of the lesion to stop evolution at the lesion boundary. Automatic initialization of the initial contour and chrominance-based speed function aids in providing robust and flexible segmentation. The proposed approach is tested on 200 images from PH2 and 900 images from ISBI 2016 datasets. Average accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and overlap scores of 93.4, 87.6, 95.3, and 11.52% respectively are obtained for the PH2 dataset.

For example, the breakdown of controller could disrupt the data communication in the whole SDN network. A possible way to perform DoS is to generate a large number of new, but short length traffic flows. These flows will trigger malicious flooding requests to overload the controller and causes overflow in flow tables at SDN switches. In this paper, we propose two lightweight and practically feasible countermeasures against two different types of DDoS attacks called Route Spoofing and Resource Exhaustion in SDN networks. For Route Spoofing attack, we introduce a technique called â€œselective blockingâ€, which stops an adversary node from maliciously using other users active communication routes. To countermeasure Resource Exhaustion attack, we propose a solution called â€œperiodic monitoringâ€, which detects adversary nodes based on the traffic analysis statistics that are gathered within a time window. We implement and perform result analysis of the attacks and their proposed countermeasures. When using our proposed countermeasures in the target SDN scenarios, the simulation results indicate an adequate reduction in bandwidth consumption and processing delay of new request, and it also depicts substantial gain in packet delivery rate. Additionally, we present the receiver operating characteristic curve, which shows the sensitivity and specificity of our countermeasures along with their detection accuracy.

Most of the work reported on analog chaotic communication is based on the pioneer work of Pecora and Caroll, with synchronization between transmitter and receiver. Receiver based on synchronization, also known as coherent receiver, has a disadvantage of parameter mismatch and is sensitive to noise. In the present work, firstly, a secure transmitter using chaotic DC-DC converters is proposed that encrypts information using chaotic switching map technique. In chaotic switching map technique, the message is encrypted by randomly switching from one chaotic converter to another. The bifurcation parameter of the randomly switched chaotic converter is modulated by the message. Secondly, an attempt has been made to design a robust non-coherent receiver that is adaptable to the switching chaotic transmitters, even in the presence of noise. Once the receiver identifies the chaotic converter, it can decode the message as per the decryption algorithm. With the proposed non-coherent receiver, the disadvantages of coherent receivers can be overcome. We have also devised a prototype smart meter, used in smart distribution grid for implementing the proposed communication technique. Copyright Â© 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Changes in surge distances are facilitated by predefining number of steps and different wheel speeds which varies from 0.5v to 2.5v where v is 0.3605 m/s in real scenario. Robot with a predefined wheel speed takes minimum one step and maximum up to six steps after which the environmental conditions change. For a single step and a predefined wheel speed, 100 simulations were performed. There are five different wheel speeds to be tested for a step size hence 500 simulations are recorded. So with different combinations of step size varying from one to six with five different wheel speeds produces 3000 simulations. Results are compiled on the basis of elapsed time, distance covered as well as the success rate of robot if it takes the predefined steps and wheel speed for completion of said task.

In silico models assumed normal strain as the stimulus to predict the sites of new bone formation. These models, however, may fail to fit the amount of newly formed bone. Loading parameters such as strain, frequency, and loading cycle decide the amount of new bone formation. The models did not incorporate this information. In fact, there is no unifying relationship to quantify the amount of new bone formation as a function of loading parameters. Therefore, the present work aims to establish an empirical relationship between loading parameters and a new bone formation parameter i.e. mineral apposition rate (MAR). A neural network model is used to serve the purpose. Loading parameters are supplied as input, whereas, MAR served as output. The model is trained and tested with experimental data. The model establishes an empirical relationship to estimate MAR as a function of loading parameters. The model\'s predictions of MAR align with in vivo experimental results. The model\'s response is analyzed which indicates that the bone adaptation characteristics are successfully captured in the relationship. The relationship established may be incorporated further to improve qualitative and quantitative prediction capabilities of computer models. These findings can be extended in future to design and develop effective biomechanical strategies such as prophylactic exercise to cure bone loss.

Methods The governing equations are reduced in linear form using dimensional analysis and considering the low Reynolds number and large wavelength approximations. The time dependent temperature field, axial velocity, transverse velocity and pressure difference are obtained analytically in closed form solution. Trapping phenomenon is also discussed with the help of contour plots of stream function. A comparative study of pure water (Newtonian fluid), Copper water nanofluids and Silver water nanofluids under the influence of relevant physical parameters is made in graphical form and also discussed. The effects of absorption parameter and Grashof number on velocity profiles, temperature profiles and pressure distribution along the length of channel are examined. Results conclusions The computational results reveal that the velocity profile is maximum for Silver water nanofluids however, it is least for Copper water nanofluids. It is also concluded the temperature profile is more for pure water in comparison to Silver water and Copper water nanofluids.

The study simulates the bio-inspired pumping of electroconductive rheological polymers which possess both electroconductive and viscoelastic properties. The Jeffrey viscoelastic model is utilized which features both relaxation and retardation terms of relevance to real polymers. A magnetic body force is incorporated for the influence of static radial magnetic field. The mass and momentum conservation equations are formulated in an intrinsic coordinate system and transformed with appropriate variables into a nondimensional system between the wave and the laboratory frames, under lubrication (i.e., low Reynolds number and long wavelength) approximations. Kinematic and no-slip boundary conditions are imposed at the channel walls. A magnetic body force is incorporated for the influence of static radial magnetic field in the primary momentum equation. An analytic approach is employed to determine closed-form solutions for stream function, axial pressure gradient, and volumetric flow rate. Spatiotemporal plots for pressure distribution along the channel (passage) length are presented to study the influences of curvature parameter, relaxation-to-retardation time ratio (Jeffrey first viscoelastic parameter) and Hartmann number (magnetic field parameter). The effects of these parameters on radial velocity distributions are also visualized. Cases of trapping and reflux in a curved channel are discussed. Streamline distributions are included to study trapping phenomena and to investigate more closely the impact of curvature, magnetic field, and viscoelastic properties on bolus evolution. The reflux or retrograde motion of the particles is studied by particle advection based on Lagrangian viewpoint.

In reality different land covers within a pixel can be found due to continuum of variation in landscape and intrinsic mixed nature of most classes. Mixed pixels may not be appropriately processed by traditional image classifiers, which assume that pixels are pure. The existence of mixed pixels led to the development of several approaches for soft (often termed fuzzy in the remote sensing literature) classification in which each pixel is allocated to all classes in varying proportions. However, while the proportions of each land cover within each pixel may be predicted, the spatial location of each land cover within each pixel is not. Thus, it is important to develop and implement a classifier that can work as soft classifiers for landslide identification.

To improve the spectral properties of spectral indices for specific class identification (in this case landslide) a Class Based Sensor Independent (CBSI) technique proposed.

This paper is addressed the problem of vehicle parking for small scale by using the surveillance camera. A background subtraction is used to detect moving vehicle. The moving vehicles are tracked using the Gaussian mixture model and a foreground mask is created. Dilation is applied to remove inconsistent and noise particles. The variable intensity distribution is plotted on a histogram and changes are identified to count vehicles. Each parking spot can accommodate only certain numbers of vehicle. If the count has reached the maximum limit then the display unit guides the driver to next available parking spot.

Findings - The influence of emerging physical flow parameters on fluid velocity component, temperature distribution and nanoparticle concentration are discussed in detail. Also, anOHAM solution demonstrates very good correlation with those obtained in the previously published results. It is noticed that OHAM can overcome the earlier restriction, assumptions and limitation of traditional perturbation method. The main advantage of this method is that OHAM can be applied directly to nonlinear differential equations without using linearization and round-off errors, and therefore, it cannot be affected by error associated to discretization.

Asbestos a naturally occurring fibrous mineral declared a Group I definite carcinogen by IARC (International Agency for Research on Cancer), a unit of WHO in the year 1987, has been extensively used since World War II to the near past for various commercial products. According to the most recent World Health Organization (WHO) estimates, asbestos-related diseases, resulting from exposure at workplace claims more than 107000 lives every year worldwide. The various types of toxic effects induced by asbestos in humans include - i) inflammation and fibrogenesis of lung, ii) mesothelioma iii) asbestosis and iv) bronchogenic carcinoma. The stability of asbestos in natural environment and its biological aggressiveness is related to their fibrous structure and dimensions. The actual risk associated with the exposure to nanosized asbestos, which is still unknown and escapes most regulations worldwide, has been shown in various toxicity assessment studies conducted on various animal models.In an effort to reduce the size of asbestos and therby its toxicity by limiting its biopersistence, oxalic acid treatment of asbestos coupled to power ultrasound treatment was carried out. The nanosized particles formed were still found to retain their hazardous effect. Similar were the results obtained on strong acid treatment of asbestos as well. A probable solution to the asbestos toxicity problem therefore envisaged was bioremediation. This involved the secretion of iron chelating molecules termed siderophores by microbes, which are of significance due to their ability to form very stable and soluble complexes with iron. Iron in asbestos composition is a major factor responsible for its carcinogenicity, removal or extraction of which would prove to be an effective answer to the worldwide problem. Siderophores are low molecular weight organic compounds with a very high and specific affinity to chelate iron and enhance their diffusion to the microbial cell surface. A number of successful experiments carried out in vitro have shown positive results concerning reduction in asbestos toxicity on chelation of iron by siderophores. The present investigation tends to put forth the aspect of these biomolecules secreted by specific bacteria and fungi as potent tools to fight the micro to nano sized asbestos fibre toxicity.

Available inorganic and organic chemicals used in commercial sunscreen have deleterious activity in vivo. Therefore, there is a need of a safe and natural sunscreen. Cyanobacteria are the impressive source of natural products and they can be exploited industrially. Cyanobacteria synthesize the UV absorbing compounds like mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) and scytonemin. MAAs are water-soluble molecules (188 to 1050 Da) that absorb UV-A and UV-B radiation and disperse the energy as heat. Scytonemin is a lipid soluble pigment (544 Da) having absorption maxima at 380 nm. They are promising natural alternatives for both direct (UV-absorption) and indirect (antioxidant) protection. These molecules show strong photostability and do not have any cytotoxic effects. The search for natural UV protective molecules is relatively recent, providing two commercial products (Helioguard(r) and Helionori(r)) containing MAAs extract from red alga Porphyra umbilicalis. Still commercialization of potential photoprotective molecules is required for the development of a better and safe sunscreen. Therefore, for improvement in their expression levels, a complete understanding of biosynthetic pathway of MAAs and scytonemin is essential. Additionally, an economic and sustainable method for extraction of these molecules from cyanobacteria is also required for large-scale production. Future perspectives include the heterologous expression of MAAs and/or scytonemin in industrially friendly microorganisms in order to co-produce different UV protective molecules and thus cover a broader UV spectrum and simplify the production process.

Thus, it provides logically centralized visibility of the entire networking infrastructure to the controller. It enables the applications running on top of the control plane to innovate through network management and programmability. To envision the centralized control and visibility, the controller needs to discover the networking topology of the entire SDN infrastructure. However, discovering and maintaining a global view of the underlying network topology is a challenging task because of (i) frequently changing network topology caused by migration of the virtual machines in the data centers, mobile, end hosts and change in the number of data plane switches because of technical faults or network upgrade; (ii) lack of authentication mechanisms and scarcity in SDN standards; and (iii) availability of security solutions during topology discovery process. To this end, the aim of this paper is threefold. First, we investigate the working methodologies used to achieve global view by different SDN controllers, specifically, POX, Ryu, OpenDaylight, Floodlight, Beacon, ONOS, and HPEVAN. Second, we identify vulnerabilities that affect the topology discovery process in the above controller implementation. In particular, we provide a detailed analysis of the threats namely link layer discovery protocol (LLDP) poisoning, LLDP flooding, and LLDP replay attack concerning these controllers. Finally, to countermeasure the identified risks, we propose a novel mechanism called TILAK which generates random MAC destination addresses for LLDP packets and use this randomness to create a flow entry for the LLDP packets. It is a periodic process to prevent LLDP packet-based attacks that are caused only because of lack of verification of source authentication and integrity of LLDP packets. The implementation results for TILAK confirm that it covers targeted threats with lower resource penalty.

However, multimedia applications also require provisioning of adequate quality of service (QoS) to enhance quality of experience (QoE) of end users. In order to provide QoS in a network, the accurate knowledge of the remaining network resources at any time is the key. But, due to the inherent characteristics of MANETs such as dynamic topology, high bit-error-rate communication channels, and decentralized control, estimating remaining network resources is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel remaining bandwidth estimation algorithm which considers the node (or link) mobility into consideration while performing dynamic bandwidth estimation on a node. The estimated link bandwidth value is then used during the route discovery process to select routes with adequate bandwidth and thus increases the QoS of the data flow. The proposed algorithm is verified using real-time video traffic (i.e., H.264/SVC encoded video traces) using a industry standard simulator called Qualnet. The simulation results show that the proposed approach increases the decision accuracy of the soft admission control process and thus leads to the enhancement of the quality of the received video traffic.

The numerical results accomplished in the present study are validated and felt to be in good agreement with the previously published results. The numerical computations reveal that that the Lorentz force due to presence of magnetic field impinges its resistance on fluid motion and enhances the thermal resistance.

In this study, a latent heat thermal energy storage system (LHTESS) for stationary C.I. engine exhaust heat was developed and integrated with engine. A shell and tube type heat exchanger having 346 mm diameter and 420 mm height with 45 numbers of tubes with 18 mm diameter was developed to store thermal energy, in which Erythritol (C4H10O4) was used as a phase change material. The engine performance and the thermal energy storage system performance parameters such as amount of heat stored, and charging efficiency were evaluated. Slight decrease in the engine performance was observed when latent heat thermal energy storage system was integrated to engine but amount of energy which could be recovered was significant. At a load of 4.4 kW the maximum charging efficiency, recovery efficiency and percentage energy saved was 69.53\\%, 38\\% and 11.33\\% respectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Additionally, the huge amount of data generated by these devices posses new challenges concerning tasks such as efficient information acquisition and analysis, decision making, and action implementation. In this paper, we propose CENSOR, a novel cloud-enabled secure IoT network architecture based on SDN paradigm. We discuss the significant benefits as well as challenges that are inherent while performing integration of SDN and IoT in CENSOR. We show that the emerging software-based networking features combined with the cloud computing solutions can significantly improve the security and communication reliability in the target IoT scenarios. In particular, to provide the adequate security measures in the network, CENSOR uses a lightweight and scalable software remote attestation scheme, which ensures the integrity of the software that is being executed by the IoT devices to achieve the application specific goals in the network. We further discuss the improvements in data communication and data overhead that can be achieved in CENSOR due to its convergence with the cloud computing (at back-end) and fog computing services (at edge routers or front-end). A Smart City use-case has been considered as a target IoT scenario to analyze the feasibility and effectiveness of CENSOR concerning the communication security and the network scalability parameters. Additionally, we provide future research directions along with the recent industry initiatives that include open issues in the integration and deployment of cloud-enabled SDN-based IoT networks.

The first six cycles of synchronously sampled post-fault data measurements from PMUs consisting of rotor angles and voltages of generators are taken as the input to the neural network to predict the future state of the system.

Herein, an Imidazopyrimidine Dye, named, 4-amino-3-(phenyldiazenyl)benzo {[}4,5] imidazo {[}1,2-a] pyrimidin-2(1H)-one, (APIP) has been used as a copper corrosion inhibitor in 3.5 wt.\\% (by weight) NaCl solution.

Potentiodynamic polarization (PDP) results confirmed that the APIP can suppress copper corrosion effectively at low concentration in 3.5 wt.\\% NaCl solution with an inhibition efficiency of 92.79\\% due to adsorption, along with the prediction of electrochemical mechanism. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements showed that the corrosion inhibition of Cu proceeds via both diffusion and kinetic controlled processes.

Homogeneous Reactor model (HRM) was utilized to compute the combustion parameters for a single cylinder diesel engine with unit aspect ratio and capacity of one-litre. The rate of pressure rise has a significant influence on the peak pressure generated, power produced and the degree of smooth transmittance of forces to the piston during the power stroke. The rate of pressure rise can be defined in terms of the crank angle increments since crank angle displacement is an indication of the engine speed. The pressure rise with respect to the crank angle increments were calculated based on three factors namely compression ratio, injection time and boost pressure that were selected for analysis of the diesel engine combustion at three significant levels. A L9 array was used to analyse the response of pressure-crank angle gradient \"dp/dÎ¸\" as the output variable. From the Taguchi analysis of the effect of the three parameters, injection timing was the most dominant factor for the rise in the pressure gradient followed by boost pressure ratio and compression ratio as the lowest dominant factors. A contour of dp/dÎ¸ showed injection timing of 12Â° BTDC as the most optimum timing for maximum rise in pressure.

These tires have been proved to be a malady on the environment causing severe pollution and health hazards. Hence, the potential use of end-of-life tires has been crucial, especially due to the uncontrolled population rise in urban areas which demands construction on undesirable soil. This paper examines the loadâ€“deformation behaviour of rubber fibreâ€“reinforced cemented clayey soil through laboratory tests such as unconfined compressive strength (UCS) and split tensile strength (STS) tests. The clayey soil was stabilised with 3 and 6% cement content, and the inclusion level of rubber fibres was kept at 0, 2.5, 5, 7.5 and 10%. A total of 360 specimens, 180 specimens each for the UCS and STS tests, were prepared in accordance with their optimum moisture content and maximum dry unit weight and cured for 7, 14 and 28Â days. The study revealed that adding rubber fibres (up to 2.5%) to clayey soil leads to marginal improvement in UCS and STS. Note that by inclusion of rubber fibres to cemented clayey soil causes a decrease of UCS and STS. Maximum increase of absolute toughness and toughness index of cemented clayey soil was observed with the addition of 7.5% rubber fibres. Test results showed that inspite of the decrease in UCS and STS of cemented clayey soil with the augmentation of rubber fibre content, there were decreases in initial stiffness and improvements on ductility and hardening in the post-peak region. From this study, it could be concluded that rubber fibres up to 7.5% can be incorporated in the cemented clayey soil.

Data sharing in this form calls for the need of high bandwidth consumption which may slow down the network resulting in performance degradation of content delivery networks due to congestion. Several attempts have been made by the researchers to propose various techniques and algorithms to achieve optimal performance of the network resources under high-usage circumstances. But due to high-dense network architectures, the performance implementations of suggested algorithms for congestion may not be able to produce the desired results in real time. In this paper, we have presented an optimized multi-core architecture-based parallel version of two congestion control algorithmsâ€”leaky bucket and choke packet. The experimental results over a dense network show that optimized parallel implementation using OpenMP programming specification gets the network rebalancing in a very short span of time as compared to its serial counterpart. The proposed approach runs 60% faster than the serial implementation. The graphical map for the speed up continues to increase with the size of the network and routers.

The reason can be attributed mainly to the enhanced lifetime and less energy consumption as compared to the other mentioned types. However one important aspect needs attention, the impact of driver on LEDs. LEDs are current controlled devices and hence emit maximum light with increase in current input to the device. This feature, boost up the light output but it increases the junction temperature of the device. Hence additional heat sinks are required to vent out the excessive heat generated due to increase current input to the LEDs. Those additional heat sinks are at times difficult to accommodate. So, designers have made arrangements to vent out the heat from the device. This is achieved by designing fins. However this arrangement is not suitable in places where the ambient temperature is more than normal. Thus, design of LED driver with controlled current input is essential in order to maintain the thermal limit of the device. Secondly, the AC-DC LEDs driver circuits, which are available in the market, are seldom equipped with input power factor and THD improvement circuitry as prescribed in IEC61000- 3-2. This is essential for maintaining the energy efficiency of the nearest utility services and in addition also improves on the current drawn by the device. The following work envisages these issues and proposes corrective driver circuit based on two different driver topologies, buck-boost topology and flyback topology. Both these topologies are proposed in order to address the aspects of power quality and its impact on the life of the device.

Therefore, securing communication among these devices is a key challenge for various sensitive applications. However, the conventional encryption and decryption algorithms, known as ciphers, cannot be implemented because of their inherent complexities of implementation and power requirements. One of the promising options available is to implement light-weight ciphers for these resource-constrained devices. Moreover, the choice of lightweight encryption tool has a great dependency on the type of IoT devices being used in an application. In this paper, a lightweight cellular automata (CA)-based cipher, named as Lightweight CA Cipher (LCC), has been proposed for IoT applications. In the proposed method, encryption is done at the perception layer, where the sensor nodes are deployed and decryption is done at the network layer where gateway devices are installed. The experimental results show that the proposed method is efficient than some of the existing ciphers like DES, 3DES when randomness, execution time, and implementation simplicity are considered as prime requirements. This cipher passes the randomness tests as prescribed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and it also passes all the DIEHARD tests and it establishes the security feature of LCC.

In the presence of low traffic, ALR switches link rate from 10 to 1Â Gbps depending on the particular threshold value of traffic load. In the presence of narrowband traffic, a significant amount of energy is saved. Proposed architecture also saves capital expenditure (CAPEX) at remote node and reduces significant CAPEX for larger networks. This architecture also provides network resiliency against LC/TRx or module failure and bandwidth scalability to support future generation PON architectures without any service interruption.

Most of the proposed mobile agent based schemes use static itineraries for agents\' migration that are computed at the sink using a centralized algorithm. These centralized algorithms require global knowledge of sensor distribution, which is difficult to obtain accurately. Other issue with static itinerary based agent migration is that an agent may not move along its itinerary due to node failures or malicious node attacks. In order to solve these issues, we first propose a framework for trust evaluation to identify the malicious behavior of sensor nodes and then give a localized distributed protocol, called energy and trust aware mobile agent migration (ETMAM) protocol for periodic data gathering application. The results of our simulation study show that the ETMAM protocol is effective in improving resilience against node failures or malicious nodes attacks. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Gum exudates of the tree are of immense medicinal importance due to their applications in biodegradable drug delivery systems and in treatment of asthma, dysentery and intestinal cancer. The multidimensional utilities of M. oleifera may cause overexploitation of this tree, posing danger to the existing natural variability in the near future. Therefore, there is a need for conservation of the species for ethnobotanical, pharmacological, nutraceutical and biodiversity purposes. Development of tissue culture propagation methods will assist in preserving some of the germplasm of the species. In the present review, consolidated analysis of the role of biotechnology in conservation and genetic enhancement of nutritional, medicinal and commercial value of the tree has been placed in perspective, together with an up to date review on phytochemical analysis of the plant, and its utility has been discussed to invite the attention of the scientific community to further consider the study of this miracle tree species and its nutritional and pharmaceutical properties.', '', '', 'ELSEVIER GMBH, URBAN & FISCHER VERLAG', '2210-8033', '', '', '', 'Journal', '', 'NO', 'SCI', 'NO', 'NO', '', 0, '', '2019-03-27 12:19:09', '26866NA2019-03-27 12:19:09', 'WEB'),

DF decreases with increasing prolate deformation even though the 2s-orbit is empty which shows the role of deformation in central depletion apart from the unoccupancy in s-orbit as is usually believed. As T increases, the occupancy of s-orbit increases, shell structure melts, the deformation vanishes and the weakening of central depletion is solely due to the temperature.

It is shown that the Chern number may be directly inferred by performing a pump-probe experiment in the bulk without referring to surface states. A simpler alternative to the Lindblad method is invoked in order to incorporate dephasing effects that despite leading to a non-unitary time evolution of the wave-function, is nevertheless, probability conserving. The differential transmission coefficient versus the pump pulse duration (when all else is held fixed) has the form of a sinusoidal function with an amplitude that decays as a power law in the pump duration (alternatively, the â€œareaâ€ of the pump pulse).

It is believed that myometrial contractions induced by peristaltic propulsion and pressure gradient typically regulate the intrauterine fluid movement. Several factors like changes in the mechanical behavior of uterus with age, hormonal variations, number of pregnancies, and mode of delivery (vaginal delivery versus cesarean), and any gestation may impair this mechanism. There are limited reports which indicate that the intrauterine fluid movement is possible to control with the help of external electric or magnetic fields. However, there are very few studies that investigate the intrauterine fluid motion in the presence of aforementioned external stimuli. This encouraged us to develop a computer model to study intrauterine fluid movement induced by peristalsis in the presence of electro-magnetohydrodynamics. Uterus geometry is idealized as a tapered micro-channel, whereas the Williamson fluid model is used to represent the intrauterine fluid. The Debye-HÃ¼ckel linearization and perturbation method are employed to obtain the mathematical solution for fluid motion in the presence of any external field. The effect of the Debye-HÃ¼ckel parameter, Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity, zeta potential and Hartmann number on pumping characteristics, flow characteristics, shear stress and trapping are studied to analyze the sensitivity of the fluid model. Overall, this study presents a model to understand the behavior of the intrauterine fluid motion in the presence of electric and magnetic fields. The model and associated results may be encouraged and may helpful for biomedical engineers in the design and development of such biomicrofluidic devices which can transport the embryo at a suitable location of the uterus for implantation.

It is therefore the cleanest possible, totally non-polluting fuel. This fact has led some people to propose an energy economy based entirely on hydrogen, in which hydrogen would replace gasoline, oil, natural gas, coal, and nuclear power. Hydrogen is a clean energy source. Therefore, in recent years, demand on hydrogen production has increased considerably. Electrolysis of water, steam reforming of hydrocarbons and auto-thermal processes are well-known methods for hydrogen gas production, but not cost-effective due to high energy requirements. As compare to chemical methods, biological production of hydrogen gas has significant advantages such as bio-photolysis of water by algae, dark and photo-fermentation of organic materials, usually carbohydrates by bacteria. New approach for bio-hydrogen production is dark and photo-fermentation process but with some major problems like dark and photo-fermentative hydrogen production is the raw material cost. By using suitable bio-process technologies hydrogen can be produced through carbohydrate rich, nitrogen deficient solid wastes such as cellulose and starch containing agricultural and food industry wastes and some food industry wastewaters such as cheese whey, olive mill and baker\'s yeast industry wastewaters. Utilization of aforementioned wastes for hydrogen production provides inexpensive energy generation with simultaneous waste treatment. This review article summarizes bio-hydrogen production from some waste materials with recent developments and relative advantages.

Ball-end milling experiments have been planned using central composite design based on response surface methodology. The mathematical models have been established and tested for adequacy. A full quadratic model has been adopted for modelling. It has been found that axial depth of cut is the most dominant cutting parameter for the tangential and axial cutting forces, accounting for 49.38 and 47.12% contributions, respectively. Radial depth of cut is the most dominant parameter for radial force and contributes 69.94% for it. Results also revealed that force components decrease with increase in cutting speed. There is very small variation in cutting force components in the cutting speed range of 75â€“150Â m/min at lower values of axial and radial depth of cut. Surface roughness is effected by cutting speed largely followed by feed. Multi-objective optimization has been performed using composite desirability to optimize the cutting parameters for minimum surface roughness and cutting forces simultaneously. Confirmation tests have been conducted using optimal set of cutting parameters. The results of confirmation tests are very close to the predicted results.

Fly ash samples exhibit an average HIRM value (400.07 Ã— 10âˆ’5Â Am2Â kgâˆ’1) that is comparable to that of soil samples. The pre- and post-monsoon samples show a consistent reduction in the concentration of magnetically â€œhardâ€ minerals with increasing distance from the power plant. These data suggest that fly ash has indeed been transported from the power plant to the sampling locations. Hence, HIRM may perhaps be used as a proxy for tracking fly ash from coal-fired thermal power plants. Seasonal data show that the distribution of fly ash to the surrounding areas is minimum during monsoons. They also point to the dominance of SP magnetite in early-monsoon season, whereas magnetic depletion is documented in the monsoon season. This seasonal difference is attributable to both pedogenesis and anthropogenic activity i.e. operation of the thermal power plant.

Deploying GPS receivers for each node would render network deployment cost for a dense network. The unavailability of GPS in indoor and underground environment has also put the installation of GPS into question. This makes the sensor nodes to identify its location coordinates or location reference without using GPS, and is achieved with the help of a special node that knows its location coordinates and protocols, called beacon node.

Findings: This study reveals that lack of management commitment, leadership and resources are the key barriers to lean implementation in SMEs in India. Furthermore, poor communication between different levels of the organisation and inadequate dissemination of the knowledge of lean benefits also creates hindrance in lean implementation. Managerial implications of the identified barriers for lean implementation in SMEs have been discussed. Originality/value: The research regarding lean implementation in SMEs is scarce.

The present study has been designed to utilize plant pathogenic fungi Sclerotinia sclerotiorum MTCC 8785 strain for synthesis and optimization of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) production as well as evaluation of antibacterial properties. The AgNPs were synthesized by reduction of aqueous silver nitrate (AgNO3) solution after incubation of 3â€“5Â days at room temperature. The AgNPs were further characterized using UVâ€“visible spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Reaction parameters including media, fungal biomass, AgNO3 concentration, pH and temperature were further optimized for rapid AgNPs production. The antibacterial efficacy of AgNPs was evaluated against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 by disc diffusion and growth kinetics assay at the concentration determined by the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Results: AgNPs synthesis was initially marked by the change in colour from pale white to brown and was confirmed by UVâ€“Vis spectroscopy. Optimization studies showed that potato dextrose broth (PDB) media, 10Â g of biomass, addition of 2Â mM AgNO3, pH 11 and 80Â Â°C temperature resulted in enhanced AgNPs synthesis through extracellular route. TEM data revealed spherical shape AgNPs with size in the range of 10Â nm. Presence of proteins capped to AgNPs was confirmed by FTIR. AgNPs showed antibacterial activity against E. coli and S. aureus at 100Â ppm concentration, corresponding MIC value. Conclusion: S. sclerotiorum MTCC 8785 mediated AgNPs was synthesized rapidly under optimized conditions, which showed antibacterial activity.

The sensor\'s response is studied toidentify linearity and repeatability, using which, reliability of data is determined. Further, appropriate Machine learning algorithms can be employed to classify different set of activities.

This will protract the lifetime of sensor networks. However, a cluster head has to perform various tasks such as collection of data from member nodes, aggregation of the collected data, and send that data to the BS. Network load balance is a challenging issue in WSNs for the clustering schemes. Genetic algorithms (GA) with clustering schemes are implemented for better cluster formation. The GA run through again over a large no of iterations to find the optimal solution that leads to premature convergence. The chaotic GA (CGA) will solve this problem by avoiding local convergence, i.e., by choosing a chaotic map to generate the random values instead of traditional random function and improves the performance of the traditional GA. A chaotic GA (CGA) based clustering algorithm for WSNs has been proposed in the proposed work that has better convergence rate for cluster head selection and consequently improves the performance of sensor network.

People who are not intended to be the recipients of the message should not even suspect that a hidden message exists. Text steganography is challenging as it is difficult to hide data in text without affecting the semantics. Retention of the semantics in the generated stego-text is crucial to minimize suspicion.This paper proposes a technique for text steganography using classical language Sanskrit. As Sanskrit is morphologically rich with a very large vocabulary, it is possible to modify the cover text without affecting the semantics. In addition numerical encoding is used to map a Sanskrit character to a numerical value. This helps in hiding the message effectively. Moreover, in this technique, a key is used for additional security. The key is generated dynamically and is appended to the final message to further add security to the proposed method. The proposed method generated stego-texts with syntactic correctness of 96.7%, semantic correctness of 86.6%, and with a suspicion factor of just 23.4% upon evaluation.

To simplify the Poisson Boltzmann equation, we also use the Debye-HÃ¼ckel linearization. We consider governing equation for micropolar fluid in absence of body force and couple effects however external electric field is employed. The solutions for axial velocity, spin velocity, flow rate, pressure rise, and stream functions subjected to given physical boundary conditions are computed.

However, we identified that the inherent features of ICN also causes new vulnerabilities in the network. In this paper, we first propose a novel attack called as Bitrate Oscillation Attack (BOA), which exploits fundamental ICN characteristics: in-network caching and interest aggregation, to disrupt DASH functionality. In particular, the proposed attack forces the bitrate and resolution of video received by the attacked client to oscillate with high frequency and high amplitude during the streaming process. To detect and mitigate BOA, we design and implement a reactive countermeasure called Fair-RTT-DAS. Our solution ensures efficient bandwidth utilisation and improves the user perceived Quality of Experience (QoE) in the presence of varying content source locations. For this purpose, Fair-RTT-DAS consider DASH\'s two significant features: round-trip-time (RTT) and throughput fairness. In the presence of BOA in a network, our simulation results show an increase in the annoyance factor in user\'s spatial dimension, i.e., increase in oscillation frequency and amplitude. The results also show that our countermeasure significantly alleviates these adverse effects and makes dynamic adaptive streaming friendly to ICN\'s implicit features.

To determine whether nanoparticles influence the displacement efficiency of the injected fluid, we used a blend of xanthan gum and nickel nanoparticles. We have evaluated the changes in the dilute solution viscosity of xanthan when the nickel nanoparticles are added and have found out that a xanthan-nickel nanoparticles mixture has a higher intrinsic viscosity of 55.25 dL/g compared to 49.13 dL/g for the gum solution. Efficiency of nanoparticle assisted polymer flooding was evaluated in sand packed bioreactors with âˆ¼0.6 PV of residual oil in place (ROIP). Flooding results demonstrated the highest recovery of 5.98% of additional ROIP with xanthan-nickel nanoparticle mixture compared to 4.48 and 4.58% of ROIP during the separate flooding of xanthan and nanoparticles, respectively.

With the innovation in the theory of augmented reality and rapid advancement of real-time applications (robotics), there is a requirement to advance a system or a method to optimize the latency time in various challenging conditions. However, there is no standard method for optimizing glyph detection latency time through the Augmented Reality framework in the literature. Even though, currently some applications are using the marker (glyph) less AR system, there are challenges in the detection of object in real-time application and to overcome this complication, the glyph detection system is proposed. Here, we propose the machine glyph detection algorithm and mathematical formulation which calculate the optimized latency time through the rectifier and infra-red light in challenging conditions. The detection process and position of glyph have been processed by the â€˜AForge.NET Frameworkâ€™ and the POSIT algorithm. The experimentation outcomes calculate the performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of optimizing latency and accuracy.

Some suitable similarity transformations reduced the governing boundary layer non-linear partial differential equations into a set of ordinary non-linear differential equations. The transformed equations are then solved numerically using fourth order Runga-Kutta method along with Shooting technique. The major outcomes of the present study is that the magnetic field impedes the fluid motion while thermal as well as mass buoyancy forces accelerate it, the thermophoretic diffusion enhances dimensionless fluid temperature as well as concentration leading to thicker thermal and concentration boundary layers. On the other hand, concentration exponent, Brownian motion parameter and chemical reaction parameter exhibit reverse trend on temperature and concentration. In addition, the presence of magnetic field under the influence of thermal as well as mass buoyancies supports to reduce the rate of heat transfer as well as wall shear stress while the first order chemical reaction develops a thinner concentration boundary layer.

The multi-term general fractional diffusion equation containing force terms and a time dependent absorbent term is taken into account. Fractional calculus is applied to describe the phenomenon of sub-diffusion of oxygen in both transverse and longitudinal directions. A new computational algorithm, i.e., the new iterative method (NIM) is employed to solve the spatio-temporal fractional partial differential equation subject to appropriate physical boundary conditions. Validation of NIM solutions is achieved with a modified adomian decomposition method (MADM). A parametric study is conducted for three loading scenarios on the capillary-radial force alone, axial force alone and the combined case of both forces. The results demonstrate that the force terms markedly influence the oxygen diffusion process. For example, the radial force exerts a more profound effect than axial force on sub-diffusion of oxygen indicating that careful manipulation of these forces on capillary-tissues may assist in the effective reduction of hypoxia or other oxygen depletion phenomena.

If the servers find no waiting failed unit in the system and the number of servers on vacation is less than the total number of servers, then these servers can take vacation individually and continue to take vacation if the vacation condition is satisfied.

Because of a special intensity gradient distribution in DHGBs, the emitted THz radiation is found to have a unique field profile with multiple focii. The dependence of plasma density, order of the beams and collision frequency on the THz field amplitude is discussed. The important feature to consider hollow Gaussian laser beams is having the same power at different beam orders.

The Chun\'s scheme provides user anonymity and eviction of unauthorized users. In our research work we have crypt analyze the Chun\'s method and shown that it is vulnerable to various types of attacks: insider attack, off line password verifier attack, stolen verifier attack and impersonating attack. To overcome the security vulnerability of Chun\'s scheme, we have proposed an advance scheme of password authentication and user anonymity using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and stegnography.

It is also known as brittle bone disease. Surgical procedure is one of the ways adopted by clinicians for the management of OI. In recent years, it has however become clear that physical activity is equally important for managing OI in both children and adults. Exogenous mechanical stimulation e.g. prophylactic exercises may be useful in improving the bone mass and strength of OI bones as loading-induced mechanical components e.g. normal strain and canalicular fluid flow stimulate remodeling activities. Several studies have characterized the strain environment in OI bones, whereas, very few studies attempted to characterize the canalicular fluid flow. In the present study, we anticipate that canalicular fluid flow reduces in OI bone as compared to healthy bone under physiological loading. This work accordingly computes the canalicular fluid distribution in the single osteon model of OI and control/normal bones subjected to normal physiological loadings. A transversely isotropic poroelastic model of osteon is developed. Loading is applied in accordance with gait cycles reported for OI and healthy bones. Fluid distribution patterns computed for OI and healthy bones are compared at different time-points of stance phase of the gait cycle. A significant reduction in fluid flow is observed in case of OI bone as compared to healthy bone. This clearly indicates that improvements in physical activities or exercises can be designed to enhance the level of canalicular fluid flow to initiate possible osteogenic activities and the bone.

Out of the three types of complainants (consumer complaint intention), voice complaint intention appeared as the strongest determinant of consumer trust and retention as compared to private and third party complaint intention. On providing complaint handling, the strength of the relationship improved to the greatest extent for private complaint intention while there was no effect of complaint handling for voice complaint intention. Results of the study highlight as to what extent complaint handling matters for different types of complainants (voice, private and third party).

This decoupling provides several advantages such as flexibility, programmability, and centralized control. However, SDN also introduces new vulnerabilities due to the required communication between data plane and control plane. Examples of threats that leverage such vulnerabilities are the control plane saturation and switch buffer overflow attacks. These attacks can be launched by flooding the TCP SYN packets from data plane (i.e., switches) to the control plane. This paper presents SAFETY, a novel solution for the early detection and mitigation of TCP SYN flooding. SAFETY harnesses the programming and wide visibility approach of SDN with entropy method to determine the randomness of the flow data. The entropy information includes destination IP and few attributes of TCP flags. To show the feasibility and effectiveness of SAFETY, we implement it as an extension module in Floodlight controller and evaluate it under different conditional scenarios. We run a thorough evaluation of our implementation through extensive emulation via Mininet. The experimental results show that when compared to the state-of-the-art, SAFETY brings a significant improvement (13%) regarding processing delay experienced by a legitimate node.

While most such studies have been conducted on constant speed stationary engines and modern engines, this study tried to analyze the effectiveness of an uncoated wall-flow type ceramic diesel particulate filter on a Euro-I, water-cooled, direct injection, variable speed, compression ignition engine in a laboratory set-up in India. Also, this study focused on diesel particulate filter regeneration by two methods: active regeneration by diesel injection in the particulate filter using an electronic control unit and off-board regeneration by taking out and heating the diesel particulate filter in an electrical resistance furnace at 650Â Â°C for 10Â h. The results, in the form of smoke emission, NOx emission and engine performance, obtained using both the regeneration methods were analyzed, and conclusions were drawn. It was found that using diesel particulate filter, particulate matter emissions (smoke) were almost entirely eliminated. It was also found that off-board regeneration had numerous advantages compared to active regeneration. Since a furnace would be needed for off-board regeneration, an exchange process for diesel particulate filter is suggested.

Flexural strength of concrete is one of its key mechanical property. By virtue of its flexural strength, concrete beams and slabs are able to transfer the loads to the supports. The present concrete matrix gives only 10 to 12 percent of flexural strength as compared to its compressive strength. Human hair lasts for decades before finally decomposing and entering to Carbon and Nitrogen cycle. The waste human hair dumped in the streams chokes the streams and increases the environmental burden. In this experimental work, feasibility for enhancing the flexural strength of concrete with two-dimensional variation in human hair i.e., the length of hair fiber and its proportion in the concrete matrix, has been investigated. The concrete specimens tested at the age of 7 and 28 days, reveled an increase in the flexural strength as compared to the control mix. The results indicated the possibility of using human hairs as fibers in the concrete mix for sustainable construction practices.

The seedlings were exposed to salinity, drought or waterlogging stresses for 4 weeks. The cultivars differed significantly in their biomass accumulation, tissue ion concentrations and steviol glycoside accumulation. The salt tolerant cv. Fengtian contained higher concentrations of K + which led to higher K + /Na + ratio in the leaves, as compared to the less salt tolerant cv. Shoutian-2. Reduced biomass accumulation in cv.

Sensors generate sensitive data in many applications and thus methods to secure the data so as to prevent easy access by unauthorized agents are essential. Security against false data injection or data tampering can be provided through encryption of sensor data; but it increases load on processing. Securing data, however, puts a burden on the node battery. Data aggregation aims both at data reduction so as to spend less time for encryption as well as reduce transmission load, but demanding additional processing at aggregating node. Thus, aggregation and security are contradictory solutions. The dilemma can be resolved by allowing targeted malleability of encrypted data through homomorphic encryption. The recent research works recommend schemes which use homomorphic MACs, signatures and a blend of private and public cryptography to achieve the purpose. This paper proposes a generalized framework which will be more secure in aspects of secure data aggregation and security of data which include the data privacy and detection of tampering data through homomorphic primitive.

Results: The power density reached its maximum over two to three days (0.58 ÂµW cm âˆ’2 ), and declined thereafter. Fourier transform infrared analysis of the residual lignin indicated the cleavage of Câ€“Oâ€“C (Î²-O-4) bonds without disturbing the phenolic ring structure and high-power liquid chromatography analysis confirmed the presence of vanillin in the depolymerized sample.

The problem has been solved taking into consideration the constraint that congested cities of the network have been pushed behind after obtaining a fit set of chromosomes in every iteration so that as the time pass by the load sheds on the cities and we optimize in terms of time as well. The concept can very well be mapped to the network routing problem as well. Experimental results show that the efficiency of the proposed model is high in comparison to the serial version where the machine certainly meets the restrictions in terms of execution and processing power to get the intensive computations done as the number of cities or nodes in the network increases.

Recent studies depict that the performance of network and its utilization can be enhanced by QoS (Quality of Service) routing protocol. Thus, QoS is the essence of the WSNs. So, in this paper, we would like to present a detailed survey of the various routing protocols which play a vital role in attaining the QoS in WSNs. Methods: There are various levels of QoS which are required by the WSNs depending on the applications that they focus upon. The QoS support to WSNs can be achieved by various routing protocols. Thus, a detailed research on various routing protocols is done depicting their strengths and weakness and a comparison table of various protocols on various parameters is provided. Results: The QoS basically aims to focus on the quality that is perceived by the users of various applications. The QoS facilitates the above aim in terms of delay, packet delivery ratio, reduction in power of the sensor nodes, energy efficiency, bandwidth utilization, amount of through put generated and many other factors. However, there are few challenges faced by QoS which may occur due to dynamic topology and constrained resources. Even after these challenges the research suggests QoS is undisputedly the essence of WSNs. Conclusion: The QoS is very advantageous as it helps in improving the service provided to the users, and is accountable in improving the quality of output perceived by the users of various applications. Researchers have started working to overcome the challenges of QoS with the aim to minimize its constraints and maximize its multiple objectives.

Our model is primarily based on Deep Convolutional Neural Network (Deep CNN) as they are capable of capturing interesting visual features at each hidden layer. We aim at constructing a customisable switch that can turn â€˜onâ€™ if it finds a given trigger gesture in any video that it receives and stays â€˜offâ€™ if it does not. The model was trained on images of various hand gestures in a multi-class classification setting. This allows the user to choose a custom trigger gesture for oneself. To test the efficiency of such a model in the trigger detection process, we have made 7,000 videos (each 10s long) consisting of random images from the test set which were never shown to the model during the training process. It is experimentally shown that such a system has a better performance than the other state-of-the art techniques used in static hand gesture image recognition tasks.

Incessant hard work of researchers across the world has acquired incredible upgrades in the techniques involved in PET recycling. This paper reviews (a) the most viable methods that have emerged over the years for concoction reusing of PET with extraordinary accentuation on glycolytic depolymerization of PET with ethylene glycol; (b) the different process and late improvements towards expanding the monomer yield; and (d) effect of new innovations, for example, nanotechnology, on future improvements of compound reusing of PET and utilization of recycled PET in the packaging sector.

In silico models assumed normal strain or strain energy density (SED) as the stimulus to predict loading-induced osteogenesis, however, these models may have limited success in fitting the in vivo new bone formation at several instances. For example, rest-inserted cyclic loading amplifies the new bone formation as compared to continuous-cyclic loading even though similar strain magnitude were induced in both the cases. It is also believed that loading-induced interstitial fluid flow can also be a potential stimulus of osteogenesis. The present study hypothesizes that fluid motion as osteogenic stimulus may explain the afore-mentioned anomalies. Accordingly, this work studies osteogenesis as functions of SED and canalicular fluid motion using an in silico model. Therefore, the new bone formation is considered roughly proportional to stimuli above their osteogenic thresholds. This model attempts to simulate in vivo new bone formation noticed in rest-inserted cantilever loading studies. The model\'s prediction of site-specific new bone formation improves when fluid flow is considered as the stimulus. It is also noticed that fluid motion as the stimulus closely fits the new bone formation for another in vivo study where the effects of aging on osteogenesis were examined. These attempts to establish fluid flow as a potential osteogenic stimulus can be useful in the prediction of site-specific new bone formation. The findings will ultimately be useful in designing biomechanical interventions such as prophylactic exercises to cure bone loss.

In the third world country like India because of cost effectiveness CFLs are still used without any power factor correction circuitry. Recently the power factor improvement tool is made compulsive for CFL and the recommended range as suggested by IEC 61000-3-2 is greater than 0.85. In addition to this the current harmonic distortion is preferred to be around 30% as per the standards. But unfortunately there are still CFLs available in the market which have less power factor in comparison with the desired standards. This has caused substantial problems not only on the generation side, but it certainly has considerable impact on the lamp performance. In the present work in order to exemplify this problem, four CFLs of 15W each from two different manufacturers are used for the experiment. Out of these four lamps, two lamps are ballast with low input power factor and instant start type. The other two are incorporated with improved input power factor having rapid start or warm start circuitry. The lamps are constantly switched ON and OFF at regular intervals. The interval was taken as 5 minutes ON and 5 minutes OFF. The lamps were subjected to this accelerated switching test. At the end of every switching cycle the electrode temperature was calculated from the ratio of hot resistance to cold resistance. It was thus observed that lamps with instant start ballast and poor power factor were unable to sustain the switching stress as compared to the lamps with rapid start ballast and improved power factor. Furthermore, the rise in electrode temperature for the lamps with improved power factor was within the desired standards. Thus it was concluded that lamps with poor power factor was more prone to early end in comparison with the other variety.

A new generative classifier known as MassBayes, works without making any assumptions and estimates multi-dimensional likelihood. We evaluate the MassBayes and two different versions of NaÃ¯ve Bayes (NaÃ¯ve Bayes using Kernel Density Estimator and NaÃ¯ve Bayes using Discretisation) for Pendigits data set.

Ambient temperature dry curing was done without any water when some proportion of fly ash was replaced by GGBFS.

The ratio of flyash to alkali solution was kept 0.35 & 0.40.

Since its launch in 2009, Bitcoin economy has grown at an enormous rate, and it is now worth about 150 billions of dollars. This exponential growth in the market value of bitcoins motivate adversaries to exploit weaknesses for profit, and researchers to discover new vulnerabilities in the system, propose countermeasures, and predict upcoming trends. In this paper, we present a systematic survey that covers the security and privacy aspects of Bitcoin. We start by giving an overview of the Bitcoin system and its major components along with their functionality and interactions within the system. We review the existing vulnerabilities in Bitcoin and its major underlying technologies such as blockchain and PoW-based consensus protocol. These vulnerabilities lead to the execution of various security threats to the standard functionality of Bitcoin. We then investigate the feasibility and robustness of the state-of-the-art security solutions. Additionally, we discuss the current anonymity considerations in Bitcoin and the privacy-related threats to Bitcoin users along with the analysis of the existing privacy-preserving solutions. Finally, we summarize the critical open challenges, and we suggest directions for future research towards provisioning stringent security and privacy solutions for Bitcoin.

In this paper, we propose a new clustering algorithm based on LEACH.

Numbers are very frequently spoken words where recognition of these words plays a major role in Telugu speech recognition. These spoken words are preprocessed using various techniques like de-noising, framing, sampling, transformations, and endpoint detection. Methods like mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and combined MFCC with modified group delay functions (MODGDF) are used for extracting the features. Extracted features are used for training and testing phase. Multilayer perceptron (MLP) and time lagged recurrent neural network (TLRN) patterns are trained and tested. Comparison is done for MLP and TLRN with the feature extraction techniques MFCC and MODGDF-MFCC. Integrated MODGDF-MFCC gives best accuracy in training and testing phases.

In the same context, this paper proposes a hybrid TOPSIS-PSI approach for effective material selection in marine applications. In this paper, the selection index value has been calculated by using logical combination of PSI and TOPSIS algorithm and these values have been ranked in ascending or descending order. The highest preference selection index value has been taken as the best alternative for the marine application. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid TOPSIS-PSI algorithm, two practical examples are considered and the result shows that the proposed procedure provides satisfactory results when compared with past literature. Furthermore, hybrid procedure is performed for selection of best wt.% combination among hybrid aluminum nanocomposites for marine applications based on its physical, mechanical and corrosive behavior. The result reveals that 9 wt.% and 6 wt.% reinforced hybrid aluminum nanocomposites have optimum combination of all physical, mechanical and corrosion properties, respectively according to hybrid TOPSIS-PSI approach.

An integrated approach has been used to incorporate ultrafineÂ fluorcanasite (FC) glass-ceramic particulates within nanocellulose matrix, synthesized from lignocellulosic biomass. Epichlorohydrin (ECH) was used as a chemical cross-linking agent for hydrogel synthesis. The compositions and properties of bio-nanocomposite hydrogels were controlled by varying the loading of FC and ECH. Moreover, microstructural characterizations and functional group analysis of synthesized nanocellulose and bio-nanocomposite hydrogels were carried out using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). SEM studies revealed successful extraction of cellulosic nanofibres and interconnected porous micro-architecture of injectable hydrogels. Incorporation of FC particulates resulted into development of well-defined micro-porous morphology. FT-IR studies indicated the presence of hydroxyl groups and possible interactions between nanocellulose and FC reinforcements. The rheological study of the developed injectable hydrogel was carried out at different frequency, amplitude and temperature sweeps. The studies revealed that after the incorporation of FC, dynamic storage modulus increased, while synergistically enhancing the injectability of the bio-nanocomposite hydrogels. An optimum loading level of FC reinforcement could also be established. Swelling behaviour studies of the hydrogels demonstrated higher degree of swelling and enhanced structural integrity with incorporation of FC. The novel bio-nanocomposite injectable hydrogels developed in this study,Â could demonstrate promising potential as injectable implant material.

Image encryption can be done through different methods, these are cryptographic algorithms and various transforms were used for Image encryption. In this paper, an innovative Image encryption algorithm is proposed using Image Pixel Scrambling and DFrFT. The Image pixel scrambling operation is performed using the sequence generated by the chaotic function. The scrambled Image is encrypted through DFrFT.

The MWCNT/Cu composite wire samples were characterized for electrical and mechanical properties. We have been able to achieve an increase of around 8% in electrical conductivity of the form wires repeatedly. It has been observed that there was gradual improvement in the properties with reinforcement of MWCNT in the copper matrix. The betterment of electrical property has been achieved with simultaneous improvement in mechanical properties of the wire. The yield strength of MWCNT/Cu composite wire was found to be four times and the tensile strength two times greater than that of pure copper. The improved properties are attributed to the proper distribution of MWCNTs in the copper matrix and excellent interfacial bonding between MWCNT and composite copper fabricated by the modified method.

In this microarray-based study of diabetic and normal glucose tolerant Asian Indians, we generated the transcriptome of their thigh adipose tissue and analyzed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using weighted gene co-expression network analysis; further we identified perturbed pathways implicated by these DEGs in relevant co-expression modules. We also attempted to link these pathways with known aspects of T2D pathophysiology in terms of their association with some of their intermediate traits, namely; adipocyte size, HOMA-B, HOMA-R, Hb1Ac, insulin, glucose-level, TNF-Î±, IL-6, VLDLs, LDLs, HDLs, and NEFAs. It was observed that several modules of co-expressed genes show an association with diabetes and some of its intermediate phenotypic traits mentioned above. Therefore, these findings suggest a role of peripheral subcutaneous adipose tissue in the pathophsiology of T2D in Asian Indians. Additionally, our study indicated that the peripheral subcutaneous adipose tissue in diabetics shows pathologic changes characterized by adipocyte hypertrophy and up-regulation of inflammation-related pathways.

Therefore, we present a systematic computational study on the spin polarized transport in surface oxidized GNR in antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin configuration using density functional theory combined with non-equilibrium Green\'s function (NEGF) method. It is found that the conductance in oxidized GNRs is significantly suppressed in the valance band and the conduction band. A further reduction in the conductance profile is seen in presence of two oxygen atoms on the ribbon plane. This change in the conductance may be attributed to change in the surface topology of the ribbon basal plane due to presence of the oxygen adatoms, where the charge transfer take place between the ribbon basal plane and the oxygen atoms.

The normalized governing equations are reduced with lubrication approximations (long wavelength and low Reynolds number assumptions). Poisson-Boltzmann equation is also simplified by using Debye-HÃ¼ckel linearization. No slip conditions are imposed at the channel walls. The analytical solutions are obtained for temperature field and nanoparticle volume fraction. However, a perturbation method is used to find out an approximate solution for axial velocity, pressure rise and volumetric flow rate. The perturbation solutions are further graphically illustrated with MATLAB software. The perturbation solution is also validated with numerical results simulated by MATLAB coding through BVP command. The effects of thermal radiation and non-Newtonian parameters on flow characteristics, pumping characteristics, wall shear stress and trapping phenomenon are discussed. A comparative study is also made to study the electroosmotic flow through uniform and nonuniform asymmetric microfluidic channel.

This is when mobile agents are used for data aggregation to exploit redundant and correlated data. The efficiency of agent-based data aggregation depends on the agent migration scheme. However, in general, most of the proposed schemes are centralized approach-based schemes where the sink node determines the migration paths for the agents before dispatching them in the sensor network. The main limitations with such schemes are that they need global network topology information for deriving the migration paths of the agents, which incurs additional communication overhead, since each node has a very limited communication range. In addition, a centralized approach does not provide fault tolerant and adaptive migration paths. In order to solve such problems, we have proposed a distributed approach-based scheme for determining the migration path of the agents where at each hop, the local information is used to decide the migration of the agents. In addition, we also propose a local repair mechanism for dealing with the faulty nodes. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme performs better than existing schemes in the presence of faulty nodes within the networks, and manages to report the aggregated data to the sink faster.

Recent advancements in nanotechnology-based medicines have opened new horizons for combating multidrug resistance in microorganisms. In particular, the use of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) as a potent antibacterial agent has received much attention. The most critical physico-chemical parameters that affect the antimicrobial potential of AgNPs include size, shape, surface charge, concentration and colloidal state. AgNPs exhibits their antimicrobial potential through multifaceted mechanisms. AgNPs adhesion to microbial cells, penetration inside the cells, ROS and free radical generation, and modulation of microbial signal transduction pathways have been recognized as the most prominent modes of antimicrobial action. On the other side, AgNPs exposure to human cells induces cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, and inflammatory response in human cells in a cell-type dependent manner. This has raised concerns regarding use of AgNPs in therapeutics and drug delivery. We have summarized the emerging endeavors that address current challenges in relation to safe use of AgNPs in therapeutics and drug delivery platforms. Based on research done so far, we believe that AgNPs can be engineered so as to increase their efficacy, stability, specificity, biosafety and biocompatibility. In this regard, three perspectives research directions have been suggested that include (1) synthesizing AgNPs with controlled physico-chemical properties, (2) examining microbial development of resistance toward AgNPs, and (3) ascertaining the susceptibility of cytoxicity, genotoxicity, and inflammatory response to human cells upon AgNPs exposure.

The electrohydrodynamic (EHD) problem is also simplified under the Debye linearization. Closed-form solutions for the linearized dimensionless boundary value problem are derived. With increasing Hartmann number, the formation of bolus in the regime (associated with trapping) is inhibited up to a critical value of magnetic field. Flow rate, axial velocity and local wall shear stress are strongly decreased with greater Hartmann number whereas pressure difference is enhanced with higher Hartmann number at low time values but reduced with greater elapse in time. With greater electro-osmotic parameter (i.e. smaller Debye length), maximum time-averaged flow rate is enhanced, whereas the axial velocity is reduced. An increase in electrical field parameter (i.e. maximum electro-osmotic velocity) causes an increase in maximum time-averaged flow rate.

First area is equipped with a single reheat thermal unit and a superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) unit, while another area has a hydro-unit with SMES. A multi-stage optimization strategy for the optimal solution of FLC for tie-line and frequency oscillation suppression is proposed in this paper using an ant colony optimization technique. The optimization of FLC is carried out in four different stages. The first stage is the optimization of range of input and output variables; the second stage is the optimization of membership function; the third and fourth stages are the optimization for rule base and rule weight optimization, respectively. The performance of the proposed controller is also compared with another control approaches to stabilize Ptie-line and Î”f oscillations; these are the Zieglerâ€“Nichols-tuned proportionalâ€“integralâ€“derivative (PID) controller and genetic algorithm optimized PID controller.

Crimes affect the quality of life, economic growth, and reputation of a nation. There has been an enormous increase in crime rate in the last few years. In order to reduce the crime rate, the law enforcements need to take the preventive measures. With the aim of securing the society from crimes, there is a need for advanced systems and new approaches for improving the crime analytics for protecting their communities. Accurate real-time crime predictions help to reduce the crime rate but remains challenging problem for the scientific community as crime occurrences depend on many complex factors. In this work, various visualizing techniques and machine learning algorithms are adopted for predicting the crime distribution over an area. In the first step, the raw datasets were processed and visualized based on the need. Afterwards, machine learning algorithms were used to extract the knowledge out of these large datasets and discover the hidden relationships among the data which is further used to report and discover the crime patterns that is valuable for crime analysts to analyse these crime networks by the means of various interactive visualizations for crime prediction and hence is supportive in prevention of crimes.

Handling electrolytes in typical peristaltic channel material such as polyvinyl chloride and Teflon leads to the generation of a net surface charge on the channel walls, which attracts counter-ions and repels co-ions from the aqueous solution, thus leading to the formation of an electrical double layer-a region of net charges near the wall. We analyze the spatial distribution of pressure and wall shear stress for a continuous wave train and single pulse peristaltic wave in the presence of an electrical (electroosmotic) body force, which acts on the net charges in the electrical double layer. We then analyze the effect of the electroosmotic body force on the particle reflux as elucidated through the net displacement of neutrally buoyant particles in the flow as the peristaltic waves progress. The impact of combined electroosmosis and peristalsis on trapping of a fluid volume (e.g., bolus) inside the travelling wave is also discussed. The present analysis goes beyond the traditional analysis, which neglects the possibility of coupling the net pumping of fluids due to peristalsis and allows us to derive general expressions for the pressure drop and flow rate in order to set up a general framework for incorporating flow control and actuation by simultaneous peristalsis and application of electric fields to aqueous solutions. It is envisaged that the results presented here may act as a model for the design of lab-on-a-chip devices.

Furthermore, Au alloys constitute an important model system in the context of corrosion, dealloying, and stress corrosion cracking. Adsorbed self-assembled monolayers of thiol molecules inhibit the dealloying reaction. On thiol-modified Cu-Au alloys dealloying finally proceeds in a localized reaction instead of a homogeneous process. Using ethanethiols as an example, we show here that thiols can be effectively removed by application of anodic oxidation. Homogeneous porosity forms then after an oxidation step. In-situ X-ray diffraction and crystal truncation rod analysis of ethanethiol-modified Au (001) confirms that a bare Au surface is recovered after a similar oxidation step. In consequence, a multi-step dealloying process including complete initial thiol-layers as well as partially or fully re-cleaned surfaces can produce different micro-cracks, providing larger scale openings, and homogeneous nanoporous Au in between. Such hierarchically structured surfaces may show superior applicability for reactions where mass transport into the porous layer plays a decisive role for the reaction rate or detection probability.

The Poisson-Boltzmann equation for electric potential distribution is implemented owing to the presence of an electrical double layer (EDL) in the micro-channel. Using long wavelength, lubrication theory and Debye-Huckel approximations, the linearized transformed dimensionless boundary value problem is solved analytically. The influence of electro-osmotic parameter (inversely proportional to Debye length), maximum electro-osmotic velocity (a function of external applied electrical field) and couple stress parameter on axial velocity, volumetric flow rate, pressure gradient, local wall shear stress and stream function distributions is evaluated in detail with the aid of graphs. The Newtonian fluid case is retrieved as a special case with vanishing couple stress effects. With increasing the couple stress parameter there is a significant increase in the axial pressure gradient whereas the core axial velocity is reduced. An increase in the electro-osmotic parameter both induces flow acceleration in the core region (around the channel centreline) and it also enhances the axial pressure gradient substantially.

The cilia are arranged at equal intervals and protrude normally from both walls of the infinitely long channel. A metachronal wave is generated due to natural beating of cilia and the direction of wave propagation is parallel to the direction of fluid flow. Appropriate expressions are presented for deformation via longitudinal and transverse velocity components induced by the ciliary beating phenomenon with cilia assumed to follow elliptic trajectories. The conservation equations for mass, longitudinal and transverse (linear) momentum and angular momentum are reduced in accordance with the long wavelength and creeping Stokesian flow approximations and then normalized with appropriate transformations. The resulting non-linear moving boundary value problem is solved analytically for constant micro-inertia density, subject to physically realistic boundary conditions. Closed-form expressions are derived for axial velocity, angular velocity, volumetric flow rate and pressure rise. The transport phenomena are shown to be dictated by several non-Newtonian parameters, including micropolar material parameter and Eringen coupling parameter, and also several geometric parameters, viz eccentricity parameter, wave number and cilia length. The influence of these parameters on streamline profiles (with a view to addressing trapping features via bolus formation and evolution), pressure gradient and other characteristics are evaluated graphically. Both axial and angular velocities are observed to be substantially modified with both micropolar rheological parameters and furthermore are significantly altered with increasing volumetric flow rate. Free pumping is also examined. An inverse relationship between pressure rise and flow rate is computed which is similar to that observed in Newtonian fluids.

Thereby, knowledge on the contaminant source zone and especially the source zone geometry, i.e., SZG is critically required, yet very uncertain. This study identifies current limitations and open research questions in the formation and shape determination of source zone geometry, as well as its relevance for contaminant plumes. Our literature review reveals that existing characterization methods are subject to data interpretation uncertainties, while the application of these methods on field scale is limited by technical demands and accompanied efforts. In a next step, methods to implement increased source zone information into calculation methods are discussed. By means of an exemplary application of selected assessment tools, i.e., plume response models, results clearly proof the relevance of SZGs for site assessment. However, existing plume response models consider over-simplified geometries that may compromise their suitability. Our findings identify the demand for improved characterization of complex SZGs and the need to better evaluate the dependency of DNAPL migration on system properties and external influences.

Key aspects of various network models include reaction schemes, structural characteristics and applications to CFD simulations. Recent advances in understanding reaction mechanisms using mechanistic models have been summarized. Importance of inherent inorganic species in biomass pyrolysis is also critically analysed. Future studies of biomass pyrolysis modelling should focus on developing multiscale models considering reactions of all biomass components (i.e., cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, inorganic species and extractives) and potential interactions.

Preventive maintenance is a proactive method to tackle and overcome from these types of problems. For this purpose, a stochastic model is developed for single-unit systems by using semi-Markov process. There is a single server who inspects the failed unit after failed to check the feasibility of repair and replacement. If repair is not feasible then unit is replaced with some replacement time. The failed unit after repair becomes degraded and degraded failed unit is replaced by new one.

A two-phase nanoscale formulation is adopted which is more appropriate for biophysical systems. The flow is induced by metachronal beating of cilia and the flow geometry is considered as a cylindrical tube. The analysis is carried out under the low Reynolds number and long wavelength approximations and the fluid and cilia dynamics is of the creeping type. A Lorentzian magnetic body force model is employed and magnetic induction effects are neglected. Solutions to the transformed boundary value problem are obtained via numerical integration. The influence of cilia length parameter, Hartmann (magnetic) number, heat absorption parameter, Grashof number (free convection), solid nanoparticle volume fraction, and cilia eccentricity parameter on the flow and heat transfer characteristics (including effective thermal conductivity of the nanofluid) are examined in detail. Furthermore a comparative study for different nanoparticle geometries (i.e. bricks, platelets and cylinders) is conducted. The computations show that pressure increases with enhancing the heat absorption, buoyancy force (i.e. Grashof number) and nanoparticle fraction however it reduces with increasing the magnetic field. The computations also reveal that pressure enhancement is a maximum for the platelet nano-particle case compared with the brick and cylinder nanoparticle cases. Furthermore the quantity of trapped streamlines for cylinder type nanoparticles exceeds substantially that computed for brick and platelet nanoparticles, whereas the bolus magnitude (trapped zone) for brick nanoparticles is demonstrably greater than that obtained for cylinder and platelet nanoparticles. The present model is applicable in biological and biomimetic transport phenomena exploiting magnetic nanofluids and ciliated inner tube surfaces.

Peristalsis is one of the most efficient of these mechanisms and offers considerable promise in microscale fluidics. Electrokinetic peristalsis has recently also stimulated significant attention. Electrical and magnetic fields also offer an excellent mode for regulating flows. Motivated by novel applications in electro-conductive microchannel transport systems, the current article investigates analytically the electromagnetic pumping of non-Newtonian aqueous electrolytes via peristaltic waves in a two-dimensional microchannel with different peristaltic waves propagating at the upper and lower channel wall (complex wavy scenario). The Stokes couple stress model is deployed to capture micro-structural characteristics of real working fluids. The unsteady two-dimensional conservation equations for mass and momentum conservation, electro-kinetic and magnetic body forces, are formulated in two dimensional Cartesian co-ordinates. The transport equations are transformed from the wave frame to the laboratory frame and the electrical field terms rendered into electrical potential terms via the Poisson-Boltzmann equation, Debye length approximation and ionic Nernst Planck equation. The dimensionless emerging linearized electro-magnetic boundary value problem is solved using integral methods. The influence of Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity (characteristic electro-osmotic velocity), couple stress length parameter (measure of the polarity of the fluid), Hartmann magnetic number, and electro-osmotic parameter on axial velocity, volumetric flow rate, time-averaged flow rate and streamline distribution are visualized and interpreted at length.

If we analyze the financial inclusion, we will found that achieving the financial inclusion is based on two pillars - demand side and supply side. Where availability of the financial products in the market is very important, equally important is the fact that people are aware of them and they are in a situation to demand those products. In this context, financial literacy among the masses is very important, so that people have the awareness about the financial climate and financial products. This will increase their capability to demand for the financial products. This way, it can achieve the target of financial inclusion. Research Methodology: The research work is based on the secondary data. These data are obtained fromRBI publications, research papers and text books. It also uses secondary data from various other sources- newspapers, journals and periodicals like Economic Times, Business Line, Micro-Finance world etc. The study is designed as follows: In section-1 we introduce the concept of financial inclusion. An attempt is made to understand meaning, role and importance of financial inclusion. Section-2 will describe the link between financial inclusion and financial literacy and the various facets of it. In section-3 we provide our conclusions and some suggestions. Findings: Financial inclusion is an attempt to achieve the ultimate objective i.e. inclusive growth. Financial inclusion is an important constituent of this, because a financially deprivement is a very big deterrent of a person\'s overall development. Our study reveals that the final answer of financial inclusion rests on both sides-demand side and supply side. It is now, becoming increasingly apparent that addressing the problem of financial exclusion will require a holistic approach in creating awareness about not only on credit management but on financial products, education, debt counseling, savings and advice on money management.

Over the time, diabetes can damage the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys, and nerves. Early diagnosis can be made through a relatively inexpensive method of computation.

Various researchers have also been done to predict the diabetes machine learning algorithm, but this is an additional effort in the research work based on a specific type of patient in a specific community. In this research work, a data sample of Pima Indians was taken to predict the possibility of diabetes. Among several algorithms of Machine learning, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was chosen for building the model to predict diabetes. This model is ideal for predicting the possibility of diabetes with 92% accuracy while tested with the sample test data.
