abstract={Second law effects on Williamson fluid flow over a stretching sheet with non-linear convection in the presence of porous media has been done. Variable viscosity, Chemical reaction and non-linear thermal radiation effects has also been analysed. An external inclined magnetic field has been applied and assumed that the effect of induced inclined magnetic field is negligible. By applied suitable similarity transformations, governing equations has been changed into ordinary differential equations, after this the reduced equations are solved numerically by Runge-Kutta fourth order method with shooting technique. The effects of the appropriate parameters on velocity, temperature, concentration and entropy are discussed graphically. © 2019 by American Scientific Publishers.},

abstract={Stevia rebaudiana (Bert.) Bertoni is cultivated for its sweet leaves as they contain steviol glycoside sweeteners such as stevioside and rebaudioside A. Two cultivars of S. rebaudiana, Shoutian-2 and Fengtian, were evaluated in a greenhouse for their tolerance to abiotic stresses. The seedlings were exposed to salinity, drought or waterlogging stresses for 4 weeks. The cultivars differed significantly in their biomass accumulation, tissue ion concentrations and steviol glycoside accumulation. The salt tolerant cv. Fengtian contained higher concentrations of K + which led to higher K + /Na + ratio in the leaves, as compared to the less salt tolerant cv. Shoutian-2. Reduced biomass accumulation in cv. Shoutian-2 coincided with increased Na + and Cl ˗ concentrations in the leaves. The waterlogging stress reduced growth of both cultivars, but the salinity stress increased rebaudioside A concentration in the tolerant cv. Fengtian, and the drought stress increased stevioside concentration in the cv. Shoutian-2. This study concludes that the two cultivars of S. rebaudiana differ in their tolerances to salinity and drought stresses. © 2019 South African Association of Botanists},

abstract={A clinically oriented Computer-Aided Diagnostic (CAD) system is of prime importance for the diagnosis of melanoma, since the deadly disease is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, the development of CAD tools is hampered by several issues, such as (i) smooth boundaries between the lesion and the surrounding skin, (ii) subtlety of features between the melanoma and non-melanoma skin lesions, and (iii) lack of reproducibility of CAD systems due to complexity. The proposed system aims to address the aforementioned issues. First, the lesion regions are localized by incorporating chroma based deformable models. Second, the lesion patterns are analyzed to detect various dermoscopic criteria. Further, a robust ensemble architecture is developed using dynamic classifier selection techniques to detect malignancy. Quantitative analysis is performed on two diverse datasets (ISBI and PH2) achieving an accuracy of 88% and 97%, sensitivity of 95% and 97% and specificity of 82% and 100% for ISBI and PH2 datasets respectively. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={A theoretical model is suggested to examine the consequences of ciliary activity on the propulsion of micropolar fluid through a two-dimensional channel. The inner walls of the channel are carpeted with cilia such that their coordinated beatings produce a metachronal wave. Long wavelength and low Reynolds number approximations are implemented to obtain the exact solutions of the governing differential equations. Special attention is given to investigate the pumping and the trapping characteristics of the micropolar fluid due to ciliary metachronism. The motivation of this study is to understand the mechanisms underlying the transport of human semen through ductuli efferentes.

For this analysis, transition diagram of all subsystems is drawn and respective Chapman–Kolmogorov differential equations are derived using Markov birth–death process. All failure and repair rates of each subsystem are exponentially distributed. Various measures of system effectiveness like mean time between failures, mean time to repair and dependability ratio for all the three subsystems are also computed. Sensitivity analysis of system reliability is also performed. The reliability and maintainability are estimated at various time instants. Analysis of all the subsystems shows that sulphited syrup is highly sensitive from reliability point of view.

abstract={Sterculia urens Roxb., has been vastly used in pharma, health care, food, cosmetics, waste management, paper-textile, composite fiber, and leather industries, for a long period of time. Gum exudate of this tree is of high market value, therefore, in the name of its exudate, plant is commonly known as ‘Karaya Gum’ tree. Polymers of karaya gum are ideal choice over synthetic ones because of its natural availability, cost effectiveness, non-hazardous nature, easy recovery, and physicochemical properties. Moreover, the tree is widely used in tribal populations for its indigenous remedies against various ailments like oligospermia, leucorrhoea, constipation, body swelling, throat infection, wound healing, etc. Biochemical analysis authenticates photophysical, photochemical as well as pharmacological uses, and validates ethnobotanical applications by tribal communities up to some extent. The main purpose of this review is to highlight the potential of Sterculia urens, based on its ethnobotanical uses, industrial potential and perspectives of conservation and sustainable management. A comprehensive survey of literature was done to further explore various growth constraints, conservation strategies, and wide industrial applications. Sterculia urens has embraced significant values in international trade market due to its exceptional properties. Also the presence of diverse bioactive compounds has made this plant of interest for scientific research. Owing to the wide range of commercial applications and lack of knowledge regarding the scientific gum tapping methods, the plant has been exploited extensively for its highly valued products, while the propagation in natural habitat has been declining over the past few years. Excessive consumption of karaya gum has resulted in critically low abundance and thus this plant is now considered as endangered plant species in some states of India. Keeping in view its endangered status, conservation, and mass scale production through biotechnological approaches are fruitful towards maintaining its biological abundance. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Searching secret key of classical ciphers in the keyspace is a challenging NP-complete problem that can be successfully solved using metaheuristic techniques. This article proposes two metaheuristic techniques: improved genetic algorithm (IGA) and a new discrete cuckoo search (CS) algorithm for solving a classical substitution cipher. The efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed techniques are compared to the existing tabu search (TS) and genetic algorithm (GA) techniques using three criteria: (a) average number of key elements correctly detected, (b) average number of keys examined before determining the required key, and (c) the mean performance time. As per the results obtained, the improved GA is comparatively better than the existing GA for criteria (a) and (c), while the proposed CS strategy is significantly better than rest of the algorithms (i.e., GA, IGA, and TS) for all three criteria. The obtained results indicate that the proposed CS technique can be an efficient and effective option for solving other similar NP-complete combinatorial problems also. Copyright © 2019, IGI Global.

The kinetic models are based on the global reaction mechanisms and have been extensively used for a wide range of biomass under various operating conditions. Major emphases have been on the network models as these models predict the structural changes during biomass pyrolysis. Key aspects of various network models include reaction schemes, structural characteristics and applications to CFD simulations. Recent advances in understanding reaction mechanisms using mechanistic models have been summarized. Importance of inherent inorganic species in biomass pyrolysis is also critically analysed. Future studies of biomass pyrolysis modelling should focus on developing multiscale models considering reactions of all biomass components (i.e., cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, inorganic species and extractives) and potential interactions. © 2019},

abstract={In this paper, a systematic investigation of electronic structure and optical properties of quaternary chalcopyrite semiconductors Cu 2 ZnGeS 4 and Cu 2 ZnGeSe 4 in stannite and kesterite structures using the full-potential linearized augmented plane wave method are presented. The electronic structures and related properties of the crystals are studied with density functional theory using modified Becke – Johnson (mBJ) potential. The computed bands and density of states are found to be in good agreement with the available experimental and theoretical results. Important optical properties such as, dielectric functions, absorption spectra, refractivity and reflectivity of the crystals have also been investigated using the mBJ exchange potential. The imaginary parts of dielectric tensor are analyzed in terms of interband transitions. The band gap energies of stannite CuZnGeS 4 (CuZnGeSe 4 ) and kesterite CuZnGeS 4 (CuZnGeSe 4 ) compounds are obtained as 1.23 (0.74) eV and 1.52 (1.08) eV, respectively.

abstract={The pseudorelativistic behaviour of carriers is found in the energy bands of certain class of two dimensional (2D) semi-conducting materials such as phosphorene. In this article, the nonlinear optical response of pseudorelativistic electrons in phosphorene under intense applied electromagnetic field is investigated. Using Floquet theory, we demonstrate the anisotropic behaviour of anomalous Rabi oscillations in phosphorene, which occurs far from the conventional resonance. The role of anisotropy on anomalous Rabi oscillations in phosphorene is also justified numerically. The Bloch-Siegert shift is observed under strong driving field that strongly depends on the anisotropy of the energy bands of phosphorene. A theoretical description of the pump-probe experiment is given to detect the anomalous Rabi oscillations in phosphorene. The differential transmission coefficient shows a sinusoidal behaviour as a function of pump pulse duration whose amplitude exhibits a power law decay, which is quite different from graphene (relativistic fermionic system). So the Floquet theory can be used to characterize the different fermionic systems. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

The Sep/FAEM(42%) composite PCM developed in stabilized form was characterized by SEM, FTIR and XRD analysis techniques. The DSC results exhibits that the produced form-stabilized composite PCM (FSt-CPCM) had proper melting temperature (22.86 °C) and relatively high latent heat capacity (76.16 J/g) for thermal regulation targets of building spaces. The FSt-CPCM showed outstanding chemical stability and TES reliability although it was exposed to 1000 melt/freeze cycles. In addition, cement plaster containing FSt-CPCM exhibited appreciated temperature control performance in laboratory scaled-test room compared to ordinary cement plaster.

abstract={Zn 1−x Co x O (x = 0.0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.07) nanoparticles were synthesized via sol-gel method. For structural parameters like lattice constants, bond length and particle size, XRD patterns have been analyzed. The particle sizes lie between 15.75 and 35.31 nm. The Williamson-Hall analysis has been performed for strain calculation. The UV–Visible spectra show high transparency in visible range with a dip in near UV region. The band gap calculation has been done using Tauc's plot method. The band gap values show a quartic variation with x. PL emission spectra exhibit NBE emission that too undergoes quartic variation with x. The correlation between both the quartic variations has been analyzed and it has been established that the B-M effect and sp-d exchange interaction both play their role alternately. M-H curves of the Co doped nanoparticles show room temperature ferromagnetism whereas the undoped one have the diamagnetic character. The electrical resistivity has been found to be high; in the range of 4.81 × 10 4 to 7.26 × 10 4 Ω-m. A increasing trend in resistivity is noticed with increasing the Co concentration in ZnO matrix. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Selection of material in engineering design process is a difficult and elusive task due to enormous number of dissimilar materials availability. For effective selection of materials, the designers have to take into account a number of definite qualitative and quantitative criteria. In the same context, this paper proposes a hybrid TOPSIS-PSI approach for effective material selection in marine applications. In this paper, the selection index value has been calculated by using logical combination of PSI and TOPSIS algorithm and these values have been ranked in ascending or descending order. The highest preference selection index value has been taken as the best alternative for the marine application. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid TOPSIS-PSI algorithm, two practical examples are considered and the result shows that the proposed procedure provides satisfactory results when compared with past literature. Furthermore, hybrid procedure is performed for selection of best wt.% combination among hybrid aluminum nanocomposites for marine applications based on its physical, mechanical and corrosive behavior. The result reveals that 9 wt.% and 6 wt.% reinforced hybrid aluminum nanocomposites have optimum combination of all physical, mechanical and corrosion properties, respectively according to hybrid TOPSIS-PSI approach. © 2019, Indian Academy of Sciences.},

abstract={Background: A microbial electrochemical cell was designed for lignin depolymerization. Alkali-extracted wheat straw lignin was used as catholyte in a microbial fuel cell and operated for six days. At the cathode, lignin was depolymerized by H 2 O 2 , produced during microbial fuel cell operation. Results: The power density reached its maximum over two to three days (0.58 µW cm −2 ), and declined thereafter. Fourier transform infrared analysis of the residual lignin indicated the cleavage of C–O–C (β-O-4) bonds without disturbing the phenolic ring structure and high-power liquid chromatography analysis confirmed the presence of vanillin in the depolymerized sample. Conclusion: The proposed strategy involves a self-sustainable microbial electrochemical process to convert complex lignin into low molecular weight value-added aromatic chemicals such as vanillin. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry},

abstract={The effects of elevated ozone (O 3 ) levels (80 ppb and 120 ppb) on photosynthetic efficiency and growth of canola plants were studied in open-top chambers. The chlorophyll a polyphasic fluorescence rise kinetics OJIP, stomatal conductance and Chlorophyll Content Index (CCI) were measured after 15 and 30 days of O 3 fumigation, as well as in control plants; biomass measurements were done only after 30 days with and without fumigation. Analysis of the OJIP kinetics by the JIP-test led to the calculation of several photosynthetic parameters and the total Performance Index (PI total ). The decline of PI total under the 80 ppb O 3 treatment was due to a lower density of reaction centres (RC/ABS), while the notable decline under the 120 ppb treatment was found to be due both to a further decline of RC/ABS and to a pronounced lowering of the efficiency with which an electron can move from the reduced intersystem electron acceptors to the PSI end acceptors (δ Ro ). Stomatal conductance was affected by both treatments. Biomass was found to be affected by O 3 fumigation (for 30 days), decreasing by 40% at 80 ppb and by more than 70% under 120 ppb. Our findings indicate that biomass decline is due both to the lowering of CCI and the lowering of photosynthetic efficiency parameters. They thus suggest that two simple, non-invasive and rapid methods, namely, the analysis of OJIP fluorescence transients and the measurement of CCI, can be used to screen the effect of elevated O 3 on biomass of canola plants. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

After fabrication, these bioengineered foam nano-composites were studied for microstructural, mechanical and thermal characterizations. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis indicated the presence of characteristic functionalities within biopolyol segments, which was influenced by reactant activity within the polyurethane (PU) foams. Scanning electron microscopy revealed the cellular morphology of the foam. Thermogravimetric analysis enabled the study of foam decomposition behavior for different sample compositions. Incorporation of NC into pristine foam was found to delay the onset degradation temperature. Flammability studies depicted significant enhancement of flame retardancy with incorporation of NC up to a certain loading level. Compression tests demonstrated that significant improvement of compressive strength properties of foams could be achieved by incorporating bentonite nanoclay, owing to nucleation effect of nanoclay and corresponding enhanced structural integrity. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstract={Selective lignin degrading white rot fungi viz. Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Phlebia brevispora, and Phlebia floridensis were selected to evaluate antioxidant potential and auxin (indole acetic acid) production in complex and synthetic medium. Antioxidant potential of these fungi was tested against different free radicals including 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), nitric oxide, ferrous ion, and ferric ion along with total phenolic content. All the fungal strains produce phenolics ranging from 5.2 to 16.7 mg/ml and demonstrated various free radical and metal ion scavenging activity. Growth medium significantly affected all the activities. Almost similar antioxidant activity (~ 72% DPPH scavenging activity) was demonstrated by all the fungi in yeast extract glucose medium; however, the activity was lower in Czapek dox’s medium (from 60 to 45%). Indole acetic acid production was maximum in P. brevispora (31 μg/ml), which was closely followed by P. chrysosporium and P. floridensis. The extracts did not show any mutagenic or cytotoxic effect. Thus, these white rot fungi highlight their significance as a new source for the prompt production of extracellular antioxidants and auxin. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={A large number of mechanism were anticipated for copper since 1988 in NaCl medium. The detail electrochemical behavior leading to the anodic dissolution of copper, however, still remains uncertain. Herein, an Imidazopyrimidine Dye, named, 4-amino-3-(phenyldiazenyl)benzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-2(1H)-one, (APIP) has been used as a copper corrosion inhibitor in 3.5 wt.% (by weight) NaCl solution. The present investigation provides a brief mechanistic overview of the electrochemical mechanism of copper in aerated NaCl solution, simulating a static marine environment, with and without addition of APIP inhibitor. Potentiodynamic polarization (PDP) results confirmed that the APIP can suppress copper corrosion effectively at low concentration in 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution with an inhibition efficiency of 92.79% due to adsorption, along with the prediction of electrochemical mechanism. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements showed that the corrosion inhibition of Cu proceeds via both diffusion and kinetic controlled processes. Adsorption of APIP on copper surface is well fit with the Langmuir isotherm model and mode of adsorption is proposed. Antimicrobial activity was also studied and the result obtained showed ‘‘eco-friendly’’ nature of APIP. Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM), Energy dispersion X-ray (EDX) and Attenuated Total Reflectance-Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) observations of the copper surfaces confirmed the existence of adsorption of APIP thus can be potentially used in industries in which seawater is implied are numerous such as cooling water systems, desalination plants, power plants, and oil production units. Results obtained from theoretical calculations including quantum chemical density functional theory (DFT) method and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations confirms the experimental findings and provide further insight into the mode of adsorption on the copper surface. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Temperature dependent relativistic mean-field (RMF) plus BCS approach has been used for the first time to investigate the anti-bubble effect of the temperature and deformation in the light, medium-heavy and superheavy nuclei. Influence of temperature is studied on density distribution, charge form-factor, single particle (s.p.) energies, occupancy, deformation and the depletion fraction (DF). At T=0, the quenching effect of deformation is predominant. DF is found usually less in oblate deformation than in prolate. DF decreases with increasing prolate deformation even though the 2s-orbit is empty which shows the role of deformation in central depletion apart from the unoccupancy in s-orbit as is usually believed. As T increases, the occupancy of s-orbit increases, shell structure melts, the deformation vanishes and the weakening of central depletion is solely due to the temperature. The bubble effect is eliminated at T≈3–5 MeV as indicated by DF and the charge form factor. The temperature effect is found less prominent in superheavy bubble nuclei where the role of shell effects is indicated. © 2018},

A single-ended primary inductance converter (SEPIC) topology is designed and driven in continuous conduction mode (CCM) with advance feedback system to maintain constant voltage at output. A proportional integral (PI) controller is also proposed to make the system stable, and stability analysis is discussed in detail with the help of transfer function derived from the state space model. Bode, Nyquist and Polar plots are clearly drawn using the MATLAB tool to claim the system stability. For justification of mathematical analysis, a simulation of the proposed LED driver is also performed in MATLAB-Simulink using sim-power toolbox. The simulation results show the improved value of power quality indices like power factor (PF), total harmonic distortion (THD) and crest factor (CF) with constant rating of 84V, 1.5A at output.

abstract={Background: The purpose of the research was to improve the polyp detection accuracy in CT Colonography (CTC) through effective colon segmentation, removal of tagged fecal matter through Electronic Cleansing (EC), and measuring the smaller polyps. Methods: An improved method of boundary-based semi-automatic colon segmentation with the knowledge of colon distension, an adaptive multistep method for the virtual cleansing of segmented colon based on the knowledge of Hounsfield Units, and an automated method of smaller polyp measurement using skeletonization technique have been implemented. Results: The techniques were evaluated on 40 CTC dataset. The segmentation method was able to delineate the colon wall accurately. The submerged colonic structures were preserved without soft tissue erosion, pseudo enhanced voxels were corrected, and the air-contrast layer was removed without losing the adjacent tissues. The smaller polyp of size less than < 10mm was detected correctly. The results were statistically validated qualitatively and quantitatively. Segmented colons were validated through volumetric overlap computation, and accuracy of 95.826±0.6854% was achieved. In polyp measurement, the paired t-test method was applied to compare the difference with ground truth and at α=5%, t=0.9937 and p=0.098 was achieved. The statistical values of TPR=90%, TNR=82.3% and accuracy=88.31% were achieved. Conclusion: An automated system of polyp measurement has been developed starting from colon segmentation to improve the existing CTC solutions. The analysis of domain-based approach of polyp has given good results. A prototype software, which can be used as a low-cost polyp diagnosis tool, has been developed. © 2019, Asian Pacific Organization for Cancer Prevention.},

abstract={The intrauterine fluid motion is responsible for embryo transport and its implantation at fundus. It is believed that myometrial contractions induced by peristaltic propulsion and pressure gradient typically regulate the intrauterine fluid movement. Several factors like changes in the mechanical behavior of uterus with age, hormonal variations, number of pregnancies, and mode of delivery (vaginal delivery versus cesarean), and any gestation may impair this mechanism. There are limited reports which indicate that the intrauterine fluid movement is possible to control with the help of external electric or magnetic fields. However, there are very few studies that investigate the intrauterine fluid motion in the presence of aforementioned external stimuli. This encouraged us to develop a computer model to study intrauterine fluid movement induced by peristalsis in the presence of electro-magnetohydrodynamics. Uterus geometry is idealized as a tapered micro-channel, whereas the Williamson fluid model is used to represent the intrauterine fluid. The Debye-Hückel linearization and perturbation method are employed to obtain the mathematical solution for fluid motion in the presence of any external field. The effect of the Debye-Hückel parameter, Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity, zeta potential and Hartmann number on pumping characteristics, flow characteristics, shear stress and trapping are studied to analyze the sensitivity of the fluid model. Overall, this study presents a model to understand the behavior of the intrauterine fluid motion in the presence of electric and magnetic fields. The model and associated results may be encouraged and may helpful for biomedical engineers in the design and development of such biomicrofluidic devices which can transport the embryo at a suitable location of the uterus for implantation. © 2019, Società Italiana di Fisica and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The study of electroosmotic flow of biorheological fluids has been employed in the advancement of diversified biomicrofluidics systems. To explore more in this field, a mathematical model is developed to investigate the electroosmotic flow of pseudoplastic aqueous nanoliquids in microchannel. A tangent hyperbolic fluid model is employed to describe the rheological behavior of the pseudoplastic fluid. Here, analytical solutions for potential distribution, temperature and nanoparticle fraction are derived and perturbation solution for stream function, pressure gradient and volumetric flow rate are obtained. The convective boundary condition is applied on the channel walls. The authentic assumptions of Debye–Hückel linearization, long wavelength and small Reynold’s number are employed in the dimensional conservative equations. The influences of various emerging parameters are graphically computed for axial velocity, pressure gradient, thermal temperature, nanoparticle volume fraction, skin friction coefficient and Nusselt profiles. To observe the thermal radiation effects, a thermal radiative flux model is also deployed. It is noticed that the heat transfer Biot number increases with increasing thermal temperature; however, a reversed behavior is reported for the nanoparticle volume fraction. Therefore, the present model does not only provide a deep theoretical insight to interpret the electroosmotic flow systems, but it will also be applicable in designing the emerging tool for biomicrofluidic devices/systems under peristalsis mechanisms. © 2019, The Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering.},

abstract={Human malaria, one of the most striking, reemerging infectious diseases, is caused by several types of Plasmodium parasites. Whilst advances have been made in lowering the numbers of cases and deaths, it is clear that a strategy based solely on disease control year on year, without reducing transmission and ultimately eradicating the parasite, is unsustainable. Natural products have served as a template for the design and development of antimalarial drugs currently in the clinic or in the development phase. Artemisinin combine potent, rapid antimalarial activity with a wide therapeutic index and an absence of clinically important resistance. The alkylating ability of artemisinin and its semi-synthetic analogues toward heme related to their antimalarial efficacy are underlined. Although impressive results have already been achieved in malaria research, more systematization and concentration of efforts are required if real breakthroughs are to be made. This review will concisely cover the clinical, preclinical antimalarial and current updates in artemisinin based antimalarial drugs. Diverse classes of semi-synthetic analogs of artemisinin reported in the last decade have also been extensively studied. The experience gained in this respect is discussed. © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS},

abstract={Clustering is a useful technique to create different groups of objects on the basis of their nature. Objects of same group are of similar in nature and differ to the objects of other groups. Clustering has proved its importance in various fields such as information retrieval, bioinformatics, image processing and many others. In this paper, particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique is used with K-harmonic means (KHM) for clustering. PSO overcomes the limitations of KHM like local optimum problem. Fuzzy logic is also employed in this paper to make PSO adaptive in nature by controlling various parameters. The performance of the proposed approach is validated on five benchmark datasets in terms of inter-clustering distance, intra-clustering distance, F-measure and fitness value. The results of proposed approach are compared with well-known conventional clustering techniques such as K-means, KHM and fuzzy C-means along with different state-of-the-art clustering approaches. Two text-based benchmark datasets such as CACM and CISI are also used to test the performance of all clustering approaches. The proposed clustering approach gives better results in comparison with other clustering approaches as clear from both the experimental and statistical analyses. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Purpose: Global competition has intensified pressure on small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to implement lean. Recently, the debate has converged to the role of lean implementation barriers (LIBs). The purpose of this paper is to contribute to this debate by exploring the LIBs in SMEs through three case studies. Design/methodology/approach: A case study approach was employed followed by interpretive structural modelling (ISM) to model the interrelationship among the LIBs. Findings: This study reveals that lack of management commitment, leadership and resources are the key barriers to lean implementation in SMEs in India. Furthermore, poor communication between different levels of the organisation and inadequate dissemination of the knowledge of lean benefits also creates hindrance in lean implementation. Managerial implications of the identified barriers for lean implementation in SMEs have been discussed. Originality/value: The research regarding lean implementation in SMEs is scarce. This study is the first attempt of its kind to identify the lean barriers in a small industry setup through mathematical analysis. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The existence of bubble nuclei identified by the central depletion in nucleonic density is studied for the conventional magic N (Z) = 8, 20, 28, 40, 50, 82, 126 isotones (isotopes) and recently speculated magic N = 164, 184, 228 superheavy isotones. Many new bubble nuclei are predicted in all regions. Study of density profiles, form factor, single particle levels and depletion fraction (DF) across the periodic chart reveals that the central depletion is correlated to shell structure and occurs due to unoccupancy in s-orbit (2s, 3s, 4s) and inversion of (2s, 1d) and (3s, 1h) states in nuclei upto Z ≤ 82. Bubble effect in superheavy region is a signature of the interplay between the Coulomb and nn-interaction where the depletion fraction (DF) is found to increase with Z (Coulomb repulsion) and decrease with isospin. Our results are consistent with the available data. The occupancy in s-state in 34 Si increases with temperature which appears to quench the bubble effect. © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={Effective maintenance planning plays a significant role in increasing life and productivity of physical systems or equipment. For products such as automotive vehicles, the warranty planning is also a crucial decision for the automaker as they have to set aside the budget to deal with warranty claims. Both warranty decision and maintenance planning aspects depend on the reliability of the product. Higher reliability means fewer warranty claims and maintenance issues. This necessitates the more realistic reliability assessment of the product not only for design improvement but also for maintenance planning and warranty decisions. This paper provides degradation based reliability assessment considering component dependency and presenting a framework for maintenance planning. The critical role of the individual component in enabling system function is also included in this paper. Further, an improved preventive maintenance and warranty plan are suggested with the help of an automotive vehicle case study. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Magnetohydrodynamics plays important role to manipulate the physiological fluids due to magnetic nature of physiological fluids. Magnetohydrodynamics pumps are a robust technology which provide more elegant and sustainable performance compared with conventional medical pumps. To study the effects of suspension of the nanoparticles (drugs) in physiological fluids (blood) flow are important in biomedical science and engineering. Motivated by such applications, an analytical approach is presented to study the nanoparticle shape effects on peristaltic transport of nanofluids in presence of magnetohydrodynamics in the present article. A two dimensional continuity, momentum and energy equations are considered to govern the present biophysical model. The governing equations are also linearized using lubrication theory where we consider the low Reynolds number and long wavelength approximations. Closed form solutions are obtained for axial velocity, axial pressure gradient, temperature, pressure rise, wall shear stress and stream function. The effects of three different type of shapes (bricks, cylinders, and platelets) of nanoparticles on peristaltic pumping characteristics and thermal characteristics are computed with the help of graphical illustrations. The interesting outcomes of this study are relevant to more realistic designs for ocular peristaltic pumps in drug delivery systems. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={In recent time, latency plays a key role in the entire concept of augmented reality as well as in real-time applications. With the innovation in the theory of augmented reality and rapid advancement of real-time applications (robotics), there is a requirement to advance a system or a method to optimize the latency time in various challenging conditions. However, there is no standard method for optimizing glyph detection latency time through the Augmented Reality framework in the literature. Even though, currently some applications are using the marker (glyph) less AR system, there are challenges in the detection of object in real-time application and to overcome this complication, the glyph detection system is proposed. Here, we propose the machine glyph detection algorithm and mathematical formulation which calculate the optimized latency time through the rectifier and infra-red light in challenging conditions. The detection process and position of glyph have been processed by the ‘AForge.NET Framework’ and the POSIT algorithm. The experimentation outcomes calculate the performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of optimizing latency and accuracy. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

First, a modified non-homogeneous Poisson process model is developed in an imperfect debugging environment by assuming that new faults may be introduced in fault detection and correction process. Then, the detection rate and remaining faults of previous release are considered in the modeling and analysis of reliability of the current release. The optimal version-update time is computed using multi-attribute utility theory for these software systems, considering the two main utility factors, namely, rapid release strategy and level of reliability. The proposed models are verified on real data sets and are compared with other existing models.

abstract={Feeding system is an important unit in sugar manufacturing plants. It comprises with the help of six components, namely unloader, cane carrier, crushing unit, bagasse carrier unit, boiler and turbine. All these components are connected in series configuration and some components also have internal redundancy such as unloader is composed in 1-out-of-2: G and turbine 1-out-of-2: G with one standby structures. All these components generally show constant behaviour during repair and failure. So, here all failure and repair rates are considered as exponentially distributed. To fulfill the main objective of the present study, a mathematical model is developed for feeding system and C-K differential equations have been developed for fuzzy availability and profit analysis. In case of imperfect fault detection concept of coverage factor is also used. Numerical results also obtained for a particular case to highlight the importance of the study.

Global DFT based descriptors have been computed for ground state configurations and low-lying isomers of (CuS) n clusters. Computed HOMO-LUMO gaps, lying in the range of 1.25–3.53 eV, indicate that (CuS) n clusters may be utilized as renewable energy sources specially in photocatalysis and solar cell applications. A statistical correlation has been established between electronic and photo-catalytic properties of copper-sulfide clusters with their computational counterparts.

In this Internet age, online publicity plays a major role in the success of a movie, so we felt the need of including sentiment analysis of tweets related to movies in our study. We used a variety of data mining models to get predictions as accurate as possible. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Steganography is an application for concealed writing. Nowadays, development in the field of electronic media demands highly secure data transfer between computers over the globe. There is a pressing demand to send the secret information in the hidden form. Conceal writing is an ultimate feature of steganography which fulfills this demand. In general; a robust steganography scheme should have better visual imperceptibility of the hidden information with sufficient payload. In this paper, a steganography method based on cryptography is proposed. The proposed scheme uses two processes; first, encrypt the secret plaintext (PT) message followed by secret image generation from this encrypted message. Second, hide this secret image into the cover image using Daubechies discrete wavelet transform operation followed by mixing operation. After performing the Daubechies inverse discrete wavelet transform (IDWT) process, we get the stego image. Stego image visual quality is increased by using Daubechies wavelet. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is shown by experimental results. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Leakage has been the main issue in SRAM design due to the scaling of CMOS devices. In this paper, a novel technique has been proposed for 8T SRAM to reduce leakage current at 45-nm technology node. Here, we have used three different reverse body biasing techniques to reduce the leakage power. The three techniques used are: clamping of NMOS diode, clamping of PMOS diode, and clamping of NMOS and PMOS diode. Out of the three techniques, leakage current in 8T SRAM was minimum using PMOS clamping diode as compared to other proposed techniques. The supply voltage has been varied from 0.5 to 0.85 V. The leakage current has been reduced by both NMOS and PMOS clamping techniques, but the results for PMOS and NMOS were high as compared to two but lower than that of SRAM cell. The leakage current improved by 3.3x using PMOS technique and 2.7x using NMOS technique at supply voltage of 0.5V. The static power has also been calculated and compared for the three techniques. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={The hasty headway in the field of information technology has lead ways for an escalating crime rate being technically exhaustive. The crimes involving digital tools and devices assist to be the forensic evidences. An upsurge in digital evidences is coalesced with the growing size of storage devices. Pertaining to the ineffectualness of the traditional analysis methods to handle the colossal amount of digital data, the forensic investigators have to adopt big data analytics to store, recover, and analyze the digital evidence. The storage of digital evidence calls for surveillance and security, thereby preserving its evidential significance. The digital analysis and fraud detection make the recovery and storage of digital data achievable by effective data reduction and exploiting the features of data mining for storage and data archive. Advancement with the forensic analysis assures automated management of digital data thus safeguarding the sensitivity of data. The paper aims to take the facets of data reduction for efficient storage and retrieval of digital data, and an overall digital forensic research framework has been outlined. The proposed work supports the existing framework for data reduction and storage. It also outlines the challenges and the unaddressed aspects of digital forensics. In this paper, I also discussed the unaddressed aspects of forensic investigations and peaks into the loopholes and the opportunity realms that can lay groundwork for future. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.},

abstract={The various potential properties of nanomaterials make them prominent for most of the applications, used in our day-to-day life. Due to increase in the use of the nanomaterials, it is anticipated that the manufacturing and use of engineered nanoparticles (NP) will also grow rapidly. These engineered nanoparticles became toxic sometimes during the process of manufacturing as well as utilizing. Hence, there is a vital requirement for early recognition of toxic nature of these nanoparticles. Computational modelling is an effective approach for the same, which predicts toxicity on the basis of previous experimental data or molecular properties. QSAR is an emerging process to envision the toxicity based on their molecular structure properties. The various data mining techniques can accelerate this computation task and help in accurate and fast toxicity prediction.

abstract={Creating technology enhanced optimized strategies to handle the subsequent healthcare issues emerged from natural calamities and disaster has now become more tranquil with the latest advancements in networking and low power electronics. Proposed system addresses an immediate action plan in accordance with the various adverse medical affronts during and post disaster events. The study focuses on developing strategies for disaster management in India, where flooding of rivers is one of the frequently occurring drastic event around the years in various regions resulting many people died due to unavailability of medical facilities. There are many studies conducted which proves that managing medical emergencies like cardiac seizure during such disasters where doctors unable to reach in these remotely affected areas due to damaged transportation systems by flood and they are struggling to provide prompt delivery of medical as well as relief to the remotely affected areas. Thus, it is gaining significant attention by disaster management organizations. Therefore, this study proposes a classic solution for handling various medical emergencies that occurs during and post disaster events. The system uses the drones to carry a weight of 1.5 kg to 2 kg medical kits to the affected areas. Miniaturized IoT based medical devices are designed with various Wireless Body Area Sensors (WBAS) and actuators. Along with a defibrillator unit and ECG analyzer. These medical kits are placed in a connected drone and this will drive to the affected areas aerially. All the devices are IoT enabled and are connected through the central cloud infrastructure of hospital by which medical experts can access the required medical parameters and convey the instructions through drone to a caretaker in real time to perform related events which may possibly postpone casualties. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={MEMS pressure sensor has shown a remarkable change in revenue collection during the year 2018. Due to recent growth in smart microsystem technology for automation systems, demand has grown substantially for sensors. High sensitivity, flexibility, miniaturization and bulk production are some of the key factors of a pressure sensor in achieving new heights in the MEMS market. In this paper, Graphene piezo resistive material has been analysed for pressure sensing elements and compared with Polysilicon in terms of sensitivity and sensor performance degradation at different temperature. MEMS pressure sensors using Polysilicon and Graphene piezo resistive materials were simulated on silicon (100) substrate by COMSOL Multiphysics 5.3a version. The simulation result shows that at room temperature polysilicon pressure sensor performs well with pressure sensitivity of 3.81 mV/psi as well as it is found that graphene pressure sensor also shows better results at room temperature showing a pressure sensitivity of 3.98 mV/psi. As on frequently increasing the temperature it is noticed that polysilicon pressure sensitivity degrades with a factor of 0.64 mV/psi. However, graphene pressure sensor shows very less variation in sensitivity at higher temperature. Although it shows a small increment of 0.02 mV/psi in the pressure sensitivity. This analysis opens the path to utilise the graphene pressure sensor at high temperature. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={In the era of Internet of things (IoT), the sensors play an important role and also face a challenge of energy consumption. Sensors in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) deals with accumulation and processing of data and forward that to the remote locations, generally considered as cloud. Generally, communication is done between the nodes which are placed at a far locations in the field. Hence, the energy consumption required to communicate the nodes plays an important role. In this paper, the proposed algorithm is based on low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchical (LEACH) routing algorithm named as multi-hop cluster LEACH (MC LEACH) algorithm. The proposed protocol is a cross-layer routing protocol that deals with physical, MAC, and network layers for the analysis of energy consumption at individual node as well as in whole network. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.},

This paper consists of an architecture by which the clients place their request through the frontend and the generated request is forwarded to scheduling team which takes care of stock availability. If the stock is available, it prepares a backlog based on it and the logistics part mainly deals with warehouse, logistics and shipment which consist of information about the stock. The challenges of this work lie with the migrating issues like communicating with legacy system E1 with proposed system E2 and the SAP modules as data transfer has to take place in a way which the system understands.

abstract={Diabetes is one of the major diseases of the population across the world. Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot efficiently use the insulin it produces. In 2014, 8.5% of adults aged 18 years and older had diabetes. In 2012, diabetes was the direct cause of 1.5 million deaths and high blood glucose was the cause of another 2.2 million deaths [1]. Over the time, diabetes can damage the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys, and nerves. Early diagnosis can be made through a relatively inexpensive method of computation. In this paper, Machine Learning, a branch of Artificial Intelligence is used to analyze and make the diabetes prediction model. Various researchers have also been done to predict the diabetes machine learning algorithm, but this is an additional effort in the research work based on a specific type of patient in a specific community. In this research work, a data sample of Pima Indians was taken to predict the possibility of diabetes. Among several algorithms of Machine learning, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was chosen for building the model to predict diabetes. This model is ideal for predicting the possibility of diabetes with 92% accuracy while tested with the sample test data. This model can achieve more accuracy if it is trained with a large sample training data in the future. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.},

abstract={Steganography is the art of hiding a message within another so that the presence of the hidden message is indiscernible. People who are not intended to be the recipients of the message should not even suspect that a hidden message exists. Text steganography is challenging as it is difficult to hide data in text without affecting the semantics. Retention of the semantics in the generated stego-text is crucial to minimize suspicion.This paper proposes a technique for text steganography using classical language Sanskrit. As Sanskrit is morphologically rich with a very large vocabulary, it is possible to modify the cover text without affecting the semantics. In addition numerical encoding is used to map a Sanskrit character to a numerical value. This helps in hiding the message effectively. Moreover, in this technique, a key is used for additional security. The key is generated dynamically and is appended to the final message to further add security to the proposed method. The proposed method generated stego-texts with syntactic correctness of 96.7%, semantic correctness of 86.6%, and with a suspicion factor of just 23.4% upon evaluation. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019},

abstract={Variations in wavefunction confinement under external uniaxial strain are observed to affect the optical gain obtained in type-II quantum well nanodimension heterostructures. This paper reports the wavefunctions and optical gain realized in In0.3Ga0.7As/GaAs0.4Sb0.6 type-II double QW heterostructure under uniaxial strain along [001]. Energy bands, wavefunctions of confinement states in the structure and optical gain of the heterostructure under electromagnetic field perturbation are presented. The 6 × 6 k·p Hamiltonian matrix is considered, and Luttinger–Kohn model has been applied for the electronic band structure calculations. Optical gain spectra of the double QW nanoheterostructure under external uniaxial strain of 1, 2 and 5 GPa, respectively, is calculated. The optical gain curve shows a significant improvement in gain under external uniaxial strain along [001] at 300 K. For a charge carrier injection of 8 × 1012/cm2, the optical gain is 9170 in x polarization. The heterostructure is seen to be operating in the energy range of 0.65–0.8 eV (1549–1907 nm). Thus, a wide range wavelength tuning can be realized. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.},

abstract={A numerical investigation of water-based CNTs’ nanofluid flow over an inclined 3-D nonlinear stretching sheet with homogeneous–heterogeneous reactions in the presence of porous media subject to convective boundary condition has been done. In this paper, we have considered two types of CNTs; one is single-walled carbon nanotube and the second is multi-walled carbon nanotube. By using suitable similarity governing equations, the equations are converted into ordinary differential equations. The reduced equations are solved numerically by Runge–Kutta fourth-order method with shooting technique. The influence of the pertinent parameters on different profiles like velocity, concentration, and temperature are discussed and presented graphically. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.},

abstract={Nanoswimmers are of interest among researchers for their utility in propelling nanorobots to specific target for drug delivery, nanosurgery, in vivo biomedical applications such as in treatment of brain tumor and Alzheimer’s disease and similar applications. On-board powering is the major concern for locomotion of nanoswimmer and is being considered to be addressed by energy transduction mechanism to harness energy from surrounding using energy of stochastic vibrations by electrostatic, electromagnetic, and piezoelectric means. Among all, piezoelectric is emerging as a promising conversion transduction mechanism of energy harnessing for artificial nanoswimmer. In this context, in present work, an elastic flagellum of a nanoswimmer is modeled as a cantilever beam and a simulation study is done in COMSOL. The novel design of branched flagellum is conceived, modeled, and simulated. COMSOL simulation studies have been performed to compare the effect of primary and secondary branching in flagellum design in terms of stress and electric potential. Enhancement in stress and electric potential is observed approximately 20 and 15% on increasing secondary branching uniformly on the main structure of cantilever beam towards free end and keeping primary branches constant. An enhanced stress allows for larger efficiency of conversion mechanism and, therefore, it is concluded that branching of flagellum can be pivotal in increasing on-board harnessing of energy for propulsion of nanorobots. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.},

abstract={Microstrip patch antennas are one of the most widely used antenna structures in communication because of their small size but they also have a disadvantage of having a narrow bandwidth. Here, we have used the superformula given by Gielies, which is used to represent any natural shape mathematically. In this paper, the performance of a triple modified superformula-inspired patch antenna is investigated and all the results are systematically presented. The antenna is designed using Rogers RO4003 substrate (εr = 3.55) and is excited using a CPW feed. The first bandwidth is of 53% at central frequency 1.23 GHz and the second bandwidth is of 52% at central frequency 5.93 GHz. The 5.9 GHz frequency is used by the dedicated short-range communication technology (DSRC). It is used to enhance the safety of transportation.

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) employs a large number of sensors and actuators to collect and act upon data for its smart functionalities. These devices are considered as a part of the Low-power and Lossy Networks due to their use of low power embedded hardware and computationally constrained nature. For synchronization and utility, these devices are often clubbed together logically to form groups. To maintain data confidentiality within a group, a shared symmetric key called the Group Key (GK) is used by all the group members. The GK must be redistributed upon joining and leaving of a group member to maintain forward and backward secrecy. However, the key management (i.e., generation and distribution) process causes overhead which consumes the scarce network resources. In this paper, we propose TARE, a novel Topology Adaptive Re-kEying (TARE) scheme for lightweight and secure group communication. TARE integrates the principles of routing tree mapped logical key tree and local derivation of the key over the an IPv6 Routing Protocol for low-power and Lossy networks in an original way. TARE takes into consideration the current routing topology and makes maximum energy reduction as the premise for its choice of key derivation and distribution methods, thus, it reduces the network energy consumption while maintaining key secrecy and data confidentiality. In particular, TARE provides the following advantages: (1) lower network overhead and bandwidth utilization in key management and re-distribution operations, (2) effective against the network mobility in scalable IoT networks, (3) secure group communications in network against attacks such as man-in-the-middle and eavesdropping, and (4) data confidentiality by ensuring backward and forward secrecy in key distribution method. We evaluate the performance of TARE and compare it with existing schemes. Our results show the effectiveness of TARE regarding energy consumption, bandwidth utilization, and the number of encrypted message transmissions during the re-keying operations. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={NEMO means Network Mobility which is the extension of Mipv6 and it is invented for accessing internet for the group of people when they are travelling in Vehicle as Network group. During handoff while exchanging Binding Updates (BU) between the Mobile Network Node (MNN), Correspondent Node (CN) and Home Agent (HA), many security threats are present during those messages exchange. It may prone to several standard malicious attacks on the BU and Binding Acknowledgement. An efficient end-to-end security method is required to protect the BU Exchange between MNN, HA and CN. In this paper, a secure architecture is proposed to provide authentication and confidentiality at each level of communication using a 3-Party Key Exchange called 3-PKE-NEMO with the help of Bilinear Pairing Theorem. Handoff delay is reduced without compromising security strength. The whole experimentation of this proposed work is carried out using NS2 simulation tool and authentication proof is given using BAN logic between all the nodes in NEMO. The proposed security architecture is compared with related existing solutions and found to be more secure. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={In remote locations, the best way to establish a communication infrastructure is to deploy Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network over Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET). However, the node mobility and efficient cross-layer communication between the overlay and MANET routing protocols remains a challenge for reliable data transmission. In this paper, we propose a novel Mobility Aware Cross-layer Routing approach for Peer-to-Peer Networks (MACARON) over MANET. MACARON provides reliable communication and high lifetime routes to support efficient data transmission in the network. For this purpose, it uses cross-layer communications to share routing updates between MANET and overlay routing protocols. MACARON provides guaranteed routes with low path stretch by maintaining O˜(n) routing entries per node, where n is the number of nodes in the network. It provides scalability without using any landmark directory to store routing state, and it can effectively handle moderate mobility by using Last Encounter Routing (LER) protocol. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

Vibrational modes of rectangular diaphragm of piezoresistive pressure sensor have been determined at different frequencies for different pressure ranges. Optimal frequency range for particular applications for any diaphragm is a very important so that MEMS sensors performance should not degrade during the dynamic environment. Therefore, for the MEMS pressure sensor having applications in dynamic environment, the diaphragm frequency of 280 KHz has been optimized for the diaphragm thickness of 50 μm and hence this frequency can be considered for showing the better piezoresistive effect and high sensitivity. Moreover, the designed pressure sensor shows the high linearity and enhanced sensitivity of the order of (∼0.5066 mV/psi). © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={Wearable innovation has risen as a sharply debated issue in recent years around the world and the enthusiasm for this segment keeps on creating and will also overwhelm later on. This investigation work shows a multi-resonance monopole microstrip patch antenna for body wearable applications. The proposed antenna works at multi frequencies for GSM band 235 MHz (1754–1989 MHz), ISM band 561 MHz (2283–2844 MHz) and C band 545 MHz (5174–4629 MHz) covering all requirements of body-centric wireless communication using on-body wearable antennas. In particular, the designing and investigation are concentrated upon the performance of on-body and off-body wearable antenna in terms of multi-frequency operation. The performance of the proposed antenna is explored using equivalent four-layered phantom model of the human body as far as reflection coefficient, radiation pattern, electric field pattern, gain and current density, all outcomes are in great understanding. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.},

abstract={A, Mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) is collection of mobile devices that desire to communicate in the lack of any fixed infrastructure so, in this environment every mobile nodes works as a router in itself. In this type of wireless network, any node can leave or join network at any movement. Besides it this type of networks have some other challenging characteristics as regularly changing topology, high mobility, narrow bandwidth. Conventional routing protocols focused on finding shortest path rather than Quality of Service path. Link breakage is the main reason of high mobility as well as lack of energy of wireless nodes. In the lack of resources, traffic density leads to congestion. So, the performance of routing protocol degrades in this type of networks. But it is not so easy task to take multiple QoS parameters for finding optimal route. Mobile software agent technology with unique features like mobility, autonomous, intelligent and adaptability can solve this problem. This research paper focuses on designing routing model using mobile agent paradigm. The proposed model attempts to find more optimal path by considering multiple QoS parameters like stability, delay, congestion and energy of the node. Simulation is done using Matlab simulator the simulation output shows that our proposed model is more reliable than traditional hop by hop AODV for finding the route from source node to destination node. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={This study reports the instantaneous synthesis of stable silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) at room temperature using a digallate (DG) derivative linked through hydrophilic oxyethylene spacer. The DG derivative was synthesized using standard ester coupling reaction and employed for the production of AgNPs. The Digallate acted as a very strong reducing and stabilizing agent as it reduced Ag ions in an aqueous media into Ag nanoparticles (DG-AgNPs) instantaneously at room temperature. The DG-AgNPs were characterized by UV/Vis, XPS, XRD, HR-TEM, SEM, AFM, DLS and zeta potential measurements and were evaluated for their antibacterial potential against four different strains (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptomyces griseus and Bacillus subtilis). It demonstrated strong inhibitory activity with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) ranging from 4.0-6.0 μg/ml against all the tested bacterial strains. Optical density (OD) measurements and live/dead cell staining assay revealed significant antibacterial action of DG-AgNPs. The MTT based cytotoxicity, cellular morphology and nuclear staining analysis of NIH 3T3 cells (fibroblasts) suggested DG-AgNPs to be relatively safe as it did not reveal any growth inhibition for the optimized antibacterial concentrations. Concisely, relatively non-toxic AgNPs have been produced rapidly at room temperature using dimeric gallate and suggested as effective and promising antibacterial agent for pharmaceutical applications. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

abstract={Aspect Ratio (Depth/Width) is one of the most important factor to determine the quality of weld. For a weld to be a perfect one the Aspect Ratio should be maximum. Hence to get a perfect weld one has to ensure that the depth of penetration is good enough. In the current study we are optimizing the Nd-YAG welding system parameters (i.e. like laser peak power, pulse energy, welding speed, frequency) to get the best results on Brass and SS-316LN. Stainless Steel is one of the most widely used material at industry level and brass is already widely used in bearings, ammunition casing and for some electrical appliances. In this experiment the welding is being performed using TRUMPH HL- 506P Nd-YAG Laser Welding System and the welding speed is determined using a rotating mechanism to rotate the rod. The welds were inspected using metallography experiment and metallograph results were used to determine the Aspect Ratio.

abstract={Automatic trigger-word detection in speech is a well known technology nowadays. However, for people who are incapable of speech or are in some silence zone, such voice activated trigger detection systems find no use. We have developed a trigger detection system using the 24 static hand gestures of the American Sign Language (ASL). Our model is primarily based on Deep Convolutional Neural Network (Deep CNN) as they are capable of capturing interesting visual features at each hidden layer. We aim at constructing a customisable switch that can turn ‘on’ if it finds a given trigger gesture in any video that it receives and stays ‘off’ if it does not. The model was trained on images of various hand gestures in a multi-class classification setting. This allows the user to choose a custom trigger gesture for oneself. To test the efficiency of such a model in the trigger detection process, we have made 7,000 videos (each 10s long) consisting of random images from the test set which were never shown to the model during the training process. It is experimentally shown that such a system has a better performance than the other state-of-the art techniques used in static hand gesture image recognition tasks. This approach also finds real-time application and can be applied to develop small scale devices which trigger any particular response by capturing the gestures made by the people. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={In the current work, the effect of engine parameters on the performance of a diesel engine fuelled with diesel-biodiesel blend has been assessed. Homogeneous Reactor model (HRM) was utilized to compute the combustion parameters for a single cylinder diesel engine with unit aspect ratio and capacity of one-litre. The rate of pressure rise has a significant influence on the peak pressure generated, power produced and the degree of smooth transmittance of forces to the piston during the power stroke. The rate of pressure rise can be defined in terms of the crank angle increments since crank angle displacement is an indication of the engine speed. The pressure rise with respect to the crank angle increments were calculated based on three factors namely compression ratio, injection time and boost pressure that were selected for analysis of the diesel engine combustion at three significant levels. A L9 array was used to analyse the response of pressure-crank angle gradient "dp/dθ" as the output variable. From the Taguchi analysis of the effect of the three parameters, injection timing was the most dominant factor for the rise in the pressure gradient followed by boost pressure ratio and compression ratio as the lowest dominant factors. A contour of dp/dθ showed injection timing of 12° BTDC as the most optimum timing for maximum rise in pressure. © 2018 Penerbit Akademia Baru.},

abstract={Due to age-bound onset of symptoms used for diagnosis of mild to moderate intellectual disability, early diagnosis of these problems has long been a difficult issue. The diagnosis includes tests pertaining to intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviours including communication skills etc. In this paper, it is proposed to use speech features as an early indicator of the disorder which can be used to train machine learning algorithms for differentiating between speech of normally developing children and children with intellectual disability. In this paper, speech abnormalities are quantified using acoustic parameters including Linear Predictive Cepstral Coefficients, Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients and spectral features in speech samples of 48 participants (24 with intellectual disability and 24 age-matched controls). A training dataset was created by extracting these features which was used for learning by various classifiers. The experiments show promising results where Support Vector Machine gives an accuracy of 98%. Consequently, a well-trained classification algorithm can be used as an aid in early detection of mild to moderate intellectual disability. © 2018, 3D Research Center, Kwangwoon University and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={In this paper, a novel approach is developed for machine tool maintenance modelling considering fleet system architecture. The fleet system architecture consisting of different types of machine tools from various OEMs operated at different users, but supported by a single repair depot is considered. The prime objective of this paper is to jointly optimize the decisions of Level of Repair (LOR) i.e. repair/move/discard, and Preventive Maintenance (PM) schedules considering user's cost structure and shop floor policy parameters. It is observed that integrated PM and LOR approach gives better Life Cycle Cost (LCC) performance compared to isolated approaches. Also, the importance of user's cost structure and shop floor operations policy parameters in LOR and PM planning is evident from the results. The proposed approach is very useful for the machine tool manufacturers (i.e. OEM) who want to engage into long term maintenance contract with their customers. Integrating LOR and PM is a complex problem. The complexity further increases due to consideration of time dependent failure rate of the machine components, imperfect maintenance which brings partial restoration to the components/systems, and stochastic natures of model parameters. Consequently, a simulation based genetic algorithm approach is used to solve the problem. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Dielectrophoresis (DEP) devices have proven to be one of the most promising tools to transport, accumulate and sort various cells and particles. The major challenge in the development of DEP devices is the high cost, low yield using Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). In this paper, we demonstrate a facile, low-cost, and high-throughput method of constructing continuous-flow DEP devices using screen-printing technology. Much literature has concluded that the use of carbon electrodes provides more cost effective and more durable DEP devices than metal electrodes. More efficient devices not only need to be constructed from a low cost material but also from an inexpensive fabrication technique. In this study, we used yeast cells as model cells to perform a comparative study on trapping efficiency of carbon and gold electrode DEP devices. We have proposed, the sealing of carbon DEP device with glass, instead of PDMS, using adhesive bonding technique which not only reduce the leakage problem but also increases the device performance. We also report the biocompatibility analysis of carbon paste and the results indicates its usefulness in eventual studies involving carbon-MEMS devices. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The combined effects of electric and magnetic fields on peristaltic flow of Jeffery nanoliquids are analytically investigated. Double-diffusive convection in the asymmetric microchannel is also carried out. The walls of the microchannel are propagating with a finite phase difference in a sinusoidal manner. Rosseland diffusion flux model is employed to examine the thermal radiation effect. The zeta potential on the walls is considered very low to apply Hückel–Debye approximations. The coupled non-linear governing equations are simplified by using dimensional analysis and lubrication theory. The closed form solutions for potential function, nanoparticle fraction field, solute concentration field, temperature field, stream function, and axial velocity are derived under the appropriate boundary conditions. It is noteworthy that the pumping characteristics strongly depend on the magnetic fields, electric fields, electric double layer thickness, Jeffery parameter, thermal radiation and Grashof number. Furthermore, trapping phenomenon is analyzed under the effects of Hartmann number, Jeffrey parameter, Grashof number and Helmholtz–Smoluchowski velocity. The novelty of the present work is the amalgamation of biomimetics (peristaltic propulsion), electro-magneto-hydrodynamics and nanofluid dynamics to produce a smart pump system model for smart drug delivery systems. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={Software defined networking (SDN) is an emerging network paradigm which emphasizes the separation of the control plane from the data plane. This decoupling provides several advantages such as flexibility, programmability, and centralized control. However, SDN also introduces new vulnerabilities due to the required communication between data plane and control plane. Examples of threats that leverage such vulnerabilities are the control plane saturation and switch buffer overflow attacks. These attacks can be launched by flooding the TCP SYN packets from data plane (i.e., switches) to the control plane. This paper presents SAFETY, a novel solution for the early detection and mitigation of TCP SYN flooding. SAFETY harnesses the programming and wide visibility approach of SDN with entropy method to determine the randomness of the flow data. The entropy information includes destination IP and few attributes of TCP flags. To show the feasibility and effectiveness of SAFETY, we implement it as an extension module in Floodlight controller and evaluate it under different conditional scenarios. We run a thorough evaluation of our implementation through extensive emulation via Mininet. The experimental results show that when compared to the state-of-the-art, SAFETY brings a significant improvement (13%) regarding processing delay experienced by a legitimate node. Other parameters such as CPU utilization at the controller and attack detection time are also examined and shows improvement in various scenarios. © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Peristaltic micro-pumps offer an excellent mechanism for delivery of a variety of medicines including drugs, corneal solutions etc. The surge in deployment of nanoparticles in medicine has provided new potential for such pumps. In light of this we investigate the time-dependent peristaltic flow of nanofluids with diffusive effects through a finite non-uniform channel, this geometry being more representative of real micro-pumps. Creeping flow is taken into account (inertial forces are small compared with viscous forces) i.e., Reynolds number is low (Re <1) and wavelength is also taken to be very large. The Buongiorno formulation for nanofluids is employed with an Oberbeck-Boussinesq approximation. Closed-form solutions are developed for the non-dimensional governing equations subject to physically realistic boundary conditions. Mathematica symbolic software is employed to evaluate the evolution of nanoparticle fraction, temperature, axial velocity, transverse velocity and pressure difference distribution along the length of the pump channel with variation in thermal Grashof number, basic-density (species i.e., mass) Grashof number, Brownian motion parameter and thermophoresis parameter. © 2018, China Ship Scientific Research Center.},

abstract={Genetic factors play a critical role in the development of human diseases. Recently, several molecular genetic studies have provided multiple lines of evidence for a critical role of genetic factors in the expression of human bladder exstrophy-epispadias complex (BEEC). At this point, ISL1 (ISL LIM homeobox 1) has emerged as the major susceptibility gene for classic bladder exstrophy (CBE), in a multifactorial disease model. Here, GWAS (Genome wide association studies) discovery and replication studies, as well as the re-sequencing of ISL1, identified sequence variants (rs9291768, rs6874700, c.137C > G (p.Ala46Gly)) associated with CBE. Here, we aimed to determine the molecular and functional consequences of these sequence variants and estimate the dependence of ISL1 protein on other predicted candidates. We used: (i) computational analysis of conserved sequence motifs to perform an evolutionary conservation analysis, based on a Bayesian algorithm, and (ii) computational 3D structural modeling. Furthermore, we looked into long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) residing within the ISL1 region, aiming to predict their targets. Our analysis suggests that the ISL1 protein specific N-terminal LIM domain (which harbors the variant c.137C>G), limits its transcriptional ability, and might interfere with ISL1-estrogen receptor α interactions. In conclusion, our analysis provides further useful insights about the ISL1 gene, which is involved in the formation of the BEEC, and in the development of the urinary bladder. © 2018 by the authors.

The advent of fabric sensors with discernible and steady response have opened a new avenue for classifying physical activity of humans. Our goal is to construct a smart jacket for human activity/posture classification and to apply machine learning models on the fabric sensor reading to predict physical events. The core concept is in placing stretch sensors, pressure sensors and accelerometer at strategic location to collect the responses. The sensor's response is studied toidentify linearity and repeatability, using which, reliability of data is determined. Further, appropriate Machine learning algorithms can be employed to classify different set of activities. It also important to follow a proper procedure to record data from fabric sensors which create a voltage fluctuation when stretched.

abstract={The addition of polymer to injection fluid increases the crude oil recovery by improved sweep efficiency. Although it is the most widely used method for chemical enhanced oil recovery (CEOR), limitations such as lower stability of the polymer under reservoir conditions hinder the efficiency of the process. In the current study, a novel nanoparticle assisted polymer flooding approach was carried out to overcome these limitations. To determine whether nanoparticles influence the displacement efficiency of the injected fluid, we used a blend of xanthan gum and nickel nanoparticles. We have evaluated the changes in the dilute solution viscosity of xanthan when the nickel nanoparticles are added and have found out that a xanthan-nickel nanoparticles mixture has a higher intrinsic viscosity of 55.25 dL/g compared to 49.13 dL/g for the gum solution. Efficiency of nanoparticle assisted polymer flooding was evaluated in sand packed bioreactors with ∼0.6 PV of residual oil in place (ROIP). Flooding results demonstrated the highest recovery of 5.98% of additional ROIP with xanthan-nickel nanoparticle mixture compared to 4.48 and 4.58% of ROIP during the separate flooding of xanthan and nanoparticles, respectively. Results suggested the novel nanoparticle assisted polymer flooding approach is able to increase oil recovery beyond available methods. © 2018 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={There has been a developing enthusiasm for programmed human statistic estimation i.e., Age, sexual orientation scare, marks, tattoos and race from unconstrained facial pictures because of an assortment of potential applications in law requirement, security control, and human-PC cooperation. Bounteous writing has explored the issue of computerized age, sexual orientation, and race acknowledgement from unconstrained facial pictures. Nonetheless, in spite of the concurrence of this component, a large portion of the investigations have tended to them independently, next to no consideration has been given to their connections. Programmed statistic estimation remains a testing issue since people having a place with a similar statistic gathering can be tremendously unique in their facial appearances because of natural and extraneous elements. This paper shows a non-exclusive system for the programmed statistic (age. sexual orientation and race) estimation. The proposed approach comprises of the accompanying three principal stages.

abstract={Climate change and global warming have a destabilizing effect on the global environment, and governmental statutory bodies are emphasizing a reduction of emission coupled with restoration of degraded forest lands as a carbon sequestration–emission reduction (REDD+) initiative. Asphyxiated mangrove soil, existing on the borderline of land and sea, has the highest potential to trap ‘blue carbon’; hence, plantation programs have been initiated around the tropical coasts to restore this unique habitat. This case study provides a cost–benefit and carbon sequestration analysis for planting of five mangrove species (Avicennia marina, Bruguiera sexangula, Ceriops tagal, Rhizophora mucronata and Xylocarpus moluccensis) by various methods in a 102.4-ha area at the Indian Sundarbans. It is estimated that as per the planting methods used in the current study and physio-chemical properties of the sediment, coupled with other local factors such as anthropogenic interventions, Avicennia marina planting by the ‘propagule dibbling’ method is the most cost effective (0.002 Euro/survived plant), with the highest increment (97%) in organic carbon density (OCD), humic acid (100.86%) and fulvic acid (48.78%) over a period of 5 years. Survival rate was highest (82%) for Avicennia marina, planted by the ‘transplanting of nursery-grown seedlings’ method. The drain and trench method resulted in a 55% survival rate for Rhizophora mucronata, but the extra labor investment made this the costliest method (0.13 Euro/survived plant) and also less carbon effective (only 85% increment of OCD in 5 years). Planting methods, sediment quality, tidal inundation and salinity variations can play a major role in blue carbon burial/sequestration in mangrove lands. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Automated segmentation and dermoscopic hair detection are one of the significant challenges in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) of melanocytic lesions. Additionally, due to the presence of artifacts and variation in skin texture and smooth lesion boundaries, the accuracy of such methods gets hampered. The objective of this research is to develop an automated hair detection and lesion segmentation algorithm using lesion-specific properties to improve the accuracy. The aforementioned objective is achieved in two ways. Firstly, a novel hair detection algorithm is designed by considering the properties of dermoscopic hair. Second, a novel chroma-based geometric deformable model is used to effectively differentiate the lesion from the surrounding skin. The speed function incorporates the chrominance properties of the lesion to stop evolution at the lesion boundary. Automatic initialization of the initial contour and chrominance-based speed function aids in providing robust and flexible segmentation. The proposed approach is tested on 200 images from PH2 and 900 images from ISBI 2016 datasets. Average accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and overlap scores of 93.4, 87.6, 95.3, and 11.52% respectively are obtained for the PH2 dataset. Similarly, the proposed method resulted in average accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and overlap scores of 94.6, 82.4, 97.2, and 7.20% respectively for the ISBI 2016 dataset. Statistical and quantitative analyses prove the reliability of the algorithm for incorporation in CAD systems.

abstract={Electrokinetic peristaltic multi-layered transport is considered in a micro-channel under the action of an axial electrical field. Three different layers i.e. the core layer, intermediate layer and peripheral layer are simulated with three different viscosities for each fluid layer. The unsteady two-dimensional conservation equations for mass and momentum with electrokinetic body forces, are transformed from the wave frame to the laboratory frame and the electrical field terms are rendered into electrical potential terms via the Poisson–Boltzmann equation, Debye length approximation and ionic Nernst–Planck equation. The dimensionless emerging linearized electrokinetic boundary value problem is solved using integral methods. Closed-form expressions are derived for stream functions in the core, intermediate and peripheral layers. Expressions are also derived for the core–intermediate interface shape and the intermediate–peripheral interface shape. Maximum pressures are also computed. To study bolus migration, the range of the trapping limit is also determined in the peripheral layer. It is found that in the core layer larger boluses are computed in the case of lower intermediate layer viscosity relative to peripheral layer viscosity although the number of boluses is greater when the intermediate layer viscosity exceeds the peripheral layer viscosity. Furthermore, in the intermediate layer, stronger concentration of streamlines is computed in the lower half space with positive Helmholtz–Smoluchowski velocity. Also negative Helmholtz–Smoluchowski velocity reduces the core layer (H 1 ) interface shape whereas it enhances the peripheral layer (H) and intermediate layer (H 2 ) shapes. At lower values of volume flow rate ratio, hydromechanical efficiency is maximum for positive Helmholtz–Smoluchowski velocity whether intermediate layer viscosity is less or greater than peripheral layer viscosity. Finally, greater with greater peristaltic wave amplitude and also for positive Helmholtz–Smoluchowski velocity there is an increase in time-averaged flow rate, whether intermediate layer viscosity is less or greater than peripheral layer viscosity. The analysis is relevant to electro-kinetic hemodynamics and bio-micro-fluidics. © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS},

abstract={Synthesis of mono-crystalline Ga2O3 Nanorods was done by sol-gel transformation of gallium(III) isopropoxide (Ga(OPri)3). XRD studies were done to determine the planes and crystal structure of synthesized nanorods that showed the synthesis of β-Ga2O3 (a). TEM studies of synthesized Ga2O3 confirmed the synthesis of monocrystalline β-Ga2O3 nanorods. To study the effect of precursor chemistry and to determine role of precursor structures on the crystal structure, phase and morphology of the Ga2O3, a new modified precursor complex was synthesized. The reaction of Ga(OPri)3 with N-phenylsalicylaldimine, [C6H4(OH)CH=N(C6H5)] in 1:1 M ratio yielded [{(H5C6)N = CH-C6H4O}Ga(OPri)2]. The newly synthesized complex was characterized by elemental analyses, molecular weight measurement, FT-IR and NMR (1H and 13C) spectral studies. Spectral studies of the modified complex suggest the presence of bi-dentate mode of attachment of Schiff's base in the solution state. Sol-gel transformations of [{(H5C6)N = CH-C6H4O}Ga(OPri)2] in organic medium, yielded γ-Ga2O3(b), as found by XRD studies. TEM image of the sample (a) revealed the formation of nano-rods of oxide with average diameter of ~100 nm whereas the TEM image of sample (b) showed presence of nano-sized particles of oxide with average particle size of 10 nm. Morphological and compositional studies of synthesized samples (a) and (b) were carried out using SEM and EDX. The method provides a possibility of large scale synthesis of dissimilar shaped and pure Ga2O3 nanoparticles. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.},

abstract={This work explains the behavior of differential drive mobile robot in tracing the source of a chemical emission. Results are simulation based carried out for an indoor environment with source emitting chemical at varying release rates. Robot is able to navigate by sensing the plume concentration in omnidirectional regions without air flow information. The study is based on robot behavior in pursuit of a chemical source while the environment sampling rate and robot surge distances are intertwined. Changes in surge distances are facilitated by predefining number of steps and different wheel speeds which varies from 0.5v to 2.5v where v is 0.3605 m/s in real scenario. Robot with a predefined wheel speed takes minimum one step and maximum up to six steps after which the environmental conditions change. For a single step and a predefined wheel speed, 100 simulations were performed. There are five different wheel speeds to be tested for a step size hence 500 simulations are recorded. So with different combinations of step size varying from one to six with five different wheel speeds produces 3000 simulations. Results are compiled on the basis of elapsed time, distance covered as well as the success rate of robot if it takes the predefined steps and wheel speed for completion of said task. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Understanding molecular properties of outer membrane channels of Gram-negative bacteria is of fundamental significance as they are the entry point of polar antibiotics into bacteria. Outer membrane proteomics revealed OccK8 (OprE) to be among the five most expressed substrate specific channels of the clinically important Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The high-resolution X-ray structure and electrophysiology highlighted a very narrow pore. However, experimental in vitro methods showed the transport of natural amino acids and antibiotics, among them ceftazidime. We used molecular dynamics simulations to reveal the importance of the physicochemical properties of ceftazidime in modulating the translocation through OccK8, proposing a structure-function relationship. As in general porins, the internal electric field favors the translocation of polar molecules by gainful energy compensation in the central constriction region. Importantly, the comparatively narrow OccK8 pore can undergo a substrate-induced expansion to accommodate relatively large-sized substrates. © 2018 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={The research works in Handwritten Devanagari Characters are continually evolving into new challenges, which exposed the new sources of further research work like, character normalization, gray-level normalization, a discrimination of the similar characters and many more. This paper discusses the discrimination of the similar characters, which is one of the major sources of classification error. The similar shape character has a very minute difference, which is called critical region and used to discriminate them by human beings. The primary goal of the current work is to identify the critical region of the similar character and use the same to generate additional features in order to minimize the classification errors in the end results. It is also quite challenging to identify the critical region as the characters are written in different handwriting styles and fonts. The paper suggestes the Fisher linear discriminant model to detect the critical region, which is used to extract the additional feature. The experiments work was conducted on the standard database, which has 36172 handwritten Devanagari characters and significant improvement has been recorded by the aforesaid technique. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={Abstract: Here we report, for the first time, development of nanocellulose based novel bio-nanocomposite injectable hydrogel scaffold. An integrated approach has been used to incorporate ultrafine fluorcanasite (FC) glass-ceramic particulates within nanocellulose matrix, synthesized from lignocellulosic biomass. Epichlorohydrin (ECH) was used as a chemical cross-linking agent for hydrogel synthesis. The compositions and properties of bio-nanocomposite hydrogels were controlled by varying the loading of FC and ECH. Moreover, microstructural characterizations and functional group analysis of synthesized nanocellulose and bio-nanocomposite hydrogels were carried out using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). SEM studies revealed successful extraction of cellulosic nanofibres and interconnected porous micro-architecture of injectable hydrogels. Incorporation of FC particulates resulted into development of well-defined micro-porous morphology. FT-IR studies indicated the presence of hydroxyl groups and possible interactions between nanocellulose and FC reinforcements. The rheological study of the developed injectable hydrogel was carried out at different frequency, amplitude and temperature sweeps. The studies revealed that after the incorporation of FC, dynamic storage modulus increased, while synergistically enhancing the injectability of the bio-nanocomposite hydrogels. An optimum loading level of FC reinforcement could also be established. Swelling behaviour studies of the hydrogels demonstrated higher degree of swelling and enhanced structural integrity with incorporation of FC. The novel bio-nanocomposite injectable hydrogels developed in this study, could demonstrate promising potential as injectable implant material.

abstract={This article addresses the electrokinetically modulated biomechanical transport through a two-dimensional asymmetric microchannel induced by peristaltic waves. Electrokinetic transport with peristaltic phenomena grabbed a significant attention due to its novel applications in engineering. Electrical fields also provide an excellent mode for regulating flows. The electrohydrodynamics problem is modified by means of Debye–Hückel linearization. Firstly, the governing flow problem is described by continuity and momentum equations in the presence of electrokinetic forces in Cartesian coordinates, then long wavelength and low/zero Reynolds (“neglecting the inertial forces”) approximations are applied to modify the governing flow problem. The resulting differential equations are solved analytically in order to obtain exact solutions for velocity profile whereas the numerical integration is carried out to analyze the pumping characteristics. The physical behaviour of sundry parameters is discussed for velocity profile, pressure rise and volume flow rate. In particular, the behaviour of electro-osmotic parameter, phase difference, and Helmholtz–Smoluchowski velocity is examined and discussed. The trapping mechanism is also visualized by drawing streamlines against the governing parameters. The present study offers various interesting results that warrant further study on electrokinetic transport with peristalsis. © 2018, Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science.},

abstract={Bitcoin is a popular cryptocurrency that records all transactions in a distributed append-only public ledger called blockchain. The security of Bitcoin heavily relies on the incentive-compatible proof-of-work (PoW) based distributed consensus protocol, which is run by the network nodes called miners. In exchange for the incentive, the miners are expected to maintain the blockchain honestly. Since its launch in 2009, Bitcoin economy has grown at an enormous rate, and it is now worth about 150 billions of dollars. This exponential growth in the market value of bitcoins motivate adversaries to exploit weaknesses for profit, and researchers to discover new vulnerabilities in the system, propose countermeasures, and predict upcoming trends. In this paper, we present a systematic survey that covers the security and privacy aspects of Bitcoin. We start by giving an overview of the Bitcoin system and its major components along with their functionality and interactions within the system. We review the existing vulnerabilities in Bitcoin and its major underlying technologies such as blockchain and PoW-based consensus protocol. These vulnerabilities lead to the execution of various security threats to the standard functionality of Bitcoin. We then investigate the feasibility and robustness of the state-of-the-art security solutions. Additionally, we discuss the current anonymity considerations in Bitcoin and the privacy-related threats to Bitcoin users along with the analysis of the existing privacy-preserving solutions. Finally, we summarize the critical open challenges, and we suggest directions for future research towards provisioning stringent security and privacy solutions for Bitcoin. © 1998-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={An Exponential growth of the high-speed internet has resulted in the rapid growth in online marketing. Online shopping provides the services to online shoppers as well as walk-in shoppers. However, security is the main concern in e-commerce in order to safeguard the confidential information, from online fraud, i.e. credit card or debit card fraud, leakage of information by the merchant or bank when a card is not used in online transaction etc. This paper proposed the two-way authentication technique modeled around visual cryptography and steganography techniques to protect the e-commerce fraud. The technique provides better security in term of authentication, identity theft and data transfer. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Energy efficiency is an important issue in wireless sensor networks; clustering of nodes and sensor data aggregation are popular techniques to address the issue. Sensors generate sensitive data in many applications and thus methods to secure the data so as to prevent easy access by unauthorized agents are essential. Security against false data injection or data tampering can be provided through encryption of sensor data; but it increases load on processing. Securing data, however, puts a burden on the node battery. Data aggregation aims both at data reduction so as to spend less time for encryption as well as reduce transmission load, but demanding additional processing at aggregating node. Thus, aggregation and security are contradictory solutions. The dilemma can be resolved by allowing targeted malleability of encrypted data through homomorphic encryption. The recent research works recommend schemes which use homomorphic MACs, signatures and a blend of private and public cryptography to achieve the purpose. This paper proposes a generalized framework which will be more secure in aspects of secure data aggregation and security of data which include the data privacy and detection of tampering data through homomorphic primitive. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Terahertz (THz) radiations focused at multiple positions are quite useful for their medical application. For this, we propose to employ beating of dark hollow Gaussian laser beams (DHGBs) of different beam orders in plasma. In view of realistic situations, we also include the collisions between the electrons and the neutrals. Because of a special intensity gradient distribution in DHGBs, the emitted THz radiation is found to have a unique field profile with multiple focii. The dependence of plasma density, order of the beams and collision frequency on the THz field amplitude is discussed. The important feature to consider hollow Gaussian laser beams is having the same power at different beam orders. It is found that the amplitude of the emitted radiation is highly sensitive to the beam order of the incident lasers. An optimization of the plasma parameters and the lasers characteristics can lead to the enhancement in the THz intensity and the efficiency of the mechanism. © CopyrightEPLA, 2018.},

abstract={Electrokinetic transport of fluids through microchannels by micro-pumping and micro- peristaltic pumping has stimulated considerable interest in biomedical engineering and other areas of medical technology. Deeper elucidation of the fluid dynamics of such transport requires the continuous need for more elegant mathematical models and numerical simulations, in parallel with laboratory investigations. In this article we therefore investigate analytically the unsteady viscous flow driven by the combined effects of peristalsis and electro-osmosis through microchannel. An integral number of waves propagating in the microchannel are considered as a model for transportation of fluid bolus along the channel length. Debye-Hückel linearization is employed to evaluate the potential function. Low Reynolds number and large wavelength approximations are employed. Closed-form solutions are derived for the non-dimensional boundary value problem. The computations demonstrate that magnitude of electric potential function is increased with a decrease in the thickness of the electrical double layer (EDL). Stronger electric field also decelerates the flow and decreases local wall shear stress. Hydrodynamic pressure is increased with EDL thickness whereas it is suppressed with electric field. Streamline visualization reveals that the quantity of trapped bolus is decreased with increase in EDL thickness and also with higher external electric field. © 2017 Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University},

abstract={To sustain the adequate bandwidth demands over rapidly growing multimedia traffic and considering the effectiveness of Information-Centric Networking (ICN), recently, HTTP based Dynamic Adaptive Streaming (DASH) has been introduced over ICN, which significantly increases the network bandwidth utilisation. However, we identified that the inherent features of ICN also causes new vulnerabilities in the network. In this paper, we first propose a novel attack called as Bitrate Oscillation Attack (BOA), which exploits fundamental ICN characteristics: in-network caching and interest aggregation, to disrupt DASH functionality. In particular, the proposed attack forces the bitrate and resolution of video received by the attacked client to oscillate with high frequency and high amplitude during the streaming process. To detect and mitigate BOA, we design and implement a reactive countermeasure called Fair-RTT-DAS. Our solution ensures efficient bandwidth utilisation and improves the user perceived Quality of Experience (QoE) in the presence of varying content source locations. For this purpose, Fair-RTT-DAS consider DASH's two significant features: round-trip-time (RTT) and throughput fairness. In the presence of BOA in a network, our simulation results show an increase in the annoyance factor in user's spatial dimension, i.e., increase in oscillation frequency and amplitude. The results also show that our countermeasure significantly alleviates these adverse effects and makes dynamic adaptive streaming friendly to ICN's implicit features. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

The results are compared with base line diesel operation at 180 bar standard injection pressure. The experimental results show better engine performance and exhaust emission characteristics for the biofuel blends at 220 bar injection pressure. Biofuel blend B20M10 gives better performance and emission results when compared to B30M10, and there is not much difference in the results when compared to B10M10. B20M10 blend gives slightly lower brake thermal efficiency (BTE), sharp reduction in carbon monoxide (CO), unburnt hydrocarbon (HC) and smoke emissions and drastic increase in oxides of nitrogen emissions (NOx), when compared to baseline diesel operation. ©, Copyright Association of Energy Engineers (AEE).},

abstract={A mathematical model to analyze the effects of electric double layer and applied external electric field on peristaltic transport of non-Newtonian aqueous solution through a microchannel is presented. Ostwald–de Waele power law model is employed to describe the non-Newtonian fluid, in an effort to capture the essential biofluid dynamics. The governing equations of physical problem are simplified using low Reynolds number and long wavelength approximations. Poisson Boltzmann equations are also solved under Debye Hückel linearization. Following non-dimensional transformation of the linearized boundary value problem, closed-form analytical solutions are presented for the velocity components, pressure gradient, average flow rate, and stream function subject to physically appropriate boundary conditions. Validation with existing results is also made. A comparative discussion between shear thinning fluid and shear thickening fluids under the influences of Debye length and Helmholtz–Smoluchowski velocity are presented numerically. Trapping phenomenon for dilatant fluids and pseudoplastic fluids under the electrokinetic phenomenon is also computed. This model can help toward designing artificial biomedical devices based on microfluidic devices which can also be applicable to control the physiological transport. © 2018, The Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering.},

abstract={Early rapid detection of Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) bacilli in milk samples is the major challenge since traditional culture method is time consuming and laboratory dependent. We report a simple, sensitive and specific nano-technology based ‘Nano-immuno test’ capable of detecting viable MAP bacilli in the milk samples within 10 h. Viable MAP bacilli were captured by MAP specific antibody-conjugated magnetic nano-particles using resazurin dye as chromogen. Test was optimized using true culture positive (10-bovine and 12-goats) and true culture negative (16-bovine and 25-goats) raw milk samples. Domestic livestock species in India are endemically infected with MAP. After successful optimization, sensitivity and specificity of the ‘nano-immuno test’ in goats with respect to milk culture was 91.7% and 96.0%, respectively. Whereas, it was 90.0% (sensitivity) and 92.6% (specificity) with respect to IS900 PCR. In bovine milk samples, sensitivity and specificity of ‘nano-immuno test’ with respect to milk culture was 90.0% and 93.7%, respectively. However, with respect to IS900 PCR, the sensitivity and specificity was 88.9% and 94.1%, respectively. Test was validated with field raw milk samples (goats-258 and bovine-138) collected from domestic livestock species to detect live/viable MAP bacilli. Of 138 bovine raw milk samples screened by six diagnostic tests, 81 (58.7%) milk samples were positive for MAP infection in one or more than one diagnostic tests. Of 81 (58.7%) positive bovine raw milk samples, only 24 (17.4%) samples were detected positive for the presence of viable MAP bacilli. Of 258 goats raw milk samples screened by six diagnostic tests, 141 (54.6%) were positive for MAP infection in one or more than one test. Of 141 (54.6%) positive raw milk samples from goats, only 48 (34.0%) were detected positive for live MAP bacilli. Simplicity and efficiency of this novel ‘nano-immuno test’ makes it suitable for wide-scale screening of milk samples in the field. Standardization, validation and re-usability of functionalized nano-particles and the test was successfully achieved in field samples. Test was highly specific, simple to perform and easy to read by naked eyes and does not require laboratory support in the performance of test. Test has potential to be used as screening test to estimate bio-load of MAP in milk samples at National level. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Palladium complexes of phosphine free pincer based ligands are currently growing credence as efficient catalysts for C–C cross-coupling reaction under environmentally benign and mild reaction conditions. A series of new palladium complexes 2 a–2 c supported by 2,6-bis(pyrrolyl)pyridine based [NNN]-pincer ligands have been synthesized, and their catalytic activities for Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction were examined. The palladium complexes (2 a–2 c) were synthesized by the reaction of 2,6-bis(pyrrolyl)pyridine ligands (LH2) with Pd(OAc)2 in acetonitrile as a solvent. Electrochemical studies of complexes 2 a–2 c showed two prominent oxidation peaks, which were ascribed to the dianionic pyrrolide ligand and an oxidation peak that can be ascribed to palladium metal center. There is an exhibition of well-coordinated metal directed oxidation of the complexes which indicates a well-established electronic network. Computational studies on complexes 2 a–2 c further supported the experimental observations. These palladium complexes 2 a–2 c can efficiently catalyze Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction of aryl bromides in an aqueous medium. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim},

abstract={In a magnetized inhomogeneous plasmas, usual version of the KdV equation is found to modify by presence of charged dust grains. The density gradient in the plasma shows its dependence on the recombination rate, ion to electron temperature ratio, obliqueness of the magnetic field and the drift velocity of the ions. In the said plasma, only the compressive solitary structures are found to propagate corresponding to two different types of modes. A significant effect of magnetic field and charged dust grains is found on these structures, though these structures show weak dependence on the ionization rate of neutral atoms. Interestingly the solitons with prominent tailing structures are evolved in the plasma under the effect of stronger density gradient and higher recombination. © 2018 Author(s).},

abstract={When hydrogen burns in air, it produces nothing but water vapour. It is therefore the cleanest possible, totally non-polluting fuel. This fact has led some people to propose an energy economy based entirely on hydrogen, in which hydrogen would replace gasoline, oil, natural gas, coal, and nuclear power. Hydrogen is a clean energy source. Therefore, in recent years, demand on hydrogen production has increased considerably. Electrolysis of water, steam reforming of hydrocarbons and auto-thermal processes are well-known methods for hydrogen gas production, but not cost-effective due to high energy requirements. As compare to chemical methods, biological production of hydrogen gas has significant advantages such as bio-photolysis of water by algae, dark and photo-fermentation of organic materials, usually carbohydrates by bacteria. New approach for bio-hydrogen production is dark and photo-fermentation process but with some major problems like dark and photo-fermentative hydrogen production is the raw material cost. By using suitable bio-process technologies hydrogen can be produced through carbohydrate rich, nitrogen deficient solid wastes such as cellulose and starch containing agricultural and food industry wastes and some food industry wastewaters such as cheese whey, olive mill and baker's yeast industry wastewaters. Utilization of aforementioned wastes for hydrogen production provides inexpensive energy generation with simultaneous waste treatment. This review article summarizes bio-hydrogen production from some waste materials with recent developments and relative advantages. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.},

abstract={Over recent years, cognitive radio technology has been paid enormous attention as this innovatory communication archetype can utilize existing wireless spectrum resources more competently. Spectrum sensing is considered to be primary and most essential task for cognitive radio network operators. It has been acknowledged that cooperative spectrum sensing improves the overall sensing performance of the network. But selfish users be likely to act greedily to access the channel without involving in spectrum sensing. In this paper, we considered multiuser de-centralized cooperative spectrum sensing scenario and game theory is used to analyze the cognitive interaction process. A comprehensive expression is derived for throughput and it is, then, maximized through strategic interaction between cognitive users. Simulation result shows that taking part in sensing is not always good in terms of throughput. This work also evaluates network conditions to determine when to contribute in sensing to maximize throughput. © 2018 Elsevier GmbH},

abstract={Oilfields located in western India produce crude by injection of large amounts of water during secondary oil recovery. This water is obtained from underground aquifer and contains 5 mM sulfate approximately. Sulfate present in this water is converted in to sulfide by sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) present in the reservoir. Increased concentration of sulfide in the production fluid negatively impacts oil production and is known as reservoir souring. Most probable number and quantitative PCR enumerated 103-108 SRB ml−1 in various field installations. Isolates from produced water in sulfate containing medium showed similarity with Desulfotomaculum, Desulfomicrobium and Thermodesulfobacterium genera. Similarly, isolates from produced water in nitrate containing medium were related to Tepidiphilus, Paenibacillaceae, Kocuria and Thauera genera. In the present study four sand packed bioreactors simulating moderately high temperature oil reservoir were used for different souring control treatments. Results revealed that continuous injection of 4 mM nitrate or 1.5 mM benzalkonium chloride (BAC) was not able to control souring. However, co-injection of 2 mM nitrate and 0.75 mM BAC completely ceased sulfide production and controlled souring. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

Synthesised AgNPs were characterised by scanning electron microscope and high-resolution transmission electron microscope. The size of synthesised AgNPs was in the range of 20-40 nm having spherical morphology. The AgNPs were found to show antimicrobial activity against bacteria such as Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), and Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213).},

abstract={A mathematical model is presented to analyze the unsteady peristaltic flow of magnetized viscoelastic fluids through a deformable curved channel. The study simulates the bio-inspired pumping of electroconductive rheological polymers which possess both electroconductive and viscoelastic properties. The Jeffrey viscoelastic model is utilized which features both relaxation and retardation terms of relevance to real polymers. A magnetic body force is incorporated for the influence of static radial magnetic field. The mass and momentum conservation equations are formulated in an intrinsic coordinate system and transformed with appropriate variables into a nondimensional system between the wave and the laboratory frames, under lubrication (i.e., low Reynolds number and long wavelength) approximations. Kinematic and no-slip boundary conditions are imposed at the channel walls. A magnetic body force is incorporated for the influence of static radial magnetic field in the primary momentum equation. An analytic approach is employed to determine closed-form solutions for stream function, axial pressure gradient, and volumetric flow rate. Spatiotemporal plots for pressure distribution along the channel (passage) length are presented to study the influences of curvature parameter, relaxation-to-retardation time ratio (Jeffrey first viscoelastic parameter) and Hartmann number (magnetic field parameter). The effects of these parameters on radial velocity distributions are also visualized. Cases of trapping and reflux in a curved channel are discussed. Streamline distributions are included to study trapping phenomena and to investigate more closely the impact of curvature, magnetic field, and viscoelastic properties on bolus evolution. The reflux or retrograde motion of the particles is studied by particle advection based on Lagrangian viewpoint. The simulations provide new insight into the mechanisms of pumping of electroconductive non-Newtonian liquids in realistic geometries. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={A range of bio-nanocomposites were prepared by incorporation of organo modified montmorillonite nanoclay (OMMT) with or without use of aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)3) within polylactic acid (PLA) solution. Furthermore, the solution was employed for modification of ligno-cellulosic (jute) fabric structural reinforcements. The successful incorporation of nanofillers within the host polymer, polylactic acid (PLA) was confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Water uptake and swelling behaviour studies revealed that the water uptake and swelling ratio of bio-composites reduced significantly as compared to pristine jute fabric, whereas upon incorporation of OMMT and Al(OH)3, the water barrier properties reduced even further in the developed bio-nanocomposites. The flexural strength of the bio-nanocomposites also showed improved mechanical and dimensional stability. Synergistic effects of OMMT and Al(OH)3 were observed in enhancing the aforementioned physico-mechanical properties. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies revealed microstructural details of developed samples. Similarly, the thermo-gravimetric analysis and linear burning rate studies of Al(OH)3treated bio-nanocomposite materials revealed enhanced thermal resistance and reduced flammability respectively compared to both pristine woven jute fabric and fabrics treated with PLA alone or those without Al(OH)3. From the above results it can safely be said that the bio-nanocomposite material can be a prospective candidate for development of flame retardant biopackaging. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The present study analyzes the heat energy transfer in nano u- ids ow through the porous stretching surface. Cattanneo-Christov heat ux model is employed to study the heat energy transfer. Darcy law is used to dis- cuss the ow characteristics over the different types of permeable sheets with suction and injection. Nano uids is considered as water based single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) nano uids. A comparative study for SWCNT and MWCNT is also made. Governing equations are transformed into set of ordinary differential equations using similarity transformations. The computational results are obtained by using Runge-Kutta fourth order method along with shooting technique. Nu- merical and graphical results are presented to discuss the effects of various physical parameters on velocity profile, temperature profile, Nusselt number, Sherwood number and skin friction coeficient for different type of nanoparti- cles for suction and injection cases. Stream lines and isotherms are also plotted for three different cases viz. permeable sheet with suction, impermeable sheet and permeable sheet with injection. A comparative analysis with existing re- sults is tabulated which validate that the numerical results of present study have good correlation with existing results. The outcomes of the results show that skin friction coeficient is more for SWCNT in caparison of MWCNT and the boundary layer thickness is maximum for permeable stretching sheet with suction parameter.},

abstract={Nanofluid dynamics with magnetohydrodynamics has tremendously contributed in industrial applications recently since presence of nanoparticle in base fluids enhances the specific chemical and physical properties. Owing to the relevance of nanofluid dynamics, we analyze the nanofluid flow in the presence of gyrotactic microorganism and magnetohydrodynamics through a stretching/shrinking plate. The impacts of chemical reaction and thermal radiation on flow characteristics are also studied. To simplify the governing equations of microorganisms, velocity, concentration and temperature, the similarity transformations are employed. The couple governing equations are numerically solved using Successive Taylor Series Linearization Method (STSLM). The velocity profile, motile microorganism density profile, concentration profile, temperature profile as well as Nusselt number, skin friction coefficient, Sherwood number and density number of motile microorganisms are discussed using tables and graphs against all the sundry parameters. A numerical comparison is also given for Nusselt number, Sherwood number, skin friction, and density number of motile microorganisms with previously published results to validate the present model. The results show that Nusselt number, Sherwood number and density number diminish with increasing the magnetic field effects. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={This paper presents result analysis of K-Mediod algorithm, implemented on Hadoop Cluster by using Map-Reduce concept. Map-Reduce are programming models which authorize the managing of huge datasets in parallel, on a large number of devices. It is especially well suited to constant or moderate changing set of data since the implementation point of a position is usually high. MapReduce is supposed to be framework of 'big data'. The MapReduce model authorizes for systematic and instant organizing of large scale data with a cluster of evaluate nodes. One of the primary affect in Hadoop is how to minimize the completion length (i.e., make span) of a set of MapReduce duty. For various applications like word count, grep, terasort and parallel K-Mediod Clustering Algorithm, it has been observed that as the number of node increases, execution time decreases. In this paper we verified Map Reduce applications and found as the amount of nodes increases the completion time decreases. © 2017 IEEE.},

Forces which are considered weak in macro world like Van der Waals, electrostatic interactions, Brownian are seen playing significant role in the motion of particle at nanoscale. The importance of stiffness in Brownian motion for a nanoparticle had been established and published in literature. It is observed that when a particle has low stiffness it tends to behave differently from its stiffer counterparts. Present work investigates the significance of near zero value of stiffness on variance in motion of nanoparticle with the help of simulations in MATLAB.

abstract={One of the vital application of Emergency Ad hoc Networks is to establish communication between those affected by emergency situation and responders providing services. In most such cases, the conventional communication infrastructure such as wired and cellular networks get damaged and therefore cannot provide communication required to exchange emergency information. Therefore, to cope with such disasters in a fast and coordinated way, the optimal provisioning of the emergency information is crucial. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) are the paramount components for such situations. UAVs can act as mobile base stations and facilitate wireless communication to connect to nearest working telephone network access point. A large scale disaster information system can be formed by combining UAV network with existing available network regardless of some of network lines being damaged and destroyed. In this paper, we have designed a prototype of UAV assisted emergency ad hoc network (EANET). We have also evaluated and compared AODV and ZRP routing protocols by varying the number of UAV assisted EANET nodes in different transmission range cases of disaster scenarios. The experimental results illustrate that ZRP is the most appropriate protocol for emergency situations. © 2017 IEEE.},

A major challenge to realize nanoswimmer is on-board energy harnessing for locomotion of nanoswimmer in complex surrounding media. In this paper, a design of piezoelectric based energy harnessing systems is proposed and simulated using COMSOL. The design is inspired by amplified stressing on trunk of a tree due to movement of its branched out structure. Amplified stressing is harmful to tree but the concept on contrary is useful in current context and envisages amplified generation of electricity to actuate nanoswimmer. It has been observed through simulation results that amplification of stresses to the tune of 68.95% is achievable by simple primary branching. Corresponding increase in generated electric potential is around 60% which is quite significant and promising towards attempts to realize a nanoswimmer. © 2018 Author(s).},

abstract={Nanocomposite are the most promising advance multi-phase material, having nano particles in its composition within its structure (size being less than 100 nm) and contain at least one phase with constituents in the Nano-meter size range. The properties of nanocomposites are controlled by the type/size of the reinforcement/nature of bonding and type of processing method. Among the various processes of manufacturing prevalent for discontinuous nano hybrid metal matrix composites, particularly stir casting is accepted as a favorable method, which is also commercially viable. Stir casting is advantageous for mass production of composites for being simple and flexible in nature along with cost effectiveness. As it is low-cost comparably and also offers wide selection of materials. Further, it produces better bonding of reinforcements with the matrix, due to the uniform stirring action. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={This paper describes the complete manufacturing process for production of the aluminium foam with its achieved important physical properties and its uses in various industries. The production process of aluminum metallic foam includes high purity molten aluminium in which a small amount of calcium carbonate powder is continuously faded and stirred thoroughly. The decomposition of calcium carbonate release gases, which are entrapped in high viscous mixture of the molten aluminium and calcium residues and create low density porous aluminium foam as shown in figure no. 7 and figure no. 8. The aluminum foam is collected and cooled in the mold. Afterward foam is removed from the mold and cut to the desired sizes. The foam with low density 848 kg/m3 is obtained and density of which is 0.342 times of pure aluminum. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The pigment network is considered as one of the most histopathologically relevant indicator of melanoma. The objective of this empirical study is to design a novel automatic system for detection of pigment network and provide a differentiation between typical and atypical network patterns. The algorithm design consists a set of sequential stages. Pigment network masks are detected using a bank of 2D Gabor filters, and a set of pigment network features are extracted to determine the role of pigment network in the diagnosis of the lesion. In the second stage, a machine learning process is carried out using the rules generated from the pigment network masks to identify the typical and atypical pigment network patterns. The proposed methodology was tested on the PH2 dataset of 200 images, obtaining an average sensitivity of 96%, specificity of 100% and accuracy of 96.7% for lesion diagnosis, and an average sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 84.6%, 88.7% and 86.7% respectively, for pigment network classification. The proposed system stands out amongst the few state of art literatures reported in the context of dermoscopic image analysis in terms of performance and methodologies adopted, thus proving the reliability of the proposed study. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={A numerical simulation is presented to study the heat and flow characteristics of blood flow altered by electroosmosis through the tapered micro-vessels. Blood is assumed as non-Newtonian (micropolar) nanofluids. The flow regime is considered as asymmetric diverging (tapered) microchannel for more realistic micro-vessels which is produced by choosing the peristaltic wave train on the walls to have different amplitudes and phase. The Rosseland approximation is employed to model the radiation heat transfer and temperatures of the walls are presumed constants. The mathematical formulation of the present problem is simplified under the long-wavelength, low-Reynolds number and Debye-Hückel linearization approximations. The influence of various dominant physical parameters are discussed for axial velocity, microrotation distribution, thermal temperature distribution and nanoparticle volume fraction field. However, our foremost emphasis is to determine the effects of thermal radiation and coupling number on the axial velocity and microrotation distribution beneath electroosmotic environment. This analysis places a significant observation on the thermal radiation and coupling number which plays an influential role in hearten fluid velocity. This study is encouraged by exploring the nanofluid-dynamics in peristaltic transport as symbolized by heat transport in biological flows and also in novel pharmacodynamics pumps and gastro-intestinal motility enhancement. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={In this paper, we present an analytical study of pressure-driven flow of micropolar non-Newtonian physiological fluids through a channel comprising two parallel oscillating walls. The cilia are arranged at equal intervals and protrude normally from both walls of the infinitely long channel. A metachronal wave is generated due to natural beating of cilia and the direction of wave propagation is parallel to the direction of fluid flow. Appropriate expressions are presented for deformation via longitudinal and transverse velocity components induced by the ciliary beating phenomenon with cilia assumed to follow elliptic trajectories. The conservation equations for mass, longitudinal and transverse (linear) momentum and angular momentum are reduced in accordance with the long wavelength and creeping Stokesian flow approximations and then normalized with appropriate transformations. The resulting non-linear moving boundary value problem is solved analytically for constant micro-inertia density, subject to physically realistic boundary conditions. Closed-form expressions are derived for axial velocity, angular velocity, volumetric flow rate and pressure rise. The transport phenomena are shown to be dictated by several non-Newtonian parameters, including micropolar material parameter and Eringen coupling parameter, and also several geometric parameters, viz eccentricity parameter, wave number and cilia length. The influence of these parameters on streamline profiles (with a view to addressing trapping features via bolus formation and evolution), pressure gradient and other characteristics are evaluated graphically. Both axial and angular velocities are observed to be substantially modified with both micropolar rheological parameters and furthermore are significantly altered with increasing volumetric flow rate. Free pumping is also examined. An inverse relationship between pressure rise and flow rate is computed which is similar to that observed in Newtonian fluids. The study is relevant to hemodynamics in narrow capillaries and also bio-inspired micro-fluidic devices. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

The magnetic measurements carried out on as prepared sample show signature square hysteresis loop of Fe, which transforms into non-magnetic one in 500 °C annealed sample due to the formation of FeSi 2 interface alloy at the expense of Fe atoms from the layer and Si atoms from the substrate. No intermixing between Fe and Au is seen. Corresponding X-ray reflectivity (XRR) measurements performed on as deposited sample shows clear Kiessig oscillations and can be fitted without considering intermixed layer between Fe and Si, while annealed sample shows interface mixing leading to an increase in thickness and density. The observed results are explained in terms of annealing induced changes at the Fe/Si interface which result in the formation of ß-FeSi 2 phase. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Standard IP is not suitable for internet access in mobile devices because such devices are portable and IP address keeps on getting change in wireless networks. Mobile IP is introduced to provide internet in mobile devices (i.e host mobility). There can be situation, where group of nodes (Mobile Nodes) moves from one network to another network range while accessing internet as network mobility (i.e Network Mobility (NEMO)). In NEMO, there will be gateway called Mobile Router (MR) and provides internet to all MNs and takes care about handoff for all mobile nodes. Whenever NEMO moves from home network to foreign network, it gets new address from visiting network and it has to update Home Agent (HA) regarding its address change. MR intimate about its address changes to HA through Binding Update (BU) and HA sends Binding Acknowledgement (BA) to MR as response. Various security threats arise during messages exchange and during registration between MN, MN, HA and between MN, CN (route optimization path). In this paper, we proposed security method for providing secure Route Optimization (RO) and communication between MN, MR and HA using ECC with stream cipher cryptography.

abstract={An analytical study for electroosmotic flow of Bingham plastic ionic liquids driven by peristaltic pumping through a microchannel is investigated. The Poisson-Boltzmann equation for electric potential distribution is implemented to accommodate the electrical double layer in the microchannel. Boundary layer flow model is simplified under the low Reynolds number and long wavelength approximations. The solution of the electrical potential is based on the Debye- Hückel approximation for a symmetric (Z: Z) electrolyte solution. Closed form solutions for axial velocity, pressure gradient, pressure rise along one wavelength and stream function are derived. To examine the influence of physical parameters like Bingham plug flow width, electroosmotic parameter and Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity on pumping characteristics, computational results are illustrated. With vanishing yield stress, the Newtonian case is retrieved. An increase in plug flow width is observed to decrease volumetric flow rate and has a varied influence on the pressure rise depending on whether the flow is in the free pumping or pumping region. The findings of this study may useful in designing the microfluidics peristaltic pumps which often required to minimize the circulating volume of fluid and also helping to integrate the micropumping structure into the microfluidics circuit. © 2018 Author(s).},

abstract={Treatment or prevention of osteoporotic bone loss is a challenge for clinicians. Recent research efforts have shown that dynamic and cyclic loading may effectively prevent or reverse bone resorption as loading enhances osteogenesis. Loading-induced canalicular fluid flow in bone is considered as a potential stimulus of new bone formation. It is believed that poroelastic material properties such as porosity and permeability typically decide fluid flow in canalicular spaces of bone. Accordingly, the authors hypothesized that changes in poroelastic material properties with age may affect the fluid flow, which in turn affects the new bone response against any external mechanical stimulation. This work attempts to relate the age-related changes in poroelastic material properties to fluid-flow distribution in lacuna-canalicular spaces of bone. The outcomes may be useful in the development of effective strategies to enhance the canalicular fluid flow, so that optimal exercises or sports activities can be designed to prevent or reverse the age-related bone loss. © 2018 Author(s).},

abstract={The present study was undertaken to determine the maximum ground level concentrations (GLC's) for various air pollutants through air dispersion modelling technique. This information of maximum GLC's would then be utilized to assess the relative contributions of emissions due to the operation of the cement production unit. The information would also support in the assessment of the viability of the existing ambient air monitoring network in and around the cement plant. The cement company produces Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) and Pozzolona Portland Cement (PPC) at their unit in Rajasthan, India. The plant is ISO-9001, ISO-14001, and OHSAS-18001 certified and maintains very high level standards in Quality, Environment and Safety fields. It was found that in the study area, the maximum predicted average contribution to ambient PM10, PM2.5, SO2 and NOx due to the operation of cement plant, were 13.6%, 8.2%, 10%, and 17% respectively, as compared to the current National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS, 2009) value. The existing ambient air quality monitoring network was also found to be satisfactory with regards to the representativeness of the data being collected. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Present work mainly aims to explore possible utilization of photosensitive chalcopyrite CdAl2Se4 as potential material in optoelectronic applications. In view to ascertain that, we have performed first principle investigations within frame work of density functional theory (DFT) using full potential linearized augmented plane wave method (FP-LAPW). For better accuracy, volume optimization of lattice parameters and computations of relevant properties are executed using one of the most accurate modified Becke-Johnson (mBJ) potential. Electronic properties revealed are energy bands, total and partial density of states (DOS) which proves direct band gap (2.92 eV) nature for the present compound and supports its deployment in opto-electronic applications. In addition, in order to judge optical response, investigations such as dielectric tensor, reflectivity, refraction and absorption spectra are reported here as a function of frequency. Results observed showing high intensity of absorption spectra in visible energy range i.e. 3-5 eV validate the application of CdAl2Se4 in opto-electronic devices. Calculated results are observed to have reasonable agreement with available experimental calculations. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={With several waste additives been used for increasing the flexural strength of concrete, this research aims at using human hair as an economic and environmental friendly waste material adding much to the sustainable development. Flexural strength of concrete is one of its key mechanical property. By virtue of its flexural strength, concrete beams and slabs are able to transfer the loads to the supports. The present concrete matrix gives only 10 to 12 percent of flexural strength as compared to its compressive strength. Human hair lasts for decades before finally decomposing and entering to Carbon and Nitrogen cycle. The waste human hair dumped in the streams chokes the streams and increases the environmental burden. In this experimental work, feasibility for enhancing the flexural strength of concrete with two-dimensional variation in human hair i.e., the length of hair fiber and its proportion in the concrete matrix, has been investigated. The concrete specimens tested at the age of 7 and 28 days, reveled an increase in the flexural strength as compared to the control mix. The results indicated the possibility of using human hairs as fibers in the concrete mix for sustainable construction practices. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={In vivo studies suggest that cyclic and low-magnitude loading can be useful over pharmaceutical drugs in normalizing bone loss as it encourages osteogenesis (i.e. new bone formation) at the sites of elevated strain magnitude. In silico models assumed normal strain or strain energy density (SED) as the stimulus to predict loading-induced osteogenesis, however, these models may have limited success in fitting the in vivo new bone formation at several instances. For example, rest-inserted cyclic loading amplifies the new bone formation as compared to continuous-cyclic loading even though similar strain magnitude were induced in both the cases. It is also believed that loading-induced interstitial fluid flow can also be a potential stimulus of osteogenesis. The present study hypothesizes that fluid motion as osteogenic stimulus may explain the afore-mentioned anomalies. Accordingly, this work studies osteogenesis as functions of SED and canalicular fluid motion using an in silico model. Therefore, the new bone formation is considered roughly proportional to stimuli above their osteogenic thresholds. This model attempts to simulate in vivo new bone formation noticed in rest-inserted cantilever loading studies. The model's prediction of site-specific new bone formation improves when fluid flow is considered as the stimulus. It is also noticed that fluid motion as the stimulus closely fits the new bone formation for another in vivo study where the effects of aging on osteogenesis were examined. These attempts to establish fluid flow as a potential osteogenic stimulus can be useful in the prediction of site-specific new bone formation. The findings will ultimately be useful in designing biomechanical interventions such as prophylactic exercises to cure bone loss. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The rapid increase in population of India forced people to migrate from rural areas and small towns to metropolitan cities for better employment, education, and, good lifestyle. Major cities of India were industrialized and required more work force in metropolitan cities, leading to uncoordinated and unplanned growth, often termed as urban sprawl. Urban sprawl destroyed the natural resources such as open green space, agricultural land, open water bodies and ground water. In this paper, an attempt has been made to monitor urban sprawl using Shannon's Entropy model, Remote Sensing, and GIS for city Jaipur, India. The changed entropy value during the years 1972-2013 proves more dispersed growth in the city. The built-up area of Jaipur has increased from 40 km2 in 1972 to 400 km2 in 2013. Land use percentage of urban settlement is doubled as compared to the urban population of Jaipur during 1972-2013. This study shows remarkable urban sprawl in fringe areas of Jaipur city in the last 41 years. © 2018 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Misalignments in gears cause vibrations and contact nonlinearities, which in turn cause load distribution shift on the gear tooth. The load distribution shift of the gear pair results in increased contact and bending stresses with the maximum stresses leaning towards the edge of the face width. These stress changes cause failures and gear performance variations, such as pitting, scuffing, crack initiation and eventually tooth breakage. In this paper, the contact and bending stresses of a misaligned spur gear pair were evaluated with and without friction by employing corresponding analytical methods and finite element method (FEM). Friction coefficient values of 0.1 to 0.3 were used to evaluate the effects of friction on contact and bending stress distribution of a spur gear pair with axial and angular misalignments. The stress concentration was found to be higher at the contact point and at the tooth root of the gear with the augmentation of the misalignment distance and angle. The maximum contact and bending stresses increased by 67.5% and 18.9%, respectively, when axial misalignments were subjected. Similarly, the maximum contact and bending stresses increased by 27.0% and 62.4%, respectively, for angular misalignments. Furthermore, the contact and bending stresses increased proportionally with the increasing coefficient of friction. Finally, the relationships between the normalized stress and misalignments (both axial and angular) were established. © Universiti Malaysia Pahang, Malaysia.},

abstract={Cyclic and low-magnitude loading is considered effective in arresting the bone loss as it promotes osteogenesis (i.e. new bone formation) at the sites of elevated normal strain magnitude. In silico models assumed normal strain as the stimulus to predict the sites of new bone formation. These models, however, may fail to fit the amount of newly formed bone. Loading parameters such as strain, frequency, and loading cycle decide the amount of new bone formation. The models did not incorporate this information. In fact, there is no unifying relationship to quantify the amount of new bone formation as a function of loading parameters. Therefore, the present work aims to establish an empirical relationship between loading parameters and a new bone formation parameter i.e. mineral apposition rate (MAR). A neural network model is used to serve the purpose. Loading parameters are supplied as input, whereas, MAR served as output. The model is trained and tested with experimental data. The model establishes an empirical relationship to estimate MAR as a function of loading parameters. The model's predictions of MAR align with in vivo experimental results. The model's response is analyzed which indicates that the bone adaptation characteristics are successfully captured in the relationship. The relationship established may be incorporated further to improve qualitative and quantitative prediction capabilities of computer models. These findings can be extended in future to design and develop effective biomechanical strategies such as prophylactic exercise to cure bone loss. © 2018},

abstract={A theoretical study is presented of peristaltic hydrodynamics of an aqueous electrolytic non-Newtonian Jeffrey bio-rheological fluid through an asymmetric microchannel under an applied axial electric field. An analytical approach is adopted to obtain the closed form solution for velocity, volumetric flow, pressure difference and stream function. The analysis is also restricted under the low Reynolds number assumption (Stokes flow) and lubrication theory approximations (large wavelength). Small ionic Peclét number and Debye–Hückel linearization (i.e. wall zeta potential ≤ 25 mV) are also considered to simplify the Nernst–Planck and Poisson–Boltzmann equations. Streamline plots are also presented for the different electro-osmotic parameter, varying magnitudes of the electric field (both aiding and opposing cases) and for different values of the ratio of relaxation to retardation time parameter. Comparisons are also included between the Newtonian and general non-Newtonian Jeffrey fluid cases. The results presented here may be of fundamental interest towards designing lab-on-a-chip devices for flow mixing, cell manipulation, micro-scale pumps etc. Trapping is shown to be more sensitive to an electric field (aiding, opposing and neutral) rather than the electro-osmotic parameter and viscoelastic relaxation to retardation ratio parameter. The results may also help towards the design of organ-on-a-chip like devices for better drug design. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.},

It was observed that PMMA host matrix is more affected by doping in comparison with PVA matrix, which shows bond modifications and crystallization with small doping. The band-edges are observed to shift, thereby lowering the band-gaps of the base polymers upon doping. While the changes are seen only below the absorption edge in PVA, PMMA exhibits alterations in both the band edge and overall transmission in the range of 300–900 nm.

abstract={In the present work thermal performance of Direct Absorption Solar Collector (DASC) with TiO 2 -water (nanofluid) as working fluid was investigated experimentally. DASC utilizes the principle of volumetric absorption i.e. solar energy absorbed by a thin film of working fluid flowing over the collector plate. The experimental study was carried out in four phases; in first phase flow rate was kept 2 lpm and volume fraction of nanofluid was changed from 0.001% to 0.007%, in second and third phase same procedure was followed for 2.5 lpm and 1.5 lpm flow rates respectively. In fourth phase the experiment was carried out with water for 1.5 lpm, 2 lpm and 2.5 lpm and the performance of collector was analyzed. Results obtained suggest that for water as a working fluid, thermal performance of the DASC at 2 lpm was better. Secondly, when nanofluid was used as a working fluid, thermal performance of the collector was found better for 0.005% volume concentration. © 2018 IEEE.},

The Bloch-Siegert shift (BSS) is a shift in Rabi oscillation resonance condition, when the driving field is sufficiently strong. There are new type of oscillations exhibit in Weyl semimetal at far from resonance, known as anomalous Rabi oscillation. In this work, we study the phenomenon of the Bloch-Siegert shift in Weyl semimetal at far from resonance called anomalous Bloch-Siegert shift (ABSS) by purely quantum mechanical treatment and describe it's anisotropic nature. A fully numerical solution of the Floquet-Bloch equations unequivocally establishes the presence of not only anomalous Rabi oscillations in these systems but also their massless character. © 2018 Author(s).},

abstract={Progressive Visual Cryptography (PVC) is quite suitable for sharing sensitive digital data. Previous research on PVC, such as Fang et al. (2006) and W.P.Fang et al.(2008) were all carrying pixel-expansion problem and also gives a poor visual quality on the recovered stacked image. Recently, Hou & Quan (2011) have developed a progressive scheme for secret sharing. It is observed that shares generated by the scheme are free from pixel expansion problem, but shares are not fully secure. In this paper, a new progressive sharing algorithm based on logistic chaotic map has been proposed to overcome the said limitation of Hou (2011) scheme. The irregular outputs of the logistic map are used to encode a secret digital information carrying image. The performance of the algorithm in the scheme of Hou (2011) is critically analyzed and compared with new suggested scheme. Empirical results are presented to showcase the performance of the authors' proposed scheme in terms of its effectiveness (imperceptibility and security) and feasibility. © 2018 by IGI Global.

abstract={Transition metal substituted Zinc oxide (ZnO) has drawn a great deal of attention due to its excellent properties. Zn0.9Mn0.05Fe0.05O sample synthesized was by Sol-gel wet chemical precipitation route at temperature 350°C. The crystallinity and the structure of Zn0.9Mn0.05Fe0.05O was determined by X-ray diffraction by Cu-Kα radiations operated at 40kV and 35mA in the range of 20° to 80°. The pattern gets indexed in wurtzite (hexagonal) structure with lattice constants a=b=3.2525Å and c=5.2071Å and approves the single phase material with no impurity. The values of particle size assessed by Debye Scherer's (DS) formula lie in the range of 13nm to 33nm indicating the nano-crystalline nature of the sample. The morphological analysis of the sample was performed by Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements. The observed size of Zn0.9Mn0.05Fe0.05O nanoparticles by TEM micrograph exhibits the similar trend with the size calculated by Debye-Scherer formula. TEM image show the irregular shape of the nanoparticles and particle size lies in the range of 10-35nm.

abstract={In this article, the design and performance of circular radiating patch element with two U-shaped slots and defected ground plane, comprising of a triangular notch monopole structure with rhomboid shape resonator, is reported. The proposed multiband antenna has a compact structure design for GSM 1800 MHz, WLAN, WiMAX and UWB communication systems. The antenna is designed on FR4 glass epoxy substrate of size 39 mm × 34 mm × 1.59 mm by using computer simulation tool CST Microwave Studio 2014. For confirmation of simulation results, prototypes are fabricated and their performance is tested in free space. Measured results demonstrate that fabricated antenna provides triple bands with impedance bandwidth of 157 MHz (1.733 GHz to 1.89 GHz), 3.2 GHz (2.29 GHz to 5.49 GHz) & 10.45 GHz (6.83 GHz to 17.28 GHz), almost flat high gain between 4 to 6 dBi and good radiation patterns in the desired frequency range. The maximum measured gain of proposed structure is close to 6.59 dBi at 4.40 GHz. The circular polarization is also realized in the frequency range 4.12 GHz to 5.20 GHz with axial impedance bandwidth 1.08 GHz. The specific absorption rate SAR values of proposed design are also evaluated at various frequency spots which are well within the SAR values specified by the FCC. Proposed design may be proved a useful structure for advance radio communications systems as well as for the present requirements in defence applications. © School of Engineering, Taylor’s University.},

abstract={Multi-walled Carbon nanotubes-copper (MWCNT/Cu) composite powders with variable MWCNT content were synthesized by modified electro-co-deposition method. The electro-co-deposited MWCNT/Cu powders were consolidated by conventional compaction and sintering process. The consolidated products were then hot rolled and cold drawn to fine wires. The MWCNT/Cu composite wire samples were characterized for electrical and mechanical properties. We have been able to achieve an increase of around 8% in electrical conductivity of the form wires repeatedly. It has been observed that there was gradual improvement in the properties with reinforcement of MWCNT in the copper matrix. The betterment of electrical property has been achieved with simultaneous improvement in mechanical properties of the wire. The yield strength of MWCNT/Cu composite wire was found to be four times and the tensile strength two times greater than that of pure copper. The improved properties are attributed to the proper distribution of MWCNTs in the copper matrix and excellent interfacial bonding between MWCNT and composite copper fabricated by the modified method. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Bio composite materials were fabricated using mixing biodegradable polymer polycaptalactone (PCL) and Organo Modified Montmorillonite Clay (OMMT) through solution casting. Various samples of bio composite films were prepared by varying the OMMT wt% composition by 0.1%, 0.5%, 1% and 1.5%. Thereafter, the density and water absorption of the composites were investigated with respect to immersion time in water. The moisture absorption results show that with an increase in weight percentage (from 0.1 to wt 1.5%) of OMMT within the bio polymer films, the absorption value of bio-nanocomposite films reduced rapidly from 34.4% to 22.3%. The density of hybrid composites also increased with increase in weight percentage of OMMT. The swelling characteristic of PCL increased with increasing % of OMMT clay. These results indicate that the optimized composition of constituents in composite membrane could effectively reduce the anhydrous conditions of bio-composite film. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The energy harnessing is a process of obtaining energy from the surrounding environment and converting into electrical energy. In the last two decades, there has been a plenteous study in energy harnessing. Now a day, energy harnessing using piezoelectric materials has drawn attention of researchers due to low cost, flexibility and light weight. The benefits of piezoelectric material can be utilized by designing a self-powered device for artificial nanoswimmer. Some of the ceramics which displays the piezoelectric effect are lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT), lead-titanate (PbTiO2), lead-zirconate (PbZrO3) and Barium Titanate (BaTiO3). PZT is most extensively used piezoelectric material in the field of energy harnessing but it is brittle in nature. Lead based piezoelectric materials are toxic in nature and may not suitable for in-vivo biomedical applications. To eradicate this problem, researchers are interested in synthesizing lead free piezoelectric material such as Aluminium Nitride (AIN), Barium Titanate (BaTiO3) and Polyvinylidenefluoride (PVDF). The biocompatibility of PVDF makes it appropriate to be used for energy harnessing in human body for applications like on board powering of nanoswimmer for various disease detection and drug delivery. In this paper, a cantilever beam is being simulated in COMSOL to study electric potential generated on the surface of beam made of different piezoelectric materials such as AIN, PVDF and PZT due to fluidic pressure, which will be utilized as energy for actuation of artificial nanoswimmer. Piezo-based cantilever beams have been compared and maximum electric potential is being observed in PVDF based beam. PVDF seems most promising piezoelectric material for in-vivo biomedical application and it is readily available. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Two bioreactors (column and U-tube) were compared for continuous dye decolourization efficiency using a laccase-producing white rot fungus, Phlebia radiata. Column bioreactor containing immobilized crude enzyme beads and U-tube continuous bioreactor containing actively growing fungal biomass were established. Synthetic dye (coracryl blue C5G) solution treated with immobilized crude enzyme on alginate beads showed a maximum net decolourization up to 55% (flow rate 1 ml/min). The U-tube bioreactor was more efficient in decolorizing the dye, which showed a net decolourization up to 64% at faster flow rate (2.5 ml/min). The decolorization efficiency in both the systems was positively influenced by the slower flow rate. Thus, the study presents designing and operations of two continuous small-scale bioreactors one with immobilized enzyme while the another one with direct fungal contact. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={An analytical study of microvascular non-Newtonian blood flow is conducted incorporating the electro-osmosis phenomenon. Blood is considered as a Bingham rheological aqueous ionic solution. An externally applied static axial electrical field is imposed on the system. The Poisson-Boltzmann equation for electrical potential distribution is implemented to accommodate the electrical double layer in the microvascular regime. With long wavelength, lubrication and Debye-Hückel approximations, the boundary value problem is rendered non-dimensional. Analytical solutions are derived for the axial velocity, volumetric flow rate, pressure gradient, volumetric flow rate, averaged volumetric flow rate along one time period, pressure rise along one wavelength and stream function. A plug swidth is featured in the solutions. Via symbolic software (Mathematica), graphical plots are generated for the influence of Bingham plug flow width parameter, electrical Debye length and Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity (maximum electro-osmotic velocity) on the key hydrodynamic variables. This study reveals that blood flow rate accelerates with decreasing the plug width (i.e. viscoplastic nature of fluids) and also with increasing the Debye length parameter. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={An analytical analysis is presented in this work to assess the influence of micropolar nature of fluids in fully developed flow induced by electrokinetically driven peristaltic pumping through a parallel plate microchannel. The walls of the channel are assumed as sinusoidal wavy to analyze the peristaltic flow nature. We consider that the wavelength of the wall motion is much larger as compared to the channel width to validate the lubrication theory. To simplify the Poisson Boltzmann equation, we also use the Debye-Hückel linearization. We consider governing equation for micropolar fluid in absence of body force and couple effects however external electric field is employed. The solutions for axial velocity, spin velocity, flow rate, pressure rise, and stream functions subjected to given physical boundary conditions are computed. The effects of pertinent parameters like Debye length and Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity which characterize the EDL phenomenon and external electric field, coupling number and micropolar parameter which characterize the micropolar fluid behavior, on peristaltic pumping are discussed through the illustrations. The results show that peristaltic pumping may alter by applying external electric fields. This model can be used to design and engineer the peristalsis-lab-on-chip and micro peristaltic syringe pumps for biomedical applications. © 2018, Korean Society of Rheology (KSR) and the Australian Society of Rheology (ASR) and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Graphene, topological insulators (TI) and the Weyl semimetal are shown to be well-characterized using the phenomenon of anomalous Rabi oscillation (ARO). These oscillations occur far from conventional resonance and Floquet theory shows them to be unique to these systems. Of particular interest is the bulk topological insulator (TI) where the wave-vector dependent frequency of the ARO is seen to be gapped in topologically trivial situations and gapless when there is a non-vanishing Chern number. It is shown that the Chern number may be directly inferred by performing a pump-probe experiment in the bulk without referring to surface states. A simpler alternative to the Lindblad method is invoked in order to incorporate dephasing effects that despite leading to a non-unitary time evolution of the wave-function, is nevertheless, probability conserving. The differential transmission coefficient versus the pump pulse duration (when all else is held fixed) has the form of a sinusoidal function with an amplitude that decays as a power law in the pump duration (alternatively, the “area” of the pump pulse). The exponent of this power law decay is indicative of the Chern number of the bulk in case of TI and more generally indicative of the particular member of the family of materials that may be collectively referred to as – Dirac-Weyl materials. © 2018, EDP Sciences, SIF, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={This paper aims to analyze the electroosmotic flow of non-Newtonian ionic nanoliquids in presence of peristaltic propulsion. A geometric model is employed for a microfluidic tapered channel flow regime. Williamson's fluid model is utilized to characterize non-Newtonian nature of the base fluid. The normalized governing equations are reduced with lubrication approximations (long wavelength and low Reynolds number assumptions). Poisson-Boltzmann equation is also simplified by using Debye-Hückel linearization. No slip conditions are imposed at the channel walls. The analytical solutions are obtained for temperature field and nanoparticle volume fraction. However, a perturbation method is used to find out an approximate solution for axial velocity, pressure rise and volumetric flow rate. The perturbation solutions are further graphically illustrated with MATLAB software. The perturbation solution is also validated with numerical results simulated by MATLAB coding through BVP command. The effects of thermal radiation and non-Newtonian parameters on flow characteristics, pumping characteristics, wall shear stress and trapping phenomenon are discussed. A comparative study is also made to study the electroosmotic flow through uniform and nonuniform asymmetric microfluidic channel. This model can help to study the intrauterine fluid dynamics governed by electroosmosis mechanism. It can also be applicable in drug delivery, in vivo diagnostics, food diagnostics, packaging (smart sensors), DNA chips, protein chips and cell chips. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

The investigations performed such as energy band structure, Density of States (DOS), optical parameters like complex dielectric function and absorption co-efficient are discussed over here to understand the overall response of the chosen system. © 2018 Author(s).},

abstract={The spin transport properties of pristine graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) have been most widely studied using theoretical and experimental tools. The possibilities of oxidation of fabricated graphene based nano electronic devices may change the device characteristics, which motivates to further explore the properties of graphene oxide nanoribbons (GONRs). Therefore, we present a systematic computational study on the spin polarized transport in surface oxidized GNR in antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin configuration using density functional theory combined with non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) method. It is found that the conductance in oxidized GNRs is significantly suppressed in the valance band and the conduction band. A further reduction in the conductance profile is seen in presence of two oxygen atoms on the ribbon plane. This change in the conductance may be attributed to change in the surface topology of the ribbon basal plane due to presence of the oxygen adatoms, where the charge transfer take place between the ribbon basal plane and the oxygen atoms. © 2018 Author(s).},

abstract={The Bloch-Siegert shift is a phenomenon in quantum optics, typically seen in two-level systems, when the driving field is sufficiently strong. The inclusion of frequency doubling effect (counter rotating term) in the conventional rotating wave approximation (RWA) changes the resonance condition thereby producing a rather small shift in the resonance condition, which is known as the Bloch-Siegert shift (BSS). Rabi oscillations in Dirac-Weyl fermionic systems exhibit anomalous behavior far from resonance, called anomalous Rabi oscillations. Therefore, in the present work, we study the phenomenon of the Bloch-Siegert shift in Weyl semimetal and topological insulator (TI) far from resonance, called anomalous Bloch-Siegert shift (ABSS). It is seen that the change in the resonance condition of anomalous Rabi oscillations is drastic in Weyl semimetal and TI. The ABSS in Weyl semimetals is highly anisotropic, whereas it is isotropic in TI. In case of TI, it is the Chern number which plays a crucial role to produce substantial change in the ABSS. © 2018 Author(s).},

abstract={This paper proposes a resilient, bandwidth scalable and energy efficient WDM–TDM passive optical network (PON) architecture that provides network access services to the end user at very high data rates and reduces the power consumption of access network significantly in the presence of low traffic/underutilized network. The proposed power saving technique includes the efficient use of proper line cards (LC) and adaptive link rate (ALR) mechanism at optical line terminal located at the central office. In the presence of low traffic, ALR switches link rate from 10 to 1 Gbps depending on the particular threshold value of traffic load. In the presence of narrowband traffic, a significant amount of energy is saved. Proposed architecture also saves capital expenditure (CAPEX) at remote node and reduces significant CAPEX for larger networks. This architecture also provides network resiliency against LC/TRx or module failure and bandwidth scalability to support future generation PON architectures without any service interruption. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={The transportation of biological and industrial nanofluids by natural propulsion like cilia movement and self-generated contraction-relaxation of flexible walls has significant applications in numerous emerging technologies. Inspired by multi-disciplinary progress and innovation in this direction, a thermo-fluid mechanical model is proposed to study the entropy generation and convective heat transfer of nanofluids fabricated by the dispersion of single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) nanoparticles in water as the base fluid. The regime studied comprises heat transfer and steady, viscous, incompressible flow, induced by metachronal wave propulsion due to beating cilia, through a cylindrical tube containing a sparse (i.e., high permeability) homogenous porous medium. The flow is of the creeping type and is restricted under the low Reynolds number and long wavelength approximations. Slip effects at the wall are incorporated and the generalized Darcy drag-force model is utilized to mimic porous media effects. Cilia boundary conditions for velocity components are employed to determine analytical solutions to the resulting non-dimensionalized boundary value problem. The influence of pertinent physical parameters on temperature, axial velocity, pressure rise and pressure gradient, entropy generation function, Bejan number and stream-line distributions are computed numerically. A comparative study between SWCNT-nanofluids and pure water is also computed. The computations demonstrate that axial flow is accelerated with increasing slip parameter and Darcy number and is greater for SWCNT-nanofluids than for pure water. Furthermore the size of the bolus for SWCNT-nanofluids is larger than that of the pure water. The study is applicable in designing and fabricating nanoscale and microfluidics devices, artificial cilia and biomimetic micro-pumps. © 2018, China Ship Scientific Research Center.},

Computation of solutions is presented for velocity profile, temperature profile and concentration profile. The effects of all the physical parameters such as particle volume fraction, Hartmann number, Hall Effect, Prandtl number, Eckert number, Schmidt number and Soret number are discussed mathematically and graphically. It is noted that the influence of magnetic field and particle volume fraction opposes the flow.

The proposed OPP problem determines coordinated observability considering multiple contingency cases: single line outage, double line outage resulting in bus isolation, single PMU loss resulting in communication failure. Integer Linear Programming (ILP) is used to determine optimal number and locations for OPP problem. Moreover, Optimal PMU placement problem with conventional measurements is modified for incorporation of bus isolation caused due to contingency. The effectiveness of proposed methodology has been tested on IEEE 14-bus system and New England 39-bus power system.

abstract={The essential structure of Steganography is comprised of three parts: Cover image, message, and the key. The transporter can be a computerized Image; the question will convey the shrouded message. A key is utilized to interpret/disentangle/find the concealed message. Steganography, which means shrouded composing, is the procedure of hiding mystery data into another cover-media, for example, sound, video, Image and content, in such a way, to the point that the very presence of the data is disguised. In this paper, steganographic methods for computerized Images, which are utilized as a cover media, are examined and dissected. An amended steganographic strategy with information concealing strategies are proposed so the concealing limit can be amplified without bringing about noticeable corruption in the Image quality and the installed mystery information can be recuperated accurately without referencing the first cover-Image. © 2017 IEEE.},

Arrival of the customers follows Poisson distribution dependent upon the server's state. The service of the customer starts only when at least N customers are there in the system and turns off when system becomes empty. Queue size distribution is obtained using Generating function method. We derive cost function in term of cost elements related to different situations and determine the optimal operating policy.

abstract={While extracting land cover from remote sensing images, each pixel in the image is allocated to one of the possible class. In reality different land covers within a pixel can be found due to continuum of variation in landscape and intrinsic mixed nature of most classes. Mixed pixels may not be appropriately processed by traditional image classifiers, which assume that pixels are pure. The existence of mixed pixels led to the development of several approaches for soft (often termed fuzzy in the remote sensing literature) classification in which each pixel is allocated to all classes in varying proportions. However, while the proportions of each land cover within each pixel may be predicted, the spatial location of each land cover within each pixel is not. Thus, it is important to develop and implement a classifier that can work as soft classifiers for landslide identification. This work is an attempt to document and identify landslide areas by five spectral indices using temporal multi-spectral images from IRS-P6 LISS-IV images. To improve the spectral properties of spectral indices for specific class identification (in this case landslide) a Class Based Sensor Independent (CBSI) technique proposed. The result indicates that CBSI based Transformed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (TNDVI) temporal indices data gives better results for landslide identification with minimum entropy and membership range. © Authors 2018.

abstract={In the recent years, the improvement in Internet coverage, speed and a decrease in service cost have made it accessible for the common masses. The Internet which was once used only for reading text or viewing basic images is now witnessing a marked surge in the audio-visual content as well as traffic. Cloud based Content Delivery Network accelerate content delivery for websites and applications as they are served from cloud storage. Cloud CDN (CCDN) lowers network latency, offloads origin, and reduces service costs. In this paper, we propose a 2-tier structure for video streaming, one which uses CCDN and priority based round robin scheduling algorithm and the 2nd which creates a dedicated Peer to Peer network for each video and uses chunk based distribution with videos hashed using DHT. The scheduling algorithm in the 1st tier of our proposed structure efficiently balances load of the central node and the P2P network, along with DHT in the 2nd tier provide for efficient distribution of chunks of videos, reducing the buffer time. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Electro-osmotic peristaltic transport of aqueous nanofluids in a two-dimensional micro-channel is examined analytically. Such flows arise in bio-mimetic pumping systems at the very small scale of interest in physiological treatment e.g. occular drug delivery systems. Complex waveforms are imposed at the walls to mimic sophisticated peristaltic wave propagation scenarios. Nano-particles are assumed to be in local thermal equilibrium. Joule electro-thermal heating is included. The dimensional conservation equations are linearized and transformed from the wave to the fixed (laboratory) frame under lubrication theory approximations. The emerging dimensionless model features a number of important thermo-physical, electrical and nanoscale parameter, namely thermal and solutal (basic density) Grashof numbers, nanoscale Brownian motion parameter, thermophoresis parameter, Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity (maximum electro-osmotic velocity), Debye electrokinetic length and Joule heating to surface heat flux ratio. Closed-form solutions are derived for the nano-particle volume fraction, temperature, axial velocity, averaged volumetric flow rate, pressure difference across one wavelength, skin friction (wall shear stress function), Nusselt number (wall heat transfer rate) and stream function distribution in the wave frame. The influence of selected parameters on these flow variables is studied with the aid of graphs. Bolus formation is also visualized and streamline distributions are observed to be strongly influenced and asymmetric in nature. © 2017 The Society of Powder Technology Japan},

abstract={Metal-halide perovskites are rapidly emerging crystalline materials that are reasonably preferred as leading aspirant for applications in optoelectronic and thermoelectric devices. In this paper, we have thoroughly reviewed and performed calculations to reveal optoelectronic and transport properties for a potential newcomer, Cs 2 PdX 6 (X = Cl, Br) termed as Cesium Palladium Halides (CPH). Outcome of present computations are compared with available results and a reasonable agreement is recorded. Energy band gap computations performed reveal indirect band gap of 2.29 eV for Cs 2 PdCl 6 , which substantially reduces to 1.22 eV when ‘Cl’ is replaced by ‘Br’. Optical absorption spectra investigations performed here, in the energy range from 3 to 5 eV confirms effective utilization of these compounds in solar cells and other optoelectronic applications. In addition, the transport properties computations performed using semi-classical Boltzmann theory, shows constant pattern of thermo power near ambient temperature range (200–500 K), which admits possible utilization of these compounds as low temperature thermoelectric materials. Performed ZT calculations demonstrates reasonably good thermoelectric performance for both materials, as there exist minor variation (0.1) in the values over wide temperature ranges i.e. from 100 to 800 K. Further, detailed analysis of transport properties predicts p-type semiconducting nature of the present series of materials. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Moringa oleifera Lam. (vern. Drumstick) is a mineral rich, medicinally important tree species of family Moringaceae. It has a wide range of culinary applications and has bioremediation, nutritional and medicinal properties. Conventionally, seeds of the tree have been used as natural coagulants and flocculents in waste water treatment. Its leaves and bark act as biosorbent for remediation of heavy metals and dyes. The tree provides remedies for a range of diseases and disorders by dint of its unique combination of numerous phytochemicals. Gum exudates of the tree are of immense medicinal importance due to their applications in biodegradable drug delivery systems and in treatment of asthma, dysentery and intestinal cancer. The multidimensional utilities of M. oleifera may cause overexploitation of this tree, posing danger to the existing natural variability in the near future. Therefore, there is a need for conservation of the species for ethnobotanical, pharmacological, nutraceutical and biodiversity purposes. Development of tissue culture propagation methods will assist in preserving some of the germplasm of the species. In the present review, consolidated analysis of the role of biotechnology in conservation and genetic enhancement of nutritional, medicinal and commercial value of the tree has been placed in perspective, together with an up to date review on phytochemical analysis of the plant, and its utility has been discussed to invite the attention of the scientific community to further consider the study of this miracle tree species and its nutritional and pharmaceutical properties. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH},

abstract={Oxime-modified aluminium(III) isopropoxide, [Al(OiPr){ONC(CH3)2}2] was used as a sol-gel precursor to deposit alumina film on steel substrate by dip coating method. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the above compound indicates its clean one step decomposition to alumina at low temperature, making it a suitable spray pyrolysis deposition (SPD) precursor for deposition of alumina film over steel at 400 °C. The formed alumina films (dip and spray coated) were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopic (EDX) techniques. The XRD patterns of the films suggest deposition of amorphous alumina films while the FTIR and EDX analyses indicate the presence of alumina film on steel substrate. SEM images of coated samples indicate deposition of crack-free alumina films. The thickness of alumina films (dip and spray coated) were found to be in the range of ~ 1.4 ± 0.2 μm as indicated by their cross sectional views. The corrosion protection of the deposited alumina films has been checked by the electrochemical studies; open circuit potential (OCP), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and potentiodynamic polarization. The electrochemical studies suggest corrosion resistive nature of the alumina film in 3.5% (w/v) NaCl solution. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The effects of Soret and Dufour on thermophoertic MHD radiative flow and heat transfer over a non-linear stretching sheet have been investigated. Chemical reaction is also taken into consideration. Suitable similarity transformations are used to solve the governing partial differential equation. The resulting non-dimensional governing equations are solved numerically by the fourth fifth order Runge–Kutta Fehlberg method with shooting technique. It is observed that temperature and concentration profile enhance with increasing Dufour parameter whereas Soret parameter decreases temperature profile. Exactly opposite effects have been noted in concentration profile. Rate of heat transfer increases with Prandtl number Pr and Biot number Bi, however, reduces with magnetic field parameter M and thermophoretic coefficient τ. Sherwood number shows enhancement with thermophoretic coefficient and chemical reaction parameter K R . It is also observed that concentration boundary layer profile is a decreasing function of thermophoretic parameter and chemical reaction parameter, due to consumption of chemical, takes place during a chemical reaction. The results obtained are found excellent in agreement with the existing literature. © 2018, Springer (India) Private Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={A compact dual band-notched Ultra-wideband (UWB) circular monopole antenna that has two parasitic resonators in the ground plane is presented in this paper. The Inverted–U and Iron shaped parasitic resonators are located on the back side of the radiating patch to achieve the band rejection characteristics from 5 to 5.4 GHz for WLAN and 7.8 to 8.4 GHz for ITU band respectively. By cutting a rectangular slot on the ground plane, additional resonance is excited at the higher frequency band, and hence much wider impedance bandwidth can be attained. Applications of the proposed dual band-notched ultra-wideband (UWB) antenna structure with 5.2 GHz and 8.2 GHz center frequencies are demonstrated experimentally. Measured and simulated results of the magnitude of S11, radiation patterns and realized gains show good agreement. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH},

abstract={This study showcases the potential of unnatural amino acids to enable non-natural functions when incorporated in the protein scaffold of heme metalloproteins. For this purpose, a genetically-engineered myoglobin (Mb) mutant was created by incorporating redox-active 3-amino-L-tyrosine (NH2Tyr) into its active site, replacing the distal histidine (H64) with NH2Tyr. In peroxide-shunt assays, this variant exhibits an increased rate of turnover for thioanisole and benzaldehyde oxidation as compared to the wild-type (WT) Mb. Indeed, in the presence of excess hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a 9-fold and 81-fold increase in activity was observed over multiple turnovers for thioanisole sulfoxidation and benzoic acid formation, respectively. The increased oxidation activity in the H64NH2Tyr Mb mutant underlined the role of NH2Tyr in the distal active-site scaffold in peroxide activation. Kinetic, electrochemical, and EPR spectroscopic experiments were performed. On the basis of these studies, it is argued that the single NH2Tyr residue within the Mb variant simultaneously serves the role of the conserved His/Arg-pair within the distal pocket of horseradish peroxidase. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Automatic person identification using face information is very challenging task in the field of computer vision. A simple and efficient face recognition approach based on Gabor phase pattern and Self Organizing Maps is presented here. Histogram of Gabor Phase Pattern is used in proposed approach for feature extraction and Self Organizing maps are used as a classifier to identify whether the given grayscale image belongs to a particular class or not. In contrast to other feature extraction techniques, faster results are obtained using Histogram of Gabor Phase Patterns as feature detection occurs automatically without the need of any training procedure. A series of extensive experiments performed on various databases on MATLAB shows that proposed approach achieved a recognition rate of 97.33%, 96.49% and 94.20% for 7 consecutive trials on ORL, YALE and JAFFE databases respectively. It is demonstrated through experimental results that the proposed approach yields significant gain in terms of computational simplicity and effective accuracy. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Three dyes based on a triphenylamine (TPA) moiety using a silicon bridge have been synthesised, namely CL-1D, CL-OMe and CL-SiMe. Structural benefits of long alkyl chains and electron donor group on photo conversion efficiency (PCE) of dye sensitized solar cells is discussed. A previously synthesised dye, denoted CL-1, which contained long alkyl chains and exhibited an efficiency of 6.90%, was compared with CL-SiMe, which contained shorter alkyl chains and showed and efficiency of 3.41%. A large drop in Jsc and Voc was found to be the reason for the appreciable decline in efficiency for CL-SiMe vis-à-vis CL-1. Electron donor group studies were performed using CL-1D and CL-OMe. CL-1D, which contained bulky aniline electron donor groups, showed an efficiency of 4.20%, whilst CL-OMe, featuring smaller methoxy donor groups had an efficiency of 5.50%. Theoretical UV–Vis absorption spectra were obtained for the CL-1D dye by time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT); the experimental and calculated values of the energy for maximum absorbance were in good agreement with experimental data. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Carbon to nitrogen ratio (C/N) is not the lone limiting factors in biological nutrient removal from municipal wastewaters, but readily biodegradable to slowly biodegradable COD ratio (rbCOD/sbCOD) inter alia governs the process of nutrient removal. An intermittent aeration pre-anoxic sequencing batch reactor was operated at C/N ratio of 3, 7.5, and 10 and at rbCOD/sbCOD ratios of 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5 at different sludge internal recirculation ratios. The increasing trend in nitrogen removal was observed with above mentioned operating parameters. At high C/N and rbCOD/sbCOD ratio of 10 and 0.5 the maximum total nitrogen (TN) removal was 90.7% giving 3.8 mg/L TN in the effluent out of 30 mg/L in the influent. At average sewage quality consisting of C/N and rbCOD/sbCOD ratio of 7.5 and 0.25; the TN removal was not more than 83%. The specific nitrate removal rate varied from 0.010 to 0.022 gNO3-/gVSSa.d (0.015 ± 0.0013) at C/N ratio of 3.0, 0.013–0.018 gNO3-/gVSSa.d (0.017 ± 0.0011) at 7.5 and 0.013–0.015 gNO3-/gVSSa.d (0.014 ± 0.001) at 10. The increase in specific nitrate removal rate was coherent to high rbCOD/sbCOD ratio but as the C/N increased to 10 this effect was nullified. The result conformed to defined stoichiometric model based on C/N, rbCOD/sbCOD and sludge internal recirculation ratios. It will help in further effluent polishing with respect to nutrient removal to achieve desired treated wastewater quality. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The authentication models are utilized among the various network based applications, between various homogeneous and heterogeneous network appliances, Internet of things (IoT) applications, Healthcare applications, etc. The authentication models relies upon the encryption models for the protection of data during the propagation of the keys over the communication media. A weak encryption method may lower the security level of authentication model. The complex encryption models are also considered slower, which eventually increase the authentication delay and decreases the overall performance of authentication models. In this paper, a robust, quick and complex encryption model has been proposed model, which have been defined as the parallel partial model (PPM). The PPM algorithm is capable of keeping the higher level security, while decreased the authentication delay. The PPM method collaborates the improved Advanced Encryption Standard (iAES) and modified Elliptic Curve Cryptography (mECC) to fulfill the need to secure and quick encryption algorithm.

abstract={Cryogenically treated electrically conductive tool-electrodes have been used for machining of super alloys. This enhanced and modifies the properties of tool-electrode, which improves machinability of EDMed alloys. Present study determines the effects of cryogenic treatment on performance of Cu-electrode for hole making on Inconel-718 super alloy. Cu-tool electrodes (having helical-threads) have being given rotational motion for effective flushing of debris, reducing formation of recast layer with less tool wear. EDM performance measure viz. tool wear rate has been evaluated against the variation of tool diameter, discharge current, pulse-on time, pulse-off time, tool rotation and depth of hole using Taguchi's method. The results reported that hole depth and discharge current are the two most significant process parameters effecting tool wear rate (TWR). It is also found that tool wear rate obtained lesser for cryogenically treated tool electrode. Copyright © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={The rapid increase in population of India forced people to migrate from rural areas and small towns to metropolitan cities for better employment, education, and, good lifestyle. Major cities of India were industrialized and required more work force in metropolitan cities, leading to uncoordinated and unplanned growth, often termed as urban sprawl. Urban sprawl destroyed the natural resources such as open green space, agricultural land, open water bodies and ground water. In this paper, an attempt has been made to monitor urban sprawl using Shannon’s Entropy model, Remote Sensing, and GIS for city Jaipur, India. The changed entropy value during the years 1972-2013 proves more dispersed growth in the city. The built-up area of Jaipur has increased from 40 km2 in 1972 to 400 km2 in 2013. Land use percentage of urban settlement is doubled as compared to the urban population of Jaipur during 1972-2013. This study shows remarkable urban sprawl in fringe areas of Jaipur city in the last 41 years. © 2019 by IGI Global.},

abstract={Microbial fuel cell is one of the most convenient and cost-effective technology for producing the clean energy. This study explores the exoelectrogenic behavior of Pichia fermentans in a microbial fuel cell. Two different reactor designs (double- and single-chambered) were tested in the presence and in the absence of a mediator (methylene blue). The influence of extracellular polymeric substances in the electricity generation has also been studied. In a double-chambered setup, maximum open circuit voltages were measured as 0.602 and 0.488 V with mediator and without mediator cell, respectively, whereas maximum power densities were measured as 1.23 μWcm −2 and 0.407 μWcm −2 , respectively. In addition, maximum open circuit voltages were observed as 0.40 and 0.397 V in a single-chambered fuel cell with and without mediator, respectively. The maximum power density was recorded 1.64 μWcm −2 in the presence of a mediator, whereas the same was found as 0.643 μWcm −2 in the absence of mediator. Thus, these results indicate that P. fermentans has the ability to produce high power density under microaerophilic conditions with mediator in a single-chambered membrane less setup. © 2018 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan},

abstract={This paper deals with identifying the cancer affected region of the brain. Many tools and techniques such as self-organising map (SOM), Proximal Support Vector Machine (PSVM) classifiers etc. exist to find out the cancer affected region in the brain. But the rapid growth in brain tumour cases in recent past indicates that the existing technologies have failed to identify its root cause as identification is a complex process and recent studies also reveal that different types of brain tumours can be treated either through surgery or in rare cases, with radiation. Image segmentation helps in identifying brain tumours, by calculating the volume and the growth of the tumours using techniques like human edge correction, outer edge colouring and interactive threshold holdings. In order to reduce the human error and to get the accurate results in MRI images there is an urgent need to find out an automatic or semi-automatic method for the classification of brain tumour images. The paper presents a ‘hybrid SP’ classifier and discusses its results in the detection and classification of brain cancer. Copyright © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={Even though finding out distance is the central core of k-Nearest Neighbor classification techniques, similarity measures are often favored against distance in various realistic scenarios and situation. Most of the similarity measures, which are used to classify an instance, are based on geometric model. Their effectiveness decreases with the increases in the number of dimensions. This paper establishes an efficient technique called ARSkNN for finding out class of any given instance using a measure based on an unique similarity, that does no longer compute distance, for k-NN classification. Our empirical results show that ARSkNN classification technique is better than the previous established k-NN classifiers. The performance of algorithm was verified and validated on various datasets from different domains. © 2018 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Sudoku is one of the most popular puzzle games of all time. Today, Sudoku is based on simple rules of placing the numbers from 1 to 9 in the empty cells of the Sudoku board. After solving the Sudoku, each row, column, and mini grid should have only one occurrence of each digit between 1 and 9. There are various approaches introduced to solve the Sudoku game till now. The solutions in the state of art are computationally complex as the algorithmic complexity for the solution falls under the class of NP-complete. The paper discusses various solutions for the problem along with their pros and cons. The paper also discusses the performance of a serial version solution with respect to execution time taken to solve Sudoku. With certain modifications and assumptions to the serial version code, we have evaluated the possible solution and bottleneck in the parallel approach. The results have been evaluated for the parallelized algorithm on a normal user machine first, and then on a supercomputing solution box PARAMSHAVAK. Finally, the paper is concluded with the analysis of all the three solution aspects proposed. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Crimes are treacherous and common social problem faced worldwide. Crimes affect the quality of life, economic growth, and reputation of a nation. There has been an enormous increase in crime rate in the last few years. In order to reduce the crime rate, the law enforcements need to take the preventive measures. With the aim of securing the society from crimes, there is a need for advanced systems and new approaches for improving the crime analytics for protecting their communities. Accurate real-time crime predictions help to reduce the crime rate but remains challenging problem for the scientific community as crime occurrences depend on many complex factors. In this work, various visualizing techniques and machine learning algorithms are adopted for predicting the crime distribution over an area. In the first step, the raw datasets were processed and visualized based on the need. Afterwards, machine learning algorithms were used to extract the knowledge out of these large datasets and discover the hidden relationships among the data which is further used to report and discover the crime patterns that is valuable for crime analysts to analyse these crime networks by the means of various interactive visualizations for crime prediction and hence is supportive in prevention of crimes. © 2018 The Authors.

abstract={In the current scenario, it is very difficult for the doctors to diagnose liver patient and there should be some kind of automated support based on machine intelligence that can help to diagnose in advance so that doctors start the treatment faster and save time. The machine intelligence is a way to predict the liver-related problems; in this study, the linear regression is used to predict the same, more accurately. The albumin levels are highly related in diagnosing these kinds of liver problems. The proposed model worked efficiently on 583 observations provided as well as on new datasets. The total average accuracy achieved in this proposed model was 89.34% which is much more than the previously identified research work of Wold et al.

abstract={With the growth of civilization the demand of cement concrete is increasing rapidly which increase the production of cement and abolishing the natural source of limestone. Also contributing a lot to the global warming by generating huge amount of carbon-di-oxide. Therefore the present study concentrate on the production of concrete using the geopolymerization technology which replaces cement fully by fly ash, a waste material and alkali solution. India is presently producing approximately 190 million tons of fly ash every year from moreover 145 power plants. Present research is focused on the different parameters which are curing temperature, ratio of sodium silicate to sodium hydroxide, molarity of sodium hydroxide, curing type and the results have been studied and discussed. Previous works emphasis that only the use of fly ash as the base material confine the concrete to be heat cured which limits the applicability of geopolymer concrete to cast-in-situ conditions. So some proportion of flyash is replaced by ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) and the effect on compressive and tensile strength is observed. Ambient temperature dry curing was done without any water when some proportion of fly ash was replaced by GGBFS. The ratio of sodium silicate solution to sodium hydroxide solution by mass was kept fixed at 2.5 and the concentration of sodium hydroxide was kept 14M. The ratio of flyash to alkali solution was kept 0.35 & 0.40. Replacing 40% of Flyash by GGBFS and keeping the concentration of NaOH as 14M at ambient temperature, the compressive strength encountered was 40 MPa. © 2018 Authors.},

Effects of mixed convection flow, viscous dissipation and temperature jump are also considered. The governing boundary layer equation and boundary conditions are converted into dimensionless differential equations. These converted equations are solved numerically with Runge-Kutta fourth-order method using the shooting technique. A comparative study of Newtonian fluid (pure water), copper-water nanofluid and aluminum oxide water nanofluid under the influence of various physical parameters for both moving and static wedge have been analyzed and discussed.

abstract={The last decade being a web revolution in the field of electronic media, data and information exchange in various forms has significantly increased. With the advancement in the technological aspects of the communication mechanism, the textual form of data has taken the shape of audiovisual format, and more and more content over internet is being shared in this form. Data sharing in this form calls for the need of high bandwidth consumption which may slow down the network resulting in performance degradation of content delivery networks due to congestion. Several attempts have been made by the researchers to propose various techniques and algorithms to achieve optimal performance of the network resources under high-usage circumstances. But due to high-dense network architectures, the performance implementations of suggested algorithms for congestion may not be able to produce the desired results in real time. In this paper, we have presented an optimized multi-core architecture-based parallel version of two congestion control algorithms—leaky bucket and choke packet. The experimental results over a dense network show that optimized parallel implementation using OpenMP programming specification gets the network rebalancing in a very short span of time as compared to its serial counterpart. The proposed approach runs 60% faster than the serial implementation. The graphical map for the speed up continues to increase with the size of the network and routers. The paper throws the light on the implementation aspects as well as result analysis in detail along with some existing algorithms for the problem. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.},

abstract={This paper discusses the role of Machine Learning (ML) based algorithms and methods in Big Data Processing & Analytics (BDA). ML and BDA are both evolutionary fields of computing and the developments in these fields are complementing each other. The ever changing data landscape in modern digital world have resulted in newer ways of data processing frameworks in order to get meaningful insights which are unprecedented. This paper presents a detailed review on latest developments in ML algorithms for Big Data Processing. In later section key challenges associated with application of ML based approaches are also discussed. ML based Big Data Processing has gained popularity and new developments are on the rise for efficient data processing. This field is witnessing unparalleled emergence of new methods and approaches for efficient data processing in order to discover interestingness for decision making. Thus, more and more ML based data processing approaches are being used for Big Data Processing. With the splurge data from different newer sources, heterogeneous nature of data, uncertain & unstructured data, the so called Big Data with all its characteristics (5 Vs) there is an ever increasing need to use approaches which aid in modelling and processing of these data, provide automated approach to data processing and so on. These type of new processing requirements have given a big boost to the development of new ML based methods for managing & processing them. The paper will be useful to the scholars who are researching in this interesting & challenging domain of ML and Big Data Processing. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.},

abstract={Credit risk is characterized as the risk that borrowers will neglect to pay its advance commitments and loan obligations. It is very hard to predict the outcomes (risky borrower) manually as the evaluation of large features set is quite time consuming. That’s why, we need some good predictor as classifier. The traditional k-NN is one pre-established classifier used in various domains along with credit risk predictions. The newly conceptualized ARSkNN is another such classification which reduces the runtime in predicting the outcomes and improves overall accuracy percentage of the predicted classes over Traditional k-NN. The method adopt the similarity measure which is based on the Mass estimation rather than distance estimation for predicting the K- nearest neighbor. The results were compared using WEKA 3.7.10 as tool and found significant improvement vis-á-vis the evaluation parameters by the ARSkNN method. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.},

The numbers of the vehicles are growing very rapidly which produced the problem of the parking. There are diverse techniques that have been introduced by many researchers those are used according to the need and scale. This paper is addressed the problem of vehicle parking for small scale by using the surveillance camera. A background subtraction is used to detect moving vehicle. The moving vehicles are tracked using the Gaussian mixture model and a foreground mask is created. Dilation is applied to remove inconsistent and noise particles. The variable intensity distribution is plotted on a histogram and changes are identified to count vehicles. Each parking spot can accommodate only certain numbers of vehicle. If the count has reached the maximum limit then the display unit guides the driver to next available parking spot. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={The main objective of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) is to improve driver safety and traffic efficiency. Most of VANET applications are based on periodic exchange of safety messages between nearby vehicles and between vehicles and nearby road side communication units (e.g., traffic lights, roadside lights etc.). This periodic communication generates huge amount of data that have typical storage, computation, and communication resources needs. In recent years, there have been huge developments in automotive industry, computing, and communication technologies. This has led Vehicular Cloud Computing (VCC) as a solution to satisfy the requirements of VANETs such as computing, storage, and networking resources. Fog computing is a standard that comprehends cloud computing and related services to the proximity of a network. Since VANET applications have special mobility, low latency, and location awareness requirement. Fog computing plays a significant role in VANET applications and services.

abstract={Question answering field has evolved alongside the Natural Language processing. There are several small-scale applications that use the linguistic, semantic, and syntactic interpretations of text and consume it in further processing. In case of a web search, knowing what the query is intended for can save hours of CPU processing and decrease response time tremendously. We have taken a small step in this direction by treating the query as a question and classifying it with the best suited classification algorithm. In this paper, we have tried to find out that when a perfect-informer of the question (knowing what is asked) is provided as an input for classification algorithms like SVN, Naïve Base, and decision tree, we want to observe their accuracy on the same data set of questions. In our experiment, we have used the concept of CRF to find question features that are relevant. CRF is a probabilistic model that treats features as observation sequence and emits all sequence labels with probability values. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

Partial differential equations governing flow and heat transfer have been transformed into non-linear ordinary differential equations by using suitable similarity transformations. These non-linear differential equations have been solved numerically by using shooting techniques with fourth order Runge-Kutta method. Effects of Casson fluid parameter β, rotation parameter λ, Prandtl number Pr and magnetic field parameter M on velocity profile, temperature profile and skin friction number have been analyzed and depicted through graphs and tables. Entropy generation number and Bejan number have also been obtained and discussed.},

abstract={Topological sort referred to as topo sort or topological ordering is defined as constraint-based ordering of nodes (vertices) of graph G or DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph). In other words, it gives a linearized order of graph nodes describing the relationship between the graph vertices. Many applications of various fields in computer science require a constraint-based ordering of tasks and, thus, topological sorting holds a big place of importance for many applications like semantic analysis in compiler design, Gantt chart generation in software project management and many more. In this paper, a parallel version of this ordering algorithm over CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) has been discussed by identifying an approach to process-independent portions of the graph simultaneously for load flow analysis over radial distribution networks. The serial implementation of topological sort has been first discussed followed by its implementation on thread-block architecture of CUDA modifying the serial algorithm. Finally, the efficiency of this parallel version of topo sort has been investigated on various structures of graph modeled from radial distribution networks and has been reported. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Electrokinetic transport of fluids through microchannel by micropumping and microperistaltic pumping has much interest for many engineering, medical, and industrial applications. Motivated in part by the need of mathematical model to study the electrokinetic transport by peristaltic pumping, an analytical approach is presented. A non-integral number of wave propagation is considered for transportation of fluid bolus along the channel length. Debye-Hückel linearization is employed to find out the potential function. A non-dimensional analysis is employed to simplify the governing equations. Low Reynolds number and large wavelength approximations are taken into account. The effects of characteristic electrical double layer (EDL) thickness and maximum electroosmotic velocity on pumping characteristics are discussed by computational results. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2018.},

abstract={In this paper, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) three dimensional flow of Oldroyd- B nanofluid over a bidirectional stretching surface is analyzed. By using appropriate similarity transformation, the governing partial differential equations are reducing into coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equation. These nonlinear differential equations are then solved by the Differential Transform Method (DTM) combined with Padè approximation (DTM-Padè). The influence of emerging physical parameters namely, Deborah numbers β1 and β2, Prandtl number Pr, Brownian motion parameter Nb and thermophoresis parameter Nt on the fluid velocity, temperature and concentration profile are depicted through graphs. Also a comparative study between DTM and numerical method are presented by graph and other semi-analytical techniques through tables. It is noticed that DTM can overcome the earlier restriction, assumptions and limitation of traditional perturbation method. The main advantage of this method is that DTM can be applied directly to nonlinear differential equations without using linearization and round-off errors and cannot be affected by error associated to discretization. © 2018 by the authors of the abstracts.},

abstract={The present paper is aimed to study the buckling and postbuckling response of functionally graded carbon nanotube (FG-CNT)- magnesium (Mg) nanocomposite plate with interphase effect. Interphase zone is characterized by employing a cohesive zone model for its elastic modulus and thickness. An equivalent solid fiber (ESF) of CNT and interphase is modeled and dispersed into the matrix material by utilizing random sequential adsorption (RSA) technique. The effective elastic properties of the nanocomposite are computed by finite element method (FEM) based numerical homogenization technique. The obtained elastic properties of nanocomposite are utilized to investigate the buckling and post-buckling behaviour of different functionally graded (i.e., FG) nanocomposite plates modeled by varying the volume fraction of CNT/ESF along thickness direction, under in-plane compressive loads. The non-linear formulation is based on first-order shear deformation theory and von Karman's assumptions. It is found that considering the interphase between CNT and Mg matrix would result in decrease in buckling load and postbuckling strength of FG-CNT-reinforced nanocomposite plate as compared to nanocomposite without interphase. It is also reported that the higher volume fraction of CNTs near top and bottom surfaces than the middle portion of nanocomposite plate provide better resistance to buckling and postbuckling. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.},

abstract={The cyber-security threats to low-cost end-user devices could severely undermine the expected deployment of Internet of Thing (IoT) solutions in a range of real-world applications such as environment monitoring, transportation, and manufacturing. Additionally, the huge amount of data generated by these devices posses new challenges concerning tasks such as efficient information acquisition and analysis, decision making, and action implementation. In this paper, we propose CENSOR, a novel cloud-enabled secure IoT network architecture based on SDN paradigm. We discuss the significant benefits as well as challenges that are inherent while performing integration of SDN and IoT in CENSOR. We show that the emerging software-based networking features combined with the cloud computing solutions can significantly improve the security and communication reliability in the target IoT scenarios. In particular, to provide the adequate security measures in the network, CENSOR uses a lightweight and scalable software remote attestation scheme, which ensures the integrity of the software that is being executed by the IoT devices to achieve the application specific goals in the network. We further discuss the improvements in data communication and data overhead that can be achieved in CENSOR due to its convergence with the cloud computing (at back-end) and fog computing services (at edge routers or front-end). A Smart City use-case has been considered as a target IoT scenario to analyze the feasibility and effectiveness of CENSOR concerning the communication security and the network scalability parameters. Additionally, we provide future research directions along with the recent industry initiatives that include open issues in the integration and deployment of cloud-enabled SDN-based IoT networks. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

Supervised learning methods for intrusion detection are not so effective in detection of attacks of big data. Unsupervised models are mainly used for the detection of events or attributes that occur together. A new parallel K-medoid clustering method and k-nearest neighbor classification techniques are proposed for intrusion detection for huge amount of data.

The objective of this conceptual and empirical research paper is to evaluate Shimla city's earthquake vulnerability with regard to past and present scenario of infrastructures within it, supported by local residents' perspective. This study sought out the awareness of seismicity among the residents of Shimla, their opinion and knowledge, related to earthquake resistant houses, lifeline structures, earthquake measures and trust in city authorities. The comparison between primary data and available secondary data is indicative of the high seismic vulnerability levels and concludes with suggestions, for both authorities and residents of Shimla city. © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={Region duplication or copy–move forgery is an attack in which a region of an image is copied and pasted onto another location of the same image. In the recent state–of–the–art, a number of key–point based methods have been proposed for copy–move forgery detection in digital images. Though the problems of re–scaling and rotation in region duplication, have been sufficiently investigated using key–point based methods, post-processing based attacks such as flip, blur, brightness and noise, remain an open challenge in this field. In this paper, we address the problem of copy–move forgery detection in images, plus aim to identify copied regions, having undergone different geometric (such as rotation, re–scale), and post–processing attacks (such as Gaussian noise, blurring and brightness adjustment). In the proposed algorithm we introduce a region based key–point selection concept, which is considerably more discriminative than single SIFT key–point extraction. In this work, we apply Centroid Linkage Clustering, to identify duplicated regions in an image, from matched key-points. Also, we introduce a Graph Similarity Matching algorithm, to optimize false matches. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method in terms of forgery detection and localization efficiency, for a wide range of geometric and post-processing based attacks in region duplication. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

Speech samples of ID children were recorded from a government-owned special school in India and used for the analysis. Control samples were taken from the author’s institute. Pre-processing techniques were used for better parameterization. Two classifiers, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Linear Discriminant Analysis, were applied to classify between disordered and the normal speech. Cross-validation technique was used to evaluate the reliability of the classifier. This study has discussed the effect on the classification accuracy using different values of frame size, percentage of frame overlapping, α value of pre-emphasis first-order filter and the order p. The experimental calculation interpreted that all the three parameterization techniques can be used for the correct classification of the ID speech from controls and WLPCC features slightly outperform than LPCC and considerably outperforms than LPC features. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Concurrent workflow scheduling algorithm works in three phases, namely rank computation, tasks selection, and resource selection. In this paper, we introduce a new ranking algorithm that computes the rank of a task, based on its successor rank and its predecessors average communication time, instead of its successors rank. The advantage of this ranking algorithm is that two dependent tasks are assigned to the same machine and as a result the scheduled length is reduced. The task selection phase selects a ready task from each workflow and creates a task pool. The resource selection phase initially assigns tasks using min-min heuristic, after initial assignment, tasks are moved from the highly loaded machines to the lightly loaded machines. Our resource selection algorithm increases the load balance among the resources due to tasks assignment heuristic and reassignment of tasks from the highly loaded machines. The simulation results show that our proposed scheduling algorithm performs better over existing approaches in terms of load balance, makespan and turnaround time. © 2018 Slovak Academy of Sciences.

MAAs absorb light in the range of ultraviolet-A and ultraviolet-B with a maximum absorbance between 310 and 362 nm. Due to significant UV absorption capacity, MAAs may be used in cosmetic industries for the development of an efficient sunscreens. Diverse freshwater, marine and terrestrial organisms have evolved the ability to synthesize and accumulate a variety of MAAs to overcome the damaging effects of UV radiations. Cyanobacteria might have faced the most deleterious ultraviolet radiation, which leads to an evolution of ultraviolet protecting molecules such as MAAs for efficient selection in the stressed environment. A number of MAAs have been reported from diverse taxonomic groups of cyanobacteria. This chapter organizes all the reported MAAs so far, with respect to different cyanobacterial groups. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is harmful to living organisms, causing damage to macromolecules such as DNA, RNA, proteins and lipids. Available inorganic and organic chemicals used in commercial sunscreen have deleterious activity in vivo. Therefore, there is a need of a safe and natural sunscreen. Cyanobacteria are the impressive source of natural products and they can be exploited industrially. Cyanobacteria synthesize the UV absorbing compounds like mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) and scytonemin. MAAs are water-soluble molecules (188 to 1050 Da) that absorb UV-A and UV-B radiation and disperse the energy as heat. Scytonemin is a lipid soluble pigment (544 Da) having absorption maxima at 380 nm. They are promising natural alternatives for both direct (UV-absorption) and indirect (antioxidant) protection. These molecules show strong photostability and do not have any cytotoxic effects. The search for natural UV protective molecules is relatively recent, providing two commercial products (Helioguard(r) and Helionori(r)) containing MAAs extract from red alga Porphyra umbilicalis. Still commercialization of potential photoprotective molecules is required for the development of a better and safe sunscreen. Therefore, for improvement in their expression levels, a complete understanding of biosynthetic pathway of MAAs and scytonemin is essential. Additionally, an economic and sustainable method for extraction of these molecules from cyanobacteria is also required for large-scale production. Future perspectives include the heterologous expression of MAAs and/or scytonemin in industrially friendly microorganisms in order to co-produce different UV protective molecules and thus cover a broader UV spectrum and simplify the production process. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

abstract={Two rationally designed β-carboline-imidazopyridine hybrid chromofluorescent sensors S1 and S2 have been successfully synthesized and evaluated for the selective sensing of metal ions and anions. The synthesized sensors selectively sense copper ions through a significant color change from colorless to yellow along with a shift in their absorption spectra and enhancement in their emission intensities to 'turn on' the fluorescence mode in preference to other metal ions. Moreover, sensors S1 and S2 also recognize fluoride ions via H-bond interaction and subsequent deprotonation to elicit a color change from colorless to yellow conspicuous to the naked eye. Detailed UV-visible analyses revealed that the sensors interact with copper ions in a 1: 1 binding stoichiometry with a detection range of 10-7 M. In addition, competing binding studies by UV-visible analyses revealed that the sensors exhibit more selectivity toward copper ions in comparison to fluoride ions. These experimental results were further corroborated by DFT (Density Functional Theory) calculations. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.},

abstract={In the present research, MD simulations have been employed to study the mechanical properties of epoxy DGEBA with and without reinforcement of CNT. A triangular cross link rigid structure has been created using Material Studio (MS) software. An amorphous cell has been created which is a reprensentative composite. All the simulations have been carried out using Forcite module of Material Studio. Mechanical properties with and without reinforcement of CNT have been obtained. It has been found that at room temperature, Young's modulus of DGEBA-DETDA composite is 2.429 GPa while after reinforcement of CNT, Young's modulus increased to 13.27 GPa. The MD simulation results indicate that the Young's modulus of the reinforced composites and the epoxy matrix decrease with increase in strain rate (from 0.0 to 0.1). MD simulation results show that at any given strain rate, CNT reinforced epoxy composite is 5 times stiffer than the pure epoxy matrix. © 2018, Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University.},

abstract={A cellular automaton is one of the most engrossing fields of studies. At the present digital world where almost every communication is being done via the Internet, requirement of security and privacy of information is a must. For securing big or small data over Internet, cryptographic techniques are essential. Usage of cellular automata characteristics in the field of cryptography is still not much explored. Here, the paper presents a symmetric key cryptographic technique of block cipher using cellular automata (CA) rules. Proposed methodology has been implemented in C. This cryptographic technique uses non-complemented cellular automata rules and hybrid CA rule vector to form group cellular automata that would be used to encrypt and decrypt the data. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) are fast replacing incandescent lamps and CFLs in most of the developing nations. The reason can be attributed mainly to the enhanced lifetime and less energy consumption as compared to the other mentioned types. However one important aspect needs attention, the impact of driver on LEDs. LEDs are current controlled devices and hence emit maximum light with increase in current input to the device. This feature, boost up the light output but it increases the junction temperature of the device. Hence additional heat sinks are required to vent out the excessive heat generated due to increase current input to the LEDs. Those additional heat sinks are at times difficult to accommodate. So, designers have made arrangements to vent out the heat from the device. This is achieved by designing fins. However this arrangement is not suitable in places where the ambient temperature is more than normal. Thus, design of LED driver with controlled current input is essential in order to maintain the thermal limit of the device. Secondly, the AC-DC LEDs driver circuits, which are available in the market, are seldom equipped with input power factor and THD improvement circuitry as prescribed in IEC61000- 3-2. This is essential for maintaining the energy efficiency of the nearest utility services and in addition also improves on the current drawn by the device. The following work envisages these issues and proposes corrective driver circuit based on two different driver topologies, buck-boost topology and flyback topology. Both these topologies are proposed in order to address the aspects of power quality and its impact on the life of the device. The simulation were done using Green Point simulation tool from On Semiconductors. © 2018, LLC Editorial of Journal "Light Technik". All rights reserved.},

In this paper, different types of analog circuits exhibiting nonlinear dynamics have been reviewed. It has been shown that such circuits can generate signals which have frequency spectrum characteristics similar to noise. This leads to an important conclusion that a low-cost spread spectrum-based secure communication model can be developed using analog circuits. A few of the secure communication models developed using these analog circuits have also been reviewed.

Data from the corresponding sensors of EO-I, LANDSAT and IRS (i.e., Hyperion, ETM+ and LISS III respectively) were used to discriminate satellite signals of Hematite and Uranium ores from these locations. For the data of Hyperion being hyper-spectral, correction mechanism were performed through relevant algorithms: Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Hypercube (FLAASH) to remove atmospheric aerosol effects, Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) to remove noise, Pixel Purity Index (PPI) to get spectrally the most pure pixel and Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) in order to match the spectral similarity between an image pixel spectrum and a referenced spectrum. The data achieved from ETM+ had line-stripping, and thus were restored. On the LISS III data, vegetation had to be, virtually, removed from the images of the Indian sites, using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), in order to equate them with that from the Niger site. The processed data was put to a common platform statistically. Segregation of Uranium, a radioactive ore, from Hematite, a non-radioactive iron ore, could be achieved up to 82.35% using TOPSIS and 90% using pair-wise Student’s t-Test.

abstract={Technologies such as the integration of distributed generations (DGs) and shunt capacitors (SCs) are key for realising smart distribution systems. These technologies may be coordinated together to get better solutions so that distribution systems can achieve optimum performance. This study proposes a long-term distribution system planning methodology to determine the optimal sizing and siting of SCs and mix of dispatchable and intermittent DGs. More practical formulations are suggested while considering realities of modern distribution systems with reference to the stochastic nature of load demand and power generation among distribution buses on account of diversity, variability and uncertainty. The long-term costs in the proposed planning model include several techno-economic and social objectives pertaining to investment, operation and maintenance of these distributed resources and the revenue generated by sale of electricity to customers and the utility grid. The proposed planning model is more practical as it fully considers the system uncertainties and variability in load and power generation which are efficiently handled by introducing deterministic self-adaptive uncertainty model. The case study on a standard test distribution system being modified by wind turbines, photovoltaic generators and microturbines demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The results of study are investigated and presented. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2017},

From a security point of view, there are two particular issues: securing the app stores or app databases with its source of information in big data context and utilizing big data procedures to break down, and even anticipate, security flaws. The main issue arise that many hackers or attackers are targeting mobile big data in the form of signaling big data, mobile traffic big data, location-based big data, and heterogeneous data in app store. In this paper, we are taking Android-based mobile operating system for experimental setup. This paper contains an extraction technique to extract the malware in different big data context and also analysis of these malware. We have worked with many Mallarme family (as approx 40 K malware) in mobile big data and result of the whole analysis is approx 90% to identify the current malware in mobile big data. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Today, clustering for Sensor Node (SN) is a method in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) to diminish the energy consumption of the SN by avoiding long distance communication between the SNs. This will protract the lifetime of sensor networks. However, a cluster head has to perform various tasks such as collection of data from member nodes, aggregation of the collected data, and send that data to the BS. Network load balance is a challenging issue in WSNs for the clustering schemes. Genetic algorithms (GA) with clustering schemes are implemented for better cluster formation. The GA run through again over a large no of iterations to find the optimal solution that leads to premature convergence. The chaotic GA (CGA) will solve this problem by avoiding local convergence, i.e., by choosing a chaotic map to generate the random values instead of traditional random function and improves the performance of the traditional GA. A chaotic GA (CGA) based clustering algorithm for WSNs has been proposed in the proposed work that has better convergence rate for cluster head selection and consequently improves the performance of sensor network. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

The paper applied exploratory factor analysis on a sample of 504 respondents to condense a set of 57 unorganized retail stores' attributes into a list of six factors. Subsequently, a conceptual model depicting the relationships between retail experience, customer satisfaction, and behavioral intention was developed and analyzed through structural equation modeling. This research is a first of its kind that has been conducted on Indian unorganized retail setting covering issues of retail experience, customer satisfaction, and behavioral intention together in a single model. The research revealed that four factors: customershopping motivation, sales associates, retail ambience, and product assortment had a significant impact on retail experience of unorganized shoppers. However, only product assortment and customized services/relationship had a significant positive influence on customer satisfaction. The results also showed a significant relationship between retail experience, customer satisfaction, and behavioral intention.},

abstract={Adverse drug reactions represent the unwanted or undesired effects of drugs. Timely extraction of such effects is highly required so that early warnings can be raised against if any serious beforehand to save patients from any further loss. It also helps in framing alternate treatment plan. There are two different ways for identifying the side effects of drugs. First is premarketing trials, which are conducted before floating drugs into market. But this approach is not as effective as these trials are carried out on a restricted population for restricted time. That is why another approach called as postmarketing surveillance is used. Under this approach, data mining techniques have been applied frequently for finding adverse reactions of drugs. But most of the existing techniques are based on the assumption that all attributes are equally responsible for drug side effects which may not be applicable for all real-life cases. In this paper, we study the role of different patients and drug attributes in manifestation of adverse drug reactions using clustering technique. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.},

abstract={The automatic speech recognition systems are designed for human–computer interaction in trouble-free mode. Speech recognition has vast applications. Text to speech and speech to text transformations are mostly used segments in ASR. Perfect speech recognition is done by choosing proper extraction and classification techniques with respect to slang and pitch of the language. Telugu is a south Indian language which has around 120 million speakers. There are various feature extraction techniques such as LPC, MFCC, MODGDF, RASTA, DTW and ZCPA. This paper deals with the combined techniques and its comparison with individual techniques. The rate of features extracted in joint extraction techniques gives promising results comparatively with individual technique. Techniques MFCC, MODGDF and ZCPA are combined, and joint features are extracted. The next stage is to classify the features where selected technique using neural networks. Features are classified by NTN and MNTN classifiers for speaker-dependent recognition and presented by using closed and open sets. The MNTN is evaluated for several speaker recognition experiments. These include closed- and open-set speaker identification and speaker verification. The MNTN is found to perform better than NTN classifier.

abstract={Telugu is the standard language used to communicate mainly in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana states with approximately 100 million speakers. Every Telugu word ends with vowels. Automatic speech recognition has major applications in the smart world. Telugu speech recognition has a huge scope of research from past decade. This paper deals with Telugu speech recognition in a speaker-dependent format for 10 words which are numbers from one to ten uttered by 10 speakers which creates a data base of 100 samples. Numbers are very frequently spoken words where recognition of these words plays a major role in Telugu speech recognition. These spoken words are preprocessed using various techniques like de-noising, framing, sampling, transformations, and endpoint detection. Methods like mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and combined MFCC with modified group delay functions (MODGDF) are used for extracting the features. Extracted features are used for training and testing phase. Multilayer perceptron (MLP) and time lagged recurrent neural network (TLRN) patterns are trained and tested. Comparison is done for MLP and TLRN with the feature extraction techniques MFCC and MODGDF-MFCC.

abstract={The flow characteristics of nanofluids flow driven by combined effects of electroosmosis and peristalsis are very important for designing bio-mimetic pumping systems at the micro scale of interest in physiological treatment e.g. ocular drug delivery systems. The flow characteristics of thermally developed nanofluids flow are investigated in presence of peristalsis and electroosmosis phenomena. Thermal radiation effect is also introduced. Tapered asymmetric microchannels are imposed at the walls to mimic sophisticated peristaltic wave propagation scenarios. The nanofluid is employed as the working fluid, and the analytical solution for electro-osmotic flow is obtained by virtue of the Debye–Hückel linearization. The dimensional conservation equations are linearized under lubrication theory approximations. The effects of emerging physical parameters namely Grashof numbers, Brownian motion parameter, thermophoresis parameter, Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity, Debye length and thermal radiation on flow characteristics, heat transfer characteristics, and pumping characteristics are computed. Furthermore, an inherent phenomenon of peristaltic pumping known as trapping is also presented graphically under the influence of pertinent parameters and discussed in brief. Validation of present model is also presented. This model is mainly applicable to study cell responses, blood analysis, biomimetic capillary designs, and blood vessel tissue culture systems. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

The deployment of phasor measurement units (PMUs) at key locations provides an opportunity for devising effective power system monitoring and control measures. In this study, a new method is proposed to determine the real-time transient stability status and identification of the coherent generator groups by predicting the rotor angle values following a large disturbance through radial basis function neural network. The first six cycles of synchronously sampled post-fault data measurements from PMUs consisting of rotor angles and voltages of generators are taken as the input to the neural network to predict the future state of the system. The proposed method can also determine the synchronism state of the individual machine in real time. The proposed scheme is demonstrated on the IEEE-39 bus test system at different operating conditions. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Present study deals with the binary batch adsorption of aniline (AN) and nitrobenzene (NB) onto granular-activated carbon (GAC). For single component, the adsorptive uptake of AN and NB increased and percent removal decreased with an increase in initial adsorbate concentration. The AN loading capacity of GAC was enhanced from 1.41 to 17 mg/g for the changes in initial AN concentration (C0,AN) from 23 to 540 mg/L. Similarly, the NB loading capacity was increased from 2.05 to 37.4 mg/g for the changes in C0,NB from 21 to 392 mg/L. The single component equilibrium adsorption uptake of AN and NB was best-fitted by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) isotherm model. The single-component BET constant, qm, for NB and AN are found to be about 50.01 and 15.57 mg/g, respectively. The equilibrium adsorption capacity data is well represented by extended Langmuir model.

In recent years, it has however become clear that physical activity is equally important for managing OI in both children and adults. Exogenous mechanical stimulation e.g. prophylactic exercises may be useful in improving the bone mass and strength of OI bones as loading-induced mechanical components e.g. normal strain and canalicular fluid flow stimulate remodeling activities. Several studies have characterized the strain environment in OI bones, whereas, very few studies attempted to characterize the canalicular fluid flow. In the present study, we anticipate that canalicular fluid flow reduces in OI bone as compared to healthy bone under physiological loading. This work accordingly computes the canalicular fluid distribution in the single osteon model of OI and control/normal bones subjected to normal physiological loadings. A transversely isotropic poroelastic model of osteon is developed. Loading is applied in accordance with gait cycles reported for OI and healthy bones. Fluid distribution patterns computed for OI and healthy bones are compared at different time-points of stance phase of the gait cycle. A significant reduction in fluid flow is observed in case of OI bone as compared to healthy bone. This clearly indicates that improvements in physical activities or exercises can be designed to enhance the level of canalicular fluid flow to initiate possible osteogenic activities and the bone.

abstract={The current investigation involves the green synthesis of copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) from an aqueous plant extract of Moringa oleifera Lam by two methods: (I) time-based approach and (II) heat treatment of aqueous solution. Prepared CuNPs were characterised via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and transmission EM. The study also reveals the potential bioactivity of the prepared CuNPs. In vitro anti-microbial efficiency of CuNPs was estimated against bacterial and fungal strains by the agar well diffusion method. Anti-oxidant capacity of CuNPs was determined using ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP), lipid peroxidation (LPO) and peroxidase assays, while the antiplatelet potential was determined by measuring two haemostatic parameters (PT & APTT assay). The minimum inhibitory concentration was observed at 60 µg/ml against Streptomyces griseus and Aspergillus Niger when NPs were prepared by method II. CuNPs prepared by the method I showed higher FRAP and LPO activities, while increased POX activity was found in CuNPs prepared by method II. CuNPs prepared using method I also showed better anti-oxidant and antiplatelet potential. It was observed that M. oleifera-derived CuNPs exhibits strong anti-microbial, anti-oxidant and APTT potential. This indicates potential utilization of green synthesized NPs for various industrial and therapeutic strategies. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2017.},

abstract={Software-defined networks (SDNs) decouple the data plane from the control plane. Thus, it provides logically centralized visibility of the entire networking infrastructure to the controller. It enables the applications running on top of the control plane to innovate through network management and programmability. To envision the centralized control and visibility, the controller needs to discover the networking topology of the entire SDN infrastructure. However, discovering and maintaining a global view of the underlying network topology is a challenging task because of (i) frequently changing network topology caused by migration of the virtual machines in the data centers, mobile, end hosts and change in the number of data plane switches because of technical faults or network upgrade; (ii) lack of authentication mechanisms and scarcity in SDN standards; and (iii) availability of security solutions during topology discovery process. To this end, the aim of this paper is threefold. First, we investigate the working methodologies used to achieve global view by different SDN controllers, specifically, POX, Ryu, OpenDaylight, Floodlight, Beacon, ONOS, and HPEVAN. Second, we identify vulnerabilities that affect the topology discovery process in the above controller implementation. In particular, we provide a detailed analysis of the threats namely link layer discovery protocol (LLDP) poisoning, LLDP flooding, and LLDP replay attack concerning these controllers. Finally, to countermeasure the identified risks, we propose a novel mechanism called TILAK which generates random MAC destination addresses for LLDP packets and use this randomness to create a flow entry for the LLDP packets. It is a periodic process to prevent LLDP packet-based attacks that are caused only because of lack of verification of source authentication and integrity of LLDP packets. The implementation results for TILAK confirm that it covers targeted threats with lower resource penalty. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={An ultra-wideband antenna (UWB) is presented in this paper, having the properties of small size and high return loss. Simulations and measurements show that the antenna which is designed in this paper has nearly omnidirectional radiation patterns on the transmission band and achieves a good gain, which enables it to be used for different UWB applications. It is designed using FR-4 (Lossy) substrate which is low cost and commercially available and the model is validated through extensive simulations performed in CST MWS 2014. The proposed design is achieved using 3 steps with each step resulting in a great enhancement in the bandwidth. The proposed antenna works for frequencies from 8 – 17.6 GHz resulting in a huge bandwidth of 9.6 GHz. The proposed antenna provides this huge bandwidth with a minimal size of 24×28 mm2. The results are evident that the proposed antenna can be used for all Ku-Band (12-18 GHz) and X-Band (8-12 GHz) applications including Radar and Satellite Communications and Weather Monitoring.

abstract={This paper proposes a unique microstrip patch antenna which has a hexagonal fractal pattern which can mainly be used for ground based surveillance radar applications. To further optimize the functioning of the antenna, multiple slots have been added to the ground plane, and a stepped pattern has been implemented to increase the current density and the gain. A detailed study of the stages of development of the antenna has been made, illustrating the effect that various design elements have on the operating characteristics of the final design. There is specific emphasis on the use of slots in the ground plane. Variations in return loss, gain, VSWR, operating frequency and bandwidth with changes in the design of the ground plane have been documented. The antenna is designed to perform in the X-band, more specifically around 9 GHz, making it well suited for short range search. The final iteration of the antenna design, including various stages of slotting in the ground plane, works at 8.7 GHz, which is well within the X-band range, and has a return loss of around 30 dB. © 2018 Authors.},

abstract={When machine learning algorithms are applied to huge amount of data, we found difficulties to process such huge data. Now new approaches are being adopted because existing machine learning libraries doesn't have enough resources to process large datasets. So new libraries (CUDA, MapReduce, and Dryad) are adding up for concepts like parallel computing. Here we will take account of GraphLab, Apache MahoutTM, and Jubatus to get the exposure of famous academics and industrial results. Looking at the traditional machine learning techniques, tasks like to handle the data which is distributed identically or in batch mode becomes impossible and there is requirement to develop new algorithms to overcome with the existing difficulties faced by these traditional ML algorithms. The objective of this chapter is to provide overall view of developed algorithms and paradigm shifts of current big data analysis using machine learning approach to compute data. Here we will explore that the machine learning field has great impact on cloud computing paradigm. In first step we deploy various tool to the cloud like libraries and statistics tools. In second step we embed plugins with current tools in order to make Hadoop cluster on the cloud so that working programs can run on it. In third step libraries of machine learning algorithms are deployed and used for data intensive computing. © 2018 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In our day-to-day life, a system never works on the conditions specified while it was being designed. Hence, it becomes necessary to include the uncertainties present in these systems while obtaining the optimized conditions. These uncertainties present in a reliability model can be handled well if the probabilistic constraints of such models are satisfied. This paper is directed to handle these probabilistic constraints of a reliability-based design optimization model (RBDO). For this purpose, one of the most efficient and precise optimization tools, namely genetic algorithm (GA), has been used. The basic principle of GAs involves the combination of the fittest string structures which are generated through numerous random iterations. The main objective of this paper is to incorporate the efficient function of a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) in a code formulated in ‘C’ language which is designed in a manner such that it is capable to handle the probabilistic constraints of a RBDO model. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.},

abstract={Over the years, a large array of multimedia services started using mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) due to its attractive features such as low-cost quick deployment, node mobility, and distributed networking. However, multimedia applications also require provisioning of adequate quality of service (QoS) to enhance quality of experience (QoE) of end users. In order to provide QoS in a network, the accurate knowledge of the remaining network resources at any time is the key. But, due to the inherent characteristics of MANETs such as dynamic topology, high bit-error-rate communication channels, and decentralized control, estimating remaining network resources is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel remaining bandwidth estimation algorithm which considers the node (or link) mobility into consideration while performing dynamic bandwidth estimation on a node. The estimated link bandwidth value is then used during the route discovery process to select routes with adequate bandwidth and thus increases the QoS of the data flow. The proposed algorithm is verified using real-time video traffic (i.e., H.264/SVC encoded video traces) using a industry standard simulator called Qualnet. The simulation results show that the proposed approach increases the decision accuracy of the soft admission control process and thus leads to the enhancement of the quality of the received video traffic. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={This paper presents a monopole ultra wideband (UWB) antenna with reconfigurable notched characteristic. The proposed antenna is capable to switch its resonance from 5.2 GHz centre frequency band-notched UWB to 8.2 GHz centre frequency band-notched UWB applications. It consists of H-shaped reconfigurable parasitic resonator in ground plane to obtain the band notched at 5.2 and 8.2 GHz centre frequency bands by the mean of two p-i-n diodes. The impedance bandwidth enhancement of the antenna is achieved by inserting a slot in the ground plane. The proposed antenna is optimized and simulated using CST—microwave studio software. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Background: Human height is a classic polygenic trait and currently available data explains only 10% of the phenotypic variation in height. Almost 60%-80% of the children coming to pediatric and endocrinology outpatient department for the evaluation of short stature are still labeled as idiopathic. Objectives: The aim of this study is to identify various chromosomal alterations causing idiopathic short stature (ISS) and short stature with dysmorphic features not pertaining to known genetic syndromes. Materials and Methods: After exclusion of all nutritional, systemic, endocrine, and syndromic causes of short stature, 19 patients with height <2 standard deviation scores were subjected to chromosomal microarray (CMA) study using Affymetrix CytoScan 750K array and CMA Scanner 3000 platform. Results: We identified total 61 copy-number variant (CNV) and polymorphs (33 gains, 11 loss, and 17 gain-mosaics) not described as normal variants in database of genomic variations. We identified SHOX haploinsufficiency as a cause of short stature in two patients, whereas one patient was gain-mosaic for SHOX. All three had normal conventional karyotype. One of these patients also had deletion of PAX3, which could be the cause of both short stature and associated mild intellectual impairment in this patient. We also found a long noncoding RNA, namely, KIAA0125 and a pseudogene ADAM6 in 18 out of our 19 patients which might have a regulatory role. Conclusion: This study shows that CMA is a very promising tool for the identification of pathogenic CNVs in patients with ISS. It can also help to identify novel genes controlling height and can open up new insight into pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying ISS, and thus may help to unfold new therapeutic targets for treatment of this condition. The association of CNV having genes for long noncoding RNAs, such as KIAA0125 and pseudogene such as ADAM6 with ISS suggest that they may play a role in controlling the expression of height-related genes and it needs further investigations. © 2018 Indian Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism.},

abstract={In this paper, a single notched band at 5.2 GHz with complementary split ring resonator (CSRR) ultra-wideband (UWB) antenna and its implementation in designing of two-element multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) with high and uniform isolation are experimentally demonstrated. The proposed UWB MIMO consists of a T-shaped stub in ground plane in between antenna elements of the size of λat3.1 GHz/4 to achieve minimum 20 dB isolation, which is almost uniform in entire UWB band. The size of the UWB MIMO antenna is 0.31λat3.1 GHz × 0.434λat3.1 GHz × 0.008λat3.1 GHz mm3 , and it is printed on an RT/duroid 5880 substrate (εr = 2.2, tan δ = 0.0009), which leads to good gain and high total efficiency of the antenna in operating bands. The simulated and measured results show good agreement for the impedance bandwidth (|S11 | &lt; −10 dB) and isolation (|S21 | &lt; −20 dB) in most of the operating band, excluding the notched band at 5.2 GHz in UWB range. The simulated, measured and calculated MIMO antenna diversity parameters prove that the antenna is suitable for UWB MIMO systems. © 2018, Electromagnetics Academy. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Combined effects of thermal radiation and variable viscosity on a time-dependent boundary-layer flow of magnetic nanofluids over a rotating disk in the presence of the porous medium have been numerically investigated. To carry out the study, hydrocarbon based magnetic nanofluid containing magnetite Fe3O4 particles of 10 nm with magnetic phase concentration of 10% has been taken. For numerical solutions of the modelled system containing the governing equation of the flow, a MATLAB tool ODE45 is employed with shooting technique for the initial guess of the unknown boundary conditions. The flow phenomenon and heat transfer on the plate surface are characterised by various flow parameters such as viscosity variations, unsteady rotation parameter, Prandtl number, and radiation parameter. Also, a comparative thermal analysis has been carried out for magnetic nanofluids having three different bases viz. hydrocarbon, fluorocarbon, and water. Results reveal that heat transfer rate of hydrocarbon base magnetic nanofluids is 73.4511% faster than water base magnetic nanofluids, and 239.7458% faster than fluorocarbon base magnetic nanofluids. This enhanced heat transfer capacity of hydrocarbon base magnetic nanofluids will help in improving the performance of oil and ore extraction drilling systems used in mining industry and other geothermal applications. © 2018 Society of Thermal Engineers of Serbia.},

abstract={A modified microbial polysaccharide based biopolymer has been investigated as a potential candidate towards development of sustainable biomaterials and bioplastics. An in-depth study was carried out to biosynthesize, characterize and assess any possible mutagenic potential and ecotoxicity of the microbial polysaccharide biopolymer. Microstructural investigations using confocal microscopy, Fourier transform (FT)-Raman depth profile mapping and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the biosynthetically modified polysaccharide revealed internal structural perturbations, as well as occlusion of granular pores by extraneous materials. The Raman 3D mapping depth profile along with time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry also indicated important structural and surface modifications, which could be correlated to the production of microbial exopolysaccharides and secondary metabolites. The study then looked into any possible genetic mutation and ecological risks associated with the biosynthetically modified polysaccharide through the investigation of genotoxicity and ecotoxicity. The genotoxicity study was carried out through bacterial reverse gene mutation (Ames) test by using two different strains (TA98 and TA100) of bacteria. The results did not indicate any mutagenic effect against either of the strains used for the biopolymer samples and was found to be genotoxically safe. Ecotoxicity tests, carried out using bioluminescent bacteria Vibrio fisheri further indicated no ecotoxicity within the given experimental conditions. The study measured the half maximal effective concentration (EC50) to cause a 50% decrease in the light output of the bacteria, a measure of ecotoxicological response of the biopolymer. Overall, results from this study indicated that the novel biopolymer was genotoxically and ecotoxically safe, which offers immense potential for future use of this biopolymer. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Recently, there is a great concern in developing integrated microfluidic platforms for biological analysis systems that can perform general biochemistry and biological analysis. Dielectrophoresis, the movement of particles in a non-uniform electric field is widely used to separate viable and non viable cells with good efficiency. The present study aims to develop a universal bio-particle separator in a C-serpentine geometry which could separate particles by varying the operating conditions. We present the design, fabrication and testing for continuous separation structure based on dielectrophoretic forces. The C-Serpentine geometry is composed of consecutive C shaped curves to generate a gradient required for the dielectrophoretic effect. Known mixture of viable and non viable cells of Saccharomyces Cerevisiae was selectively trapped using negative dielectrophoretic force generated by microelectrodes. Through measurement of cell count, a trapping efficiency of 86% was obtained for mixed cell suspension and 93–98% trapping efficiency was obtained in case of trapping live and dead yeast cells individually. Also the results show that cell viability was not affected by the separation procedure as percentage of viable cells was calculated to be 96%. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The semi-arid mangroves of the Gulf of Kachchh, the largest ecosystems on the west coast of India, are poorly studied in terms of vegetation structure and environmental parameters in spite of their conservation significance. Therefore, it is necessary to document the structural features of these mangroves in view of ongoing coastal industrial development. Mangrove forest structure in 10 locations on the northern and southern coasts of the Gulf of Kachchh were assessed using the line intercept transect method. Descriptions included density of young and mature age classes, tree heights, diameters at breast height (DBH) and aboveground biomass, along with seven significant environmental variables. Mature tree densities ranged from 350 to 1567 ind. ha−1, while average height and girth at breast height ranged from 1.0 to 6.8 m and 3.0 to 137.0 cm, respectively. The majority of trees (55.6%) were in ≤ 1.8 m height class followed by a 1.9 to 2.4 m class (25.1%). DBH was most often in class 2 cm or lower than that. Among the canopy index classes, more trees were recorded in class ≤ 2 cm. The regeneration density was greater than the recruitment class. This study indicates that the poor structural attributes of Avicennia marina Vierth. var. acutissima Stapf and Mold dominated mangroves are largely due to aridity induced by scarce and erratic rainfall and high soil and water salinities. The results should be valuable in conserving and sustainably managing these mangroves in the face of developmental activities. © 2018, Northeast Forestry University and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Background: Memories occupy the majority of chip area, and the response time for any system depends on its memory too. So, SRAMs are critical to the speed of processor operations and thus need to be rigorously optimized. The optimizations have to be in such a way that the constraints of better performance as well as reliability are met. Methods/Statistical analysis: The proposed bit cell is compared with conventional 6T bit cell for access time, read stability, on-current,and off-current, and the suitable sense amplifiers and decoder are analyzed. Findings: The proposed architecture for SRAM design meets the criteria of faster access time and read stability as compared to the conventional 6T SRAM. Write 1 operation achieves a rise of 16%, while write 0 and read 1 are better than 6T by 70 and 90%, respectively. The design was implemented on 28 nm FD-SOI platform. Application/Improvements: The proposed design has the better read stability as compared to the conventional 6T SRAM bit cell design. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Body centric wireless communication is an emerging and active area of research for many applications such as identification, tracking, healthcare systems and radio frequency-linked telemetry. In this paper, on-body performance and analysis of various wearable square-shaped spiral cut MSPAs are investigated by measuring reflection coefficient, radiation pattern and impact of human body equivalent model. This antenna basically covers the industrial, scientific and medical band (ISM 2.45 GHz) which can be used for wearable applications in the field of health care and telemetry. In particular, designing and analysis are focused on the performance of a miniaturized square-shaped spiral cut MSPA for body centric wireless communication. The characterization of proposed antenna is analysed using numerical equivalent of three-layered canonical model of skin, fat and tissue. For all types of wearable square-shaped spiral cut MSPA, the main parameter under study is reflection coefficient and the effect of novel double C structured square-shaped spiral cut MSPA with miniaturized designs. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

They show good corrosion inhibition efficiency; with the inhibition efficiency of MBNH being higher than that of HBNH. The polarisation results indicate that both the inhibitors act as mixed type inhibitors. They follow Langmuir adsorption isotherm.

The commonness of mobile phones and their inexpensive MEMS (Micro Electro Mechanical Systems) is exploited in this paper to derive meaningful information. The GPS-denied environment enables the projection of accuracy of location tracking. The scope of this paper is public transport vehicles like buses, metros, shuttles, tubes, trains, airplanes. An experiment is conducted using multiple phones at different locations within the same vehicle. We collect the MEMS sensor readings of various phones within an area and subject them to preprocessing, storing, analyzing and real-time comparing with each other. The concept here is that the readings will be similar, especially at notable data points like turns or acceleration/decelerations. The huge amount of sensor readings from various phones implies dealing with Big Data. The data analysis method used in the paper does not require calibrating the phone sensors. © 2017 IEEE.},

Observation of extended tail of spatial charge density distribution, larger charge radius and study of proton single particle states, Fermi energy and the wave functions indicate 2p halo like structure which supports direct 2p emission. The Coulomb and centrifugal barriers in experimentally identified 2p unbound 22Si show a quasi-bound state that ensures enough life time for such experimental probes.

abstract={One of the most crucial components in the computing devices is the full adders. The efficiency and effectiveness of arrays of full adders is essential; thus making it sensible to put in a reasonable effort towards improvisation of computational devices. In this paper, a new 1-BIT Full Adder (FA) with a combination of pass transistor logic and transmission gate logic is suggested. This new hybrid adder is having only 18 transistors. The proposed full adder is a CNTFET based design and also implemented 8-BIT Ripple carry Adder (RCA) at 32 nm CNTFET model files using the Cadence virtuoso tool. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={In this research study, empirical mathematical models for cutting forces and surface roughness have been developed to investigate the effect of axial depth of cut, feed, radial depth of cut and cutting speed in high-speed ball-end milling of Al2014-T6. Ball-end milling experiments have been planned using central composite design based on response surface methodology. The mathematical models have been established and tested for adequacy. A full quadratic model has been adopted for modelling. It has been found that axial depth of cut is the most dominant cutting parameter for the tangential and axial cutting forces, accounting for 49.38 and 47.12% contributions, respectively. Radial depth of cut is the most dominant parameter for radial force and contributes 69.94% for it. Results also revealed that force components decrease with increase in cutting speed. There is very small variation in cutting force components in the cutting speed range of 75–150 m/min at lower values of axial and radial depth of cut. Surface roughness is effected by cutting speed largely followed by feed. Multi-objective optimization has been performed using composite desirability to optimize the cutting parameters for minimum surface roughness and cutting forces simultaneously. Confirmation tests have been conducted using optimal set of cutting parameters. The results of confirmation tests are very close to the predicted results. © 2017, The Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering.},

abstract={Designing of a type-II nanoscale heterostructure and simulating their optical properties is critical for many applications and remains a challenge. This paper reports designing of a complex type – II ‘W’ shaped symmetric InGaAsP/GaAsSb nano-scale heterostructure grown on InP substrate and mechanism of the transitions taking place within the heterostructure which are responsible for optical properties. In addition, the band alignment, optical gain and lasing wavelength are also studied under the effect of applied external electric field ranging from 10 to 200 kV/cm and variable temperature. On the basis of outcome of the calculations, the proposed heterostructure can be claimed to show a very high optical gain (∼8000/cm) within the MIR (mid infrared) region. Moreover, the results achieved in the study suggest that the application of the both variable temperature and applied external electric field on the heterostructure can control the optical gain as well as lasing wavelength linearly. Due to the linear behavior of the proposed heterostructure, the tunable type –II InGaAsP/GaAsSb nano-scale heterostructure can be claimed as a very suitable heterostructure for the designing of photovoltaic devices operating in the IR region. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Here we report an in-silico approach for identification, characterization and validation of deleterious non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) in the interleukin-8 gene using three steps. In first step, sequence homology-based genetic analysis of a set of 50 coding SNPs associated with 41 rsIDs using SIFT (Sorting Intolerant from Tolerant) and PROVEAN (Protein Variation Effect Analyzer) identified 23 nsSNPs to be putatively damaging/deleterious in at least one of the two tools used. Subsequently, structure-homology based PolyPhen-2 (Polymorphism Phenotyping) analysis predicted 9 of 23 nsSNPs (K4T, E31A, E31K, S41Y, I55N, P59L, P59S, L70P and V88D) to be damaging. According to the conditional hypothesis for the study, only nsSNPs that score damaging/deleterious prediction in both sequence and structural homology-based approach will be considered as 'high-confidence' nsSNPs. In step 2, based on conservation of amino acid residues, stability analysis, structural superimposition, RSMD and docking analysis, the possible structural-functional relationship was ascertained for high-confidence nsSNPs. Finally, in a separate analysis (step 3), the IL-8 deregulation has also appeared to be an important prognostic marker for detection of patients with gastric and lung cancer. This study, for the first time, provided in-depth insights on the effects of amino acid substitutions on IL-8 protein structure, function and disease association. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={Travelling Salesperson Problem being a classic combinatorial optimization problem is an interesting but a challenging problem to be solved. It falls under the class of NPhard problem and becomes non-solvable for large data set by traditional methods like integer linear programming and branch and bound method, being the earlier popular approaches. Genetic Algorithm based solutions emerged as the most popular tool to solve this which is a heuristic mechanism to find the closest approximate solution to the problem. In this paper, we approach Travelling Salesman Problem using GA approach, a natural selection technique which repeatedly modifies a population of individual solutions, with the added power of modern computing systems. Here we come up with a parallel version of GA for both multicore and many core architectures over OpenMP and CUDA in order to make some of the challenging problems like Vehicle Routing Problem for google maps, DNA sequencing and many more optimization problems involving a good amount of complex computation and data handling. The paper presents a comparative analysis of the results for both CUDA and OpenMP for various degree and structure of graphs depicting close approximation to the accuracy in terms of most optimal path for traversal with highly reduced execution time. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper predict the effect of the object's morphology on the final accuracy of the scanned data, for the case of contactless laser scanning. On the basis of the scanned objects morphology, two important process parameters are specified namely scanning angle and distance of the laser from the part surface. Experiments have been performed with different scanning conditions using full factorial design. An analytical prediction model for determining the standard deviation of the final surface is developed in terms of the aforesaid scanning parameters using response surface methodology (RSM). Furthermore, the optimal scanning parameters are predicted after comparing two almost unexplored nature inspired algorithms i.e. Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) and Moth-Flame Optimization (MFO). Finally, two realistic non-trivial case studies are considered for validation of the proposed methodology. The result shows that the standard deviation of the final reverse engineered models significantly reduced by 21.6% and 13.77%. The adopted methodology provides the optimal combination of morphological scanning process parameters with a considerable reduction in standard deviation for final scanned surface models. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter Berlin/Boston.},

Few attempts considering the non-rigidity had been published to establish correlation between variance and nanoparticle parameter like size, mass and non-rigidity (stiffness) [1] [2]. In continuation, the present work investigates the significance of non-rigidity (stiffness) on variance in motion of nanoparticle. This work is important to conclude on whether soft nanoparticle moves more or less vis-à-vis a hard nanoparticle. We developed a model using correlation technique applied on Langevin equation for Brownian motion of nanoparticle and based on the simulation results, it was found that the motion is significantly governed by the stiffness of nanoparticles. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Development in the field of nanotechnology makes possible the production of nanorobots and its usage inside the human body for various biomedical applications. Introducing a nanorobot inside a human body faces various challenges. One of the major challenges is its propulsion mechanism. Since the flow regime is of low Reynolds number, normal propulsion systems would find itself impossible to produce net forward thrust in such media. A rigid helix is found to produce thrust force and is a perfect place to start with in low Reynolds number propulsion. In this paper, a set of helical flagella has been fabricated in macro domain and the effect of change of wavelength, wire diameter and helix diameter is investigated on the thrust force produced by rigid helical filament using Resistive Force Theory. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper reports structural, electrical, and gas sensing characteristics of n-ZnO/p-Si heterojunction diodes fabricated using RF sputtering technique. The microstructural and surface morphological properties have been studied using X-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy, respectively. The electrical properties of the fabricated diodes have been investigated using current-voltage (I - V) and capacitance-voltage (C - V) measurements. The estimated values for rectification ratio, ideality factor, and barrier height were found to be ∼100, 3.27, and 0.72eV, respectively, at room temperature. The values recorded for carrier concentration and barrier height using C - V measurement were 3.82× 1014 cm-3 and 0.79 eV, respectively. The value of series resistance using Chueng's function was found to be 1710 Ω. After detailed structural and electrical characterization, methanol sensing response (3-100 ppm) of n-ZnO/p-Si heterojunction diodes for the temperature range of 27 °C-150 °C have also been investigated. The optimum operating temperature for methanol sensing was found to be considerably low, i.e., 100 °C. The values of response magnitude, response time and recovery time at 100 °C were estimated as 82%, ∼4 and ∼7 s, respectively. The cross sensitivity study for the nearest interfering species, such as ethanol, 1-propanol, butanol, butanone, and benzene, has confirmed the high selectivity of n-ZnO/p-Si heterojunction diodes for methanol sensing. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, we present highly accurate and very efficient stack based surrogate models for standby (idle-time) statistical leakage estimation of CMOS circuits using sampling based methods. Our aim is to replace SPICE simulation with our proposed surrogate models, which can be used to evaluate samples generated by sampling methods in variation space. Our methodology initiates by first characterizing the leakage of basic transistor stacks and then provides estimate of the leakage of basic gates based on these stacks. Transistor stacks are extracted across various standard cells, which are used to estimate leakage of CMOS gates with different input vector combinations. We develop Support Vector Machine (SVM) regression surrogate models and characterize the transistor stacks of CMOS gates, while accounting the combined effect of process variations in transistor length (L), threshold voltage (Vth), oxide thickness (Tox), supply voltage (0.6V−1.2V), temperature (0°C−100°C) and width (28nm−200nm), all scalable at the same time. For gates containing parallel transistor stacks, we merge the parallel transistors having identical inputs, which in turn allows us to use precharacterized basic stacks for leakage calculation, thus avoiding generation of new models. Our experiments illustrate that we only require 30 and 26 stack models to predict the subthreshold and gate tunneling leakage of 20 different gates across 176 input combinations, instead of characterizing leakage model for each input vector separately. SVM regression models generated in our approach have the ability to predict the leakage with maximum average error of 2.7% in mean (μ) and maximum average error of 3.1% in standard deviation (σ), both for OAI22 gate. Our results establish that there is on an average 10× improvement in runtime while estimating the μ and σ of leakage of a gate within 10000 Monte Carlo simulation loop. Our approaches also result into a maximum of 221× runtime improvement for C6288 ISCAS'85 benchmark circuit. We further develop Sparse SVM models using Support Vector spectrum pruning method, which reduces the runtime of the regression models with negligible increase in the error. Runtime efficiency of 17× and 323× is achieved on standard cell library and C6288 benchmark circuit respectively using Sparse SVM models. Our models outperform previous models based on analytical equations and Artificial Neural Network in terms of accuracy. © 2017},

abstract={Cold expansion of fastener/rivet holes is a common way to generate beneficial compressive residual stress around the fastener hole. In this study, cold expansion process was simulated by finite-element method in order to determine the residual stress field around two cold expanded holes by varying the plate thickness and expansion ratio of the hole. The model was developed in ANSYS and assigned to aluminium alloy 7475-T61 material model. The results showed that the residual stress become more compressive as the plate thickness is increased up to t/d = 2.6 and decreased for further level of thickness. In addition, the residual stress at the edge of the hole become more compressive as the expansion ratio is increased up to 4.5% and decreased for further level of expansion. This study also found that the residual stresses near the entrance and the exit face of the plate are less compressive than the residual stresses on the mid-thickness of the plate. © 2017 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Quaternary and ternary alloy semiconductors offer an extra degree of flexibility in terms of bandgap tuning. Modifications in the wave functions and alterations in optical transitions in quaternary and ternary QW (quantum well) heterostructures due to external uniaxial strain provide valuable insights on the characteristics of the heterostructure. This paper reports the optical gain in strained InGaAsP/GaAsSb type-II QW heterostructure (well width = 20 Å) under external uniaxial strain at room temperature (300 K). The entire heterostructure is supposed to be grown on InP substrate pseudomorphically. Band structure, wave functions, energy dispersion and momentum matrix elements of the heterostructure have been computed. 6 × 6 diagonalised k→·p→ Hamiltonian matrix of the system is evaluated and Luttinger-Kohn model has been applied for the band structure and wavefunction calculations. TE mode optical gain spectrum in the QW-heterostructure under uniaxial strain along [110] is calculated. Optical gain of the heterostructure as a function of 2D carrier density and temperature variation is investigated. The variation of the peak optical gain as a function of As and Sb fractions in InGaAsP as a barrier and GaAsSb as a well respectively is exhibited. For a charge carrier injection of 5×1012/cm2, the TE optical gain is 3952 cm−1 at room temperature under no external uniaxial strain. Significant increase in TE mode optical gain is observed under high external uniaxial strain (1, 5 and 10 GPa) along [110] within IR (Infrared region) region. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={A theoretical study is presented here for the electro-osmosis modulated peristaltic three-layered capillary flow of viscous fluids with different viscosities in the layers. The layers considered here are the core layer, the intermediate layer and the peripheral layer. The analysis has been carried out under a number of physical restrictions viz. Debye-Hückel linearization (i.e. wall zeta potential ≤ 25 mV) is assumed sufficiently small, thin electric double layer limit (i.e. the peripheral layer is much thicker than the electric double layer thickness), low Reynolds number and large wavelength approximations. A non-dimensional analysis is used to linearize the boundary value problem. Fluid-fluid interfaces, peristaltic pumping characteristics, and trapping phenomenon are simulated. Present study also evaluates the responses of interface, pressure rise, time-averaged volume flow rate, maximum pressure rise, and the influence of Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity on the mechanical efficiency (with two different cases of the viscosity of fluids between the intermediate and the peripheral layer). Trapping phenomenon along with bolus dynamics evolution with thin EDL effects are analyzed. The findings of this study may ultimately be useful to control the microvascular flow during the fractionation of blood into plasma (in the peripheral layer), buffy coat (intermediate layer) and erythrocytes (core layer). This work may also contributes in electrophoresis, hematology, electrohydrodynamic therapy and, design and development of biomimetic electro-osmotic pumps. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Automobile emissions are the main source of greenhouse gases (GHG) accumulation in environment. As old engines (Euro III or earlier) produce more emissions and it will be difficult to entirely stop their usage especially in developing and underdeveloped nations, it is desired that appropriate emission reduction technologies are tested on such engines to analyze their feasibility and economical acceptability. While most such studies have been conducted on constant speed stationary engines and modern engines, this study tried to analyze the effectiveness of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system on a Euro-1, water-cooled, direct injection, variable speed, compression ignition (C.I.) engine in a laboratory setup in India. This was done by testing an electronic control unit (ECU)-controlled EGR valve running the engine on different speeds; with different torques, as also with varying EGR percentages. Then optimum value of EGR valve opening for each set of engine speed and torque was determined, that is, corresponding to minimum oxides of nitrogen (NOx). Optimum EGR valve position was programmatically fed, for each set of torque and engine speed (in RPM), into EGR ECU and then the engine was run at varying speeds and torques and the emissions were verified in the automated mode. It was found that using EGR, NOx emissions were substantially reduced (average 45% reduction), without significantly impacting the engine performance. However, smoke emission increased with EGR. In order to counter the adverse effects, additional emission reduction technologies should be used in tandem with EGR. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 36: 1685–1693, 2017. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog},

abstract={This paper presents and discusses AC-DC converters used for the Electrolysis of the non-ferrous metals and a case study of Aluminum Smelters at Hindalco to validate that thyristor converters are more energy efficient than diode converters. The most important factor in Aluminium production is the cost of energy used in the process of converting Aluminium oxide to Aluminium. This energy, which accounts for nearly 35% - 40% of the total cost of production of the metal, is primarily in the form of Direct Current (DC) power. DC Power is used in the process of electrolysis to convert Alumina (Aluminium Oxide) to Aluminium. With most of the production of electricity across the world is in the form of Alternating Current (AC) power, the process of conversion of this AC power to DC Power is critical. An efficient AC - DC converter becomes a critical component in the electrolytic reduction process of extracting non-ferrous metals in general and Aluminium in particular. The purpose of this research is to explore the reasons of mixed use of both the converter technologies, re-evaluate actual efficiency data on usage of both technologies and recommend the use of the more appropriate technology based on practical study. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Due to increased data movement and information exchange over internet and web, preserving data confidentiality and security has emerged as a prime concern for the end users. From bank transactions to document verification portals, from government official websites to social media, all these platforms share data remotely over web which contains certain confidential information and thus uses security mechanisms based on cryptographic algorithm to preserve the confidentiality of data preventing any information leakage or breach. RSA being the most popular public key cryptography based algorithm uses data encryption and decryption technique. It uses the mathematical concept of factorization of prime integers. The efficiency of the algorithm in terms of enhancing the security aspect to guess the factors of prime numbers increase when the numbers have high powers. Computing prime factors of these large numbers is compute intensive task where the serial programming makes RSA algorithm to slow down. The paper here presents an OpenMP based algorithmic modification to the code of RSA algorithm to improve the execution time using the parallel processing power of modern day multi-core architecture based machines. Experimental results under the lights of graphical representation shows a considerable speed up gained over the traditional implementation. Further the paper also compares the efficiency with other parallel implementations of RSA algorithm where the reported algorithm is found to perform almost equivalent to the GPGPU based implementation without the need of extra hardware in the form of graphics card and with reduced power consumption of the machine. The paper sums up with a conclusion that GPU based acceleration can be clubbed with proposed method to generate factors severely large prime numbers making it highly difficult to guess the factors.},

abstract={e authentication procedures are being utilized among the various Network & Communication Systems across the globe, which includes the healthcare networks, wireless sensor networks, Wi-Fi, etc. In the case of IoT networks, the small computational powered nodes are utilized as IoT sensors. e lower computational power creates the major hurdle in the implementation of security algorithms in the IoT node framework. A strong need of robust authentication mechanism with low resource requirement needs be developed to ensure the security of IoT networks. In this paper, the new authentication scheme is proposed over 6-column key table. e complex authentication keys are produced from the selective columns by using the combination of trigonometric functions. is model is created to protect data privacy against the Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) aacks over the IoT networks. e proposed model is designed for the enhancement in the level of security, while optimizing the elapsed time for key table generation (element-key table generation) and key preparation (complex key generation from element-keys). Various experiments have been conducted over the proposed model design and results are obtained in the form of the performance metrics of key table generation and key transmission and verication during the exchange of the keys. e proposed model is found ecient and secure for the purpose of authentication over the healthcare networks based upon the internet of things (IoT).

abstract={TiO2 nanoparticles are prepared by sol-gel method. As revealed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra the nanoparticles change their phase from anatase to rutile when the annealing temperature goes beyond 650°C. W-H plot for the powder samples annealed at 450°C and 750°C shows the presence of tensile strain in them which affects the particle size. The difference in particle sizes obtained from Debye-Scherer formula and W-H plot is seen to reduce for lesser strain value. The field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) images are observed to depict the agglomerated clusters of the particles whose average size favors the XRD results. The absorption is seen to show a red shift, as annealing temperature is raised. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Human Gait is a model of movement while locomotion and it is known as behavioural characteristic of human. Gait recognition is a behavioural biometric method that includes human identification from afar i.e. in absence of human and this is achieved by analysing the behaviour of their walking. Main aim to make GAIT recognition system is to impart a best method to recognize risks in places where high security is required like in banking, parking, airports etc. or to detect disease like Parkinson’s. In this paper we have shown the importance of gait recognition in order to detect whether a human GAIT is normal or abnormal, firstly the features of human gait is collected and then they are classified using neural network (Back propagation) and KNN classification technique. To test the proposed system the database contains 204 gaits and 16 different features were recognised, in which 3 datasets are crouch gait dataset and one normal gait dataset of 4 different humans is collected. We have obtained 100% of classification accuracy for a training data. Testing results shows 39.65% accuracy overall accuracy of system is 69.825%.},

abstract={The present investigation focuses the effect of process parameters on material removal rate (MRR) and surface roughness (Ra) in wire electric discharge machining of Inconel 625. Machining was done by using a normal zinc coated wire and cryogenic treated zinc coated wire. The experiments were performed by considering different process parameters viz. tool electrode, current intensity, pulse on time, pulse off time, wire feed and wire tension. The thickness of work material and dia. of wire are kept constant. Taguchi L18 (21 * 35) orthogonal array of experimental design is used to perform the experiments. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is employed to optimize the material removal rate and surface roughness. Based on analysis it is found that pulse on time, tool electrode and current intensity are the significant parameters that affect the material removal rate and surface roughness. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) are used to identify the microstructure of the machined work piece. © 2017 King Saud University},

abstract={Composite materials are being extensively used in aerospace and automotive industry. The demand for composite materials is increasing due to their superior properties such as high strength to weight ratio, good corrosion resistance and high stiffness. Post machining operations such as drilling, orthogonal cutting, turning are necessary for composite materials to meet the dimensional and functional requirements. Drilling is a major process in manufacturing of holes, required for assembling the components in industrial applications. Drilling of holes in composites leads to a drilling-induced damage called delamination. The researchers have tried to reduce the drilling-induced damage by minimizing the operating variables and tool design. However, the research on delamination analysis using finite element method (FEM) is limited. This paper provides a comprehensive literature review on machining of composites which mainly focuses on conventional methods like turning, milling, trimming and drilling and also on simulation methods including discrete element method and finite element method. A brief and in depth review for drilling of composites using finite element method is delivered, which provides a knowledge on damage of the composites caused during drilling and orthogonal cutting. Comparison of experimental and simulation results shows an overall vision on machining of CFRP using FEM tools. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

Spectral studies of these complexes suggest the presence of bi-dentate mode of the oximato moieties in the solution state. Soft transformations of aluminium(III) iso-propoxide and their oxime derivatives to pure alumina were carried out by the sol-gel technique. The powder XRD patterns of all the formed alumina suggest formation of cubic phase (γ-alumina) with average crystallites size of 7–30 nm. Optically transparent crack free alumina film was deposited on glass substrate using alumina sol, prepared by complex [Al(OiPr){ONC(CH3)2}], through dip coating method. The film sintered at 500 °C is amorphous in nature as indicated by XRD study. The alumina film is found to be ∼95% optically transparent in the visible region.

abstract={Mycosporine-like amino acids are the most common group of transparent ultraviolet radiation absorbing intracellular secondary metabolites. These molecules absorb light in the range of ultraviolet-A and -B with a maximum absorbance between 310 and 362 nm. Cyanobacteria might have faced the most deleterious ultraviolet radiation, which leads to an evolution of ultraviolet protecting mycosporine-like amino acids for efficient selection in the environment. In the last 30 years, scientists have investigated various cyanobacteria for novel mycosporine-like amino acids, applying different induction techniques. This review organizes all the cyanobacterial groups that produce various mycosporine-like amino acids. We found out that cyanobacteria belonging to orders Synechococcales, Chroococcales, Oscillatoriales, and Nostocales are frequently studied for the presence of mycosporine-like amino acids, while orders Gloeobacterales, Spirulinales, Pleurocapsales, and Chroococcidiopsidales are still need to be investigated. Nostoc and Anabaena strains are major studied genus for the mycosporine-like amino acids production. Hence, this review will give further insight to the readers about potential mycosporine-like amino acid producing cyanobacterial groups in future investigations. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

abstract={A numerical simulation for three dimensional steady flow of nanofluids passing through an exponential stretching sheet in presence of magnetohydrodymaics is presented. The surface of stretching sheet is considered as pervious. Buongiorno model associated with Brownian motion and thermophoretic diffusion is also employed. Well known similarity transformations are used to convert the governing equations into a set of ordinary differential equations. The transformed equations are then solved numerically using fourth order Runge-Kutta method. The effects of transverse magnetic field and permiability on dimensionless fluid velocity, fluid temperature, skin friction, Nusselt number and Sherwood number are examined. The numerical results accomplished in the present study are validated and felt to be in good agreement with the previously published results. The numerical computations reveal that that the Lorentz force due to presence of magnetic field impinges its resistance on fluid motion and enhances the thermal resistance. As a consequence, heat transfer rate from the sheet gets reduced in association with the porosity of the medium. © 2017},

abstract={This paper deals with a problem where the effect of variable magnetic field and chemical reaction on free convective flow of an electrically conducting incompressible water based nanofluid over an exponentially stretching sheet has been investigated. In the present study, Buongiorno model associated with Brownian motion and thermophoretic diffusion is employed to describe the heat transfer enhancement of nanofluids. Some suitable similarity transformations reduced the governing boundary layer non-linear partial differential equations into a set of ordinary non-linear differential equations. The transformed equations are then solved numerically using fourth order Runga-Kutta method along with Shooting technique. The major outcomes of the present study is that the magnetic field impedes the fluid motion while thermal as well as mass buoyancy forces accelerate it, the thermophoretic diffusion enhances dimensionless fluid temperature as well as concentration leading to thicker thermal and concentration boundary layers. On the other hand, concentration exponent, Brownian motion parameter and chemical reaction parameter exhibit reverse trend on temperature and concentration. In addition, the presence of magnetic field under the influence of thermal as well as mass buoyancies supports to reduce the rate of heat transfer as well as wall shear stress while the first order chemical reaction develops a thinner concentration boundary layer. © 2017 The Society of Powder Technology Japan},

abstract={This paper presents a novel approach in addressing a critical power system issue, i.e., automatic generation control (AGC) in a smart grid scenario. It proposes the design and implementation of an optimized fuzzy logic controller (FLC) for AGC of interconnected power network. There are three different sources of power generation considered in the two-area interconnected model of power system network. First area is equipped with a single reheat thermal unit and a superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) unit, while another area has a hydro-unit with SMES. A multi-stage optimization strategy for the optimal solution of FLC for tie-line and frequency oscillation suppression is proposed in this paper using an ant colony optimization technique. The optimization of FLC is carried out in four different stages. The first stage is the optimization of range of input and output variables; the second stage is the optimization of membership function; the third and fourth stages are the optimization for rule base and rule weight optimization, respectively. The performance of the proposed controller is also compared with another control approaches to stabilize Ptie-line and Δf oscillations; these are the Ziegler–Nichols-tuned proportional–integral–derivative (PID) controller and genetic algorithm optimized PID controller. A comprehensive analysis of the traditional techniques and proposed techniques is presented on the basis of major dynamic performance parameters, i.e., settling time and peak overshoot. © 2017, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Neuroinflammation, the condition associated with the hyperactivity of immune cells within the CNS (central nervous system), has recently been linked to a host range of neurodegenerative disorders. Targeting neuroinflammation could be of prime importance as recent research highlights the beneficial aspects associated with modulating the inflammatory mediators associated with the CNS. One of the main obstructions in neuroinflammatory treatments is the hindrance posed by the blood-brain barrier for the delivery of drugs. Hence, research has focused on novel modes of transport for drugs to cross the barrier through drug delivery and nanotechnology approaches. In this Review, we highlight the therapeutic advancement made in the field of neurodegenerative disorders by focusing on the effect neuroinflammation treatment has on these conditions. © 2017 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={In this paper various design of channel ADD Drop filter using photonic crystal ring resonator is investigated. In design I, ADF based on quasi-square PCRR with circular scatters is proposed and analysed for optimized performance. This device consists of rectangular waveguides and a quasi-square PCRR. A good wavelength selective filter with bandwidth about 10.20nm and centre wavelength of pass band 1.4201um is achieved. In the next design, photonic crystal quasi-square cavity based ADF is realised with elliptical scatters for different major and minor axis configurations thus having different ellipticity. It is observed that the output response of the filter is very sensitive to the dimensions of coupling rods and scatter rods. It is observed that when the radius of the scatter rods is increased, then the centre wavelength of the bands get shifted towards higher wavelength range. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Optical transition strength are observed to be affected in Al0.8Ga0.2As/GaAs0.8P0.2 type-I QW-heterostructure under external electric field. This paper reports optical gain realized in Al0.8Ga0.2As/GaAs0.8P0.2 type-I QW-heterostructure (varying well width 6nm-22nm). Band alignment, wavefunctions and optical gain of the nano-scale heterostructure under electromagnetic field perturbation is reported. The 6×6 diagonalised k. p Hamiltonian matrix is evaluated and Luttinger-Kohn model has been applied for the band structure calculations. Optical gain spectrum in the QW-heterostructure under external electric fields of (20, 40 and 60 kV/cm) is calculated. Optical gain (x and z polarizations) of the nano-scale heterostructure under well width and temperature variations is investigated. The optical gain spectrum of the heterostructure is seen to gradually rise with shrinking well width. Also the optical gain curve shows a decrease in gain with rising temperature levels. For a charge carrier injection of 4 × 1012/cm2 the optical gain is ∼220 under input x polarization [100] and ∼625 under z polarization [001] at 300K. The heterostructure is seen to be operating in the energy range of 1.5 to 1.75 eV (708 to 826 nm). Thus, a wide range wavelength tuning is achievable. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Biomimetic synthesis of metal nanoparticles (NPs) is safe and eco-friendly; therefore, find diverse applications. Considering this, the soil fungi Penicillium chrysogenum strain Fungal germplasm collection centre/BLS1 was isolated, characterized and explored to synthesize extracellular silver NPs (AgNPs) under optimised conditions. The synthesis of AgNPs was investigated using ultraviolet (UV)-visible spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis. Process optimisation exhibited AgNPs synthesis within 8 h using 2 mM AgNO3 at pH 11 and temperature 70°C. TEM analysis revealed polydispersed ellipsoidal shaped AgNPs with average particle size 96.8 nm as measured by DLS. AgNPs showed negative zeta potential that confers surface stability in solution. FTIR spectra confirmed the presence of protein bound to AgNPs. Antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus by the AgNPs (100 ppm) was demonstrated by counting colony forming unit, disc diffusion, and growth kinetics assay. Additionally radial assay revealed antifungal activity of AgNPs (100 ppm) against phytopathogenic fungi Sclerotinia sclerotiorum Microbial type culture collection 8785. Furthermore, AgNPs (100 ppm) did not show any cytotoxic effects on human Red blood cells. Therefore, this novel fungal strain can be utilised for biofabrication of AgNPs under optimised conditions and have shown strong antimicrobial property. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2017.},

abstract={Abstract: Heteroleptic complexes of the type [V(NPh)(OiPr)3-n{(ONC)(CH3)(C4H3O-2)}n] {where n = 1 (1), 2 (2) and 3 (3)} were synthesized by the reactions of [V(NPh)(OiPr)3] (A) with 2-acetylfuryl oxime in different molar ratios in anhydrous benzene. All these new derivatives have been characterized by elemental analyses, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (1H, 13C {1H}), 51V) and fast atom bombardment mass spectral studies. Spectral studies appear to be indicating mono-dentate and bi-dentate mode of attachment of the oximato moieties in the solution and solid state, respectively. Fast atom bombardment mass study of one of the representative derivative, [V(NPh){(ONC)(CH3)(C4H3O-2)}3] (3) suggests the monomeric nature of all these complexes. Thermogravimetric curve of [V(NPh){(ONC)(CH3)(C4H3O-2)}3] (3) shows large thermal events. Hydrolysis of [V(NPh)(OiPr)3] (A) and [V(NPh){(ONC)(CH3)(C4H3O-2)}3] (3) in moist propan-2-ol medium yielded vanadia, (a) and (b), respectively. However, hydrolysis of [V(NPh)(OiPr)3] (A) in n-hexane medium using calculated amount of water yielded hybrid material, (vn).The presence of (V = NPh) group in (vn) is confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance spectral studies as well as by the thermogravimetric study. The X-ray diffraction patterns of vanadia, (a) and (b) indicate formation of orthorhombic phase and the scanning electron microscope images of (a) and (b) show rod like morphology of the crystallites. Absorption spectra of vanadia, (a) and (b) indicate energy band gaps of 2.62 and 2.43 eV, respectively.

The geometric features of planar surfaces are decomposed into four components; namely straightness, flatness, perpendicularity, and parallelism. A non-linear minimum zone objective function is formulated mathematically for each planar surface geometric characteristic. Finally, the result of the proposed method is compared with previous work on the same problem and with other nature inspired algorithms. The results demonstrate that the proposed MPSO algorithm is more efficient and accurate in comparison to other algorithms and is well suited for effective and accurate evaluation of planar surface characteristics. © 2017 Vimal Kumar Pathak et al.},

abstract={This paper emphasizes the development of control strategy for inter-area oscillation suppression for a unified two-area hydro–thermal deregulated power system. A proportional derivative-type fuzzy logic controller with integral (PDFLC+I) controller was proposed for automatic generation control. Further comparisons among conventional integral controller, proportional integral derivative controller, and PDFLC+I are carried out, where the PDFLC+I controller is optimized by four different optimization techniques namely, algorithm, ant colony optimization, classical particle swarm optimization, and adaptive particle swarm optimization. In PDFLC+I controller optimization, scaling parameters of controllers are optimized. A comparative study shows that the proposed PDFLC+I controller has a better dynamic response following a step load change for the combination of PoolCo and bilateral contract-type transaction in deregulated environment. Proposed controller performance has also been examined for ±30% variation in system parameters. Non-linearity in the form of governor dead band is taken into account during simulation. © 2017, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={The present numerical simulations are carried out to investigate the effect of viscous dissipation, temperature dependent viscosity and heat source/sink on magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) unsteady Carreaue nanofluid over a cone filled with different alloy nanoparticles. We considered two different types of alloy nanoparticle namely nickel chromium iron alloy (Nimonic 80A) and titanium aluminum vanadium alloy (Ti%6Al%4V). The governing equations of the flow are solved using the Runge-Kutta and Newton's method. The present numerical results are compared with the previous study and found agreement with the uncertainty of ± 2.5%. Effects of various non-dimensional parameters such as Eckert number, power index parameter, volume fraction, heat source/sink parameter, viscous variation parameter and semi-vertical angle of the cone on the momentum and thermal boundary layer including the friction factor coefficients and local Nusselt number are presented and analyzed for two different alloy considered in the present study. It is found that the viscous variation parameter enables to enhance the heat transfer rate. The Ti%6Al%4V alloy has higher friction factor coefficient along the azimuthal direction of the flow while Nimonic 80A alloy boosts up the friction coefficient along the tangential direction. It is worth to mention that the heat transfer rate of Nimonic 80A alloy is higher than that of Ti%6Al%4V alloy. Hence, Nimonic 80A alloy signifies a better thermal performance than the Ti%6Al%4V alloy. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In a mobile wireless network, the unnecessary handoff is the main issue that effects the performance of the network. A handoff occurs when the Received Signal Strength (RSS) is less than the threshold RSS and the new RSS (from neighbors Access point) is more than the present RSS. Earlier the handoff decision algorithms consider RSS only which results in an increase in handoff counting or handoff rate but in a wireless communication system, the signal strength varies due to scattering, shadowing and reflection because of obstacles in the network region. This variation in RSS leads to unnecessary handoff. In this paper, a new method for handoff decision is proposed to reduce the unnecessary handoff. With simulation results or mathematical analysis 25% unnecessary handoff reduced. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Android operating system is widespread in today's smart-phone market due to its open source model, its easy functionality and huge number of Apps and App-Stores (the official and others). The coverage of some 90% of the market, it is also the place-holder for user's personal as well as sensitive information (IMEI, IMSI, etc.). There is a tendency of Apps user to trust on Android OS for securing his/her data but it has been proved that Android OS is more vulnerable to exploitation either for fun or for monetary purpose. Malware detection for Android OS has become an upcoming research problem of interest. Dynamic Taint Analysis is an efficient analysis in existing Android malware detection analysis. The aim of this paper is to work towards Dynamic Taint Analysis of Android malware using automatic tagging and with out modification in Android platform. In order to do this, this paper surveys exhaustively the available literature and works related to dynamic taint analysis. This paper proposes some novel ideas to improve the existing solution with more accuracy. There are two phases of our novel algorithm, the first phase is training phase for feature extraction and the second phase is the analysis phase for automatic tagging and tainting. We have developed a framework named AndroTaint, which is working on Dynamic Taint Analysis. AndroTaint follows a novel supervised and unsupervised Anomaly Detection technique with high precision, recall and harmonic mean. Our Dynamic Taint Analysis algorithm categorizes the App is risky, benign, malicious or aggressive as per their feature and behaviour. We have measured AndroTaint effectiveness on the basis of timeline for building dataset and 10-fold cross validation. AndroTaint covers 90% of malware and benign in analysis phase with less false positive and false negative. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={India's commercial building sector is witnessing robust growth. India continues to be a key growth market among global corporates and this is reflective in the steady growth in demand for prime office space. A recent trend that has been noted is the increase in demand for office spaces not just in major cities but also in smaller tier II and Tier III cities. Growth in the commercial building sector projects a rising trend of energy intensive mechanical systems in office buildings in India. The air conditioning market in India is growing at 25% annually. This is due to the ever increasing demand to maintain thermal comfort in tropical regions. Air conditioning is one of the most energy intensive technologies which are used in buildings. As a result India is witnessing significant spike in energy demand and further widening the demand supply gap. Challenge in India is to identify passive measures in building envelope design in office buildings to reduce the cooling loads and conserve energy. This paper investigates the overall heat gain through building envelope components and natural ventilation in warm and humid climate region through experimental and simulation methods towards improved thermal environmental performance. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Education and human development are in conjunction with the dynamism of the contemporary world. The education system has sensed the need to churn out young entrepreneurs in order to drive the economy forward at a significant pace, and today entrepreneurship development is headway with a host of technical subjects. However, it is imperative to recognise that the entrepreneur is first and foremost, a brand on his/her own accord, even before he/she projects his/her company. One's image is crucial in the advancement of his/her venture and life at large. In today's competitive world, one has to stand out amidst the multitudes, personally as well as professionally. Technical know-how is not always enough as a professional. One needs the winning edge! Image Management concretely leverages one's position on the ladder of growth, success and recognition as well as aspirations in the vitality of the contemporary world. Thus emerges a weighty need for the incorporation of the study of Image Management in the education system for every budding entrepreneur. Ironically, the education system has yet to recognise and explore this area. The paper recognises this need and attempts to conceptually bridge the gap by bringing forth the relevance, purpose and utility of Image Management. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.

abstract={Background and objectives This paper aims to investigate the unsteady flow of two types of nanofluids i.e Copper water nanofluids and Silver water nanofluids) through finite length non-uniform channel driven by peristaltic sinusoidal wave propagations. Methods The governing equations are reduced in linear form using dimensional analysis and considering the low Reynolds number and large wavelength approximations. The time dependent temperature field, axial velocity, transverse velocity and pressure difference are obtained analytically in closed form solution. Trapping phenomenon is also discussed with the help of contour plots of stream function. A comparative study of pure water (Newtonian fluid), Copper water nanofluids and Silver water nanofluids under the influence of relevant physical parameters is made in graphical form and also discussed. The effects of absorption parameter and Grashof number on velocity profiles, temperature profiles and pressure distribution along the length of channel are examined. Results conclusions The computational results reveal that the velocity profile is maximum for Silver water nanofluids however, it is least for Copper water nanofluids. It is also concluded the temperature profile is more for pure water in comparison to Silver water and Copper water nanofluids. This model is applicable to design, micro-peristaltic pumps which help in Nanoparticle-based targeted drug delivery and to transport the sensitive or corrosive fluids, sanitary fluids, slurries and noxious fluids in nuclear industry. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

The density functional theory (DFT) in the framework of full potential linearized augmented plane wave (FP-LAPW) scheme has been used for the present calculations with local density approximation (LDA) and generalized gradient approximation (GGA). Electronic properties deal with energy bands and density of states (DOSs), while optical properties describe refractive index and absorption coefficient. The energy bands are interpreted in terms of DOSs. The computed value of band gap is in agreement with that reported in the literature. Our results predict AgScO2 as indirect band-gap semiconductor. Our calculated value of the refractive index in zero frequency limits is 2.42.

The equations governing the transport phenomena are non-dimensionalized and the resulting boundary value problem is solved analytically in the steady state subject to physically appropriate boundary conditions. Numerical computations are conducted to quantify the effects of relevant hemodynamic, thermophysical and nanoscale parameters emerging in the model on velocity and temperature profiles, wall shear stress, impedance resistance and also streamline distributions.

abstract={The poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) polymer blend films were prepared by solution casting method with varying PolyChloroTriFluoroEthylene (PCTFE) concentrations (1–5 wt %). The crystallinity, bonding behavior and disorder in the films were investigated with X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), UV–visible and ellipsometry techniques, while surface morphology was studied using Atomic force microscopy (AFM). The nanocrystalline nature of PMMA is seen to be preserved in the blends although there are clear indications of bond modifications. The addition of PCTFE results in the improvement of overall crystallinity of the films via the interaction among PMMA and degraded PCTFE molecules when the films are casted from diluted solutions. In agreement, corresponding disorder in terms of Urbach energy shows a decreasing trend upon inclusion of more and more PCTFE molecules. Micro-Raman spectra are dominated by fluorescence background, which is proposed as arising from degraded PCTFE. Supporting this, FTIR spectra also shows modifications in bonding as a function of PCTFE percentage, but this bond modification is not enough to produce refractive index variation in the sample, which is dominated by the host PMMA contribution for all the PCTFE concentrations. The study suggests the useful range of PCTFE concentration in which PMMA host properties can be modified for optimizing optical and structural properties without much degradation of PCTFE. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This paper mainly focuses on the influence of transverse magnetic field as well as thermal radiation on three-dimensional free convective flow of nanofluid over a linear stretching sheet. One remarkable aspect of this study is that a new micro-convection model namely Patel model has been introduced in view of enhancement of thermal conductivity and hence more heat transfer capability of nanofluid. The non-linear partial differential equations have been converted into strong non-linear ordinary differential equations by employing suitable transformations and these transformed equations are solved by Runga-Kutta method of fourth order along with Shooting technique as well as Secant method for better approximation. From this study, it is found that the presence of magnetic field slows down the fluid motion while it enhances the fluid temperature leading to a reduction in heat transfer rate from the surface. It is also found that enhancing thermal radiation parameter causes a reduction in heat transfer rate. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={A novel algorithm for the colour image encryption is proposed in this paper. Proposed algorithm is based on image scrambling and Linear canonical Transform. The image scrambling accomplished using the chaotic function with iterations along the length of the image to be scrambled. The Linear canonical transform (LCT) is used to encrypt all the three components of colour image i.e. Red, Green and Blue at the same time. Application of the LCT over these components makes to not affect each other. So the connections between Red, Green and Blue components is condensed in the encrypted components. The security of the colour image is increased using the proposed algorithm. Simulation results represents that the proposed algorithm is best suited for the colour image encryption as well it provide safety to various attacks. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={The dynamic circuits are supposed to offer superior speed and low power dissipation over static CMOS circuits. The domino logic circuits are used for high system performance but suffer from the precharge pulse degradation. This article provides different design topologies on the domino circuits to overcome the charge sharing and charge leakage with reference to the power dissipation and delay. The precharge keeper circuit has been proposed such that the keeper transistors also work as the precharge transistors to realize multiple output function. The performance improvement of the circuit’s analysis have been done for adders and logic gates using HSPICE tool. The proposed keeper techniques reveal lower power dissipation and lesser delay over the standard keeper circuit with less transistor count for different process variation. © 2017, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

The effects of porosity on an unsteady boundary layer flow of water-based magnetic nanofluids over a uniformly heated stationary disk are discussed numerically. Fluid viscosity is considered as a function of both depth and temperature. The Runge-Kutta fourth-order method along with the shooting technique is employed for solving a set of coupled ordinary differential equations. The computed results reveal that heat transfer is appreciably enhanced with more porosity and rotation of the fluid. Also, varying the fluids Prandtl number from 20 to 80, the rate of heat transfer increases by 93.35% and faster cooling of the system occurs. © 2017, Società Italiana di Fisica and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.},

abstract={Biomimetic propulsion mechanisms are increasingly being explored in engineering sciences. Peristalsis is one of the most efficient of these mechanisms and offers considerable promise in microscale fluidics. Electrokinetic peristalsis has recently also stimulated significant attention. Electrical and magnetic fields also offer an excellent mode for regulating flows. Motivated by novel applications in electro-conductive microchannel transport systems, the current article investigates analytically the electromagnetic pumping of non-Newtonian aqueous electrolytes via peristaltic waves in a two-dimensional microchannel with different peristaltic waves propagating at the upper and lower channel wall (complex wavy scenario). The Stokes couple stress model is deployed to capture micro-structural characteristics of real working fluids. The unsteady two-dimensional conservation equations for mass and momentum conservation, electro-kinetic and magnetic body forces, are formulated in two dimensional Cartesian co-ordinates. The transport equations are transformed from the wave frame to the laboratory frame and the electrical field terms rendered into electrical potential terms via the Poisson-Boltzmann equation, Debye length approximation and ionic Nernst Planck equation. The dimensionless emerging linearized electro-magnetic boundary value problem is solved using integral methods. The influence of Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity (characteristic electro-osmotic velocity), couple stress length parameter (measure of the polarity of the fluid), Hartmann magnetic number, and electro-osmotic parameter on axial velocity, volumetric flow rate, time-averaged flow rate and streamline distribution are visualized and interpreted at length. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of fiber orientation and ply stacking sequence of basalt-carbon hybrid composite laminates on the critical buckling strength, experimentally and by using nonlinear finite element analysis. The composite laminated plates are simply supported and subjected to axial compression load. Nonlinear FEA results using ANSYS have good agreement with the experimental results. FEA results showed that the outer layers have the most significant influence on the buckling strength of the composite laminated material. Furthermore, placing carbon fiber reinforced layers in the outer surface of the basalt-carbon/epoxy hybrid laminates results in significant increase in the critical buckling load compared to placing basalt fiber reinforced layers in the outer surface. It is also concluded that [0 2 C/0B/+45B] S laminate is the best combination of the hybrid stacking sequences as far as buckling strength is concerned. © 2017, National Institute of Science Communication and Information Resources (NISCAIR).

abstract={Motivated by novel developments in surface-modified, nanoscale, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) biomedical devices, we study theoretically the ciliary induced transport by metachronal wave propagation in hydromagnetic flow of copper-water nanofluids through a parallel plate channel. Under the physiological constraints, creeping flow is taken into consideration i.e. inertial forces are small compared with viscous forces. The metachronal wavelength is also considered as very large for cilia induced MHD flow. Magnetic Reynolds number is sufficiently large to invoke magnetic induction effects. The physical problem is linearized and exact solutions are developed for the resulting boundary value problem. Closed-form expressions are presented for the stream function, pressure rise, induced magnetic field function and temperature. Mathematica symbolic software is used to compute and illustrate numerical results. The influence of physical parameters on velocity profile, pressure gradient and trapping of bolus are discussed with the aid of graphs.

abstract={This paper presents a frequency reconfigurable monopole antenna with switchable band characteristics from Ultra-wideband (UWB) radiator to band-notched UWB radiator to dual-band radiator by the mean of three p-i-n diode switches. Three p-i-n diodes are employed in the slots on the circular ring and rectangular patch to make the antenna reconfigurable in three radiating modes: UWB radiator (with all diodes in the ON-state), 5.3 GHz band-notched UWB radiator (with D1 and D3 in the ON-state, and D2 in the OFF-state) and dual-band radiator (with D1 in the OFF-state and D2, D3 in the ON-state) are reported. In all modes of the diodes, good agreements between simulated and measured results are observed. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Load Balancing is a mechanism of efficient utilization of computing resources (i.e. CPU, Memory and Network). Cloud computing is the best option to reduce CAPEX and OPEX of the organizations. High Quality of Service (QoS) and reduction the Service Level Agreement (SLA) violation depend on efficient management of Load Imbalance problem. Cloud Service efficiency depends on proper management of physical and logical resources. Researchers did lots of work on the effective load management system. Researchers used many approaches (i.e. Ant colony, Honey Bee, Genetic, Static, and Dynamic) but still need improvement. Virtual Machines (VMs) migration system plays the vital role in load management. Our focus in this research is maximizing the utilization of VMs CPU capacity. Proposed research approach is based on Dynamic Weighted Live Migration (DWLM) to manage load imbalance problem. The proposed mechanism results outcomes compared with Migration time, Scalability, Throughput and Availability factor from Equally Spread Current Execution load balancing algorithm (ESCEL) and Push Pull algorithm. This paper also focuses on others load balancing strategies and future research scope in Load management mechanism. © 2016 IEEE.},

This study revealed that bioactive compounds present in the extract function as stabilizing and capping agent for AgNPs. Scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope studies confirm the structure and surface morphology of the AgNPs. The size of synthesized AgNPs was in the range of 30–50 nm having spherical morphology. The crystalline nature of NPs was defined by the X-ray diffraction pattern. The AgNPs were found to be toxic against pathogenic bacteria such as Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), and Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213) and against plant pathogenic fungi Fusarium oxysporum (MTCC 8608) and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (MTCC 8785). The use of AgNPs as antibacterial and antifungal agent is advantageous over other methods for control of pathogenic microorganisms, and it can be of great importance in developing novel drugs for curing many lethal diseases. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Tinospora cordifolia is a prioritized medicinal plant and having an immense medicinal importance especially in Indian medicinal system. But this plant needs a regeneration protocol for its rapid propagation. An efficient regeneration protocol was developed for T. cordifolia using nodal explants. High frequency of multiple shoot formation was induced when the nodal segments were cultured on MS medium supplemented with BAP (1.0 mg L−1) and 2-iP (0.5 mg L−1). The highest mean number of shoots per nodal explant (7.9 ± 0.45) with highest shoot length (9.3 ± 0.48 cm) and 86% response were achieved on this media and hormonal concentration. The optimum rooting was obtained on ½ strength of MS medium augmented with IBA (0.5 mg L−1) with 8.3 ± 0.46 cm root length and 89% response. Micropropagated plantlets were found to be identical with the mother plant when clonal fidelity of these plantlets were analyzed with inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) marker. The berberine content was analyzed through LCMS QToF and the highest amount was found in in vitro callus (19.8 µg/gm) followed by stem (9.3 µg/gm) and leaves of field-grown plants (8.4 µg/gm). Further, presence of berberine was confirmed by ESI–MS spectra with protonated molecular ions ([M + H]+) at m/z 336. Furthermore, MS–MS fragmentation pattern confirmed for the presence of berberine in both the samples. Both the spectra (standard and samples) showed common peaks for berberine in the form of protonated molecular ions ([M + H]+) at m/z 320, m/z 304, m/z 292, m/z 278 in MS/MS mode. The study revealed that developed protocol is potent for rapid mass propagation of this plant species with high accumulation of important secondary metabolite berberine. © 2017, The Author(s).},

abstract={A mathematical model is developed to analyze electro-kinetic effects on unsteady peristaltic transport of blood in cylindrical vessels of finite length. The Newtonian viscous model is adopted. The analysis is restricted under Debye-Hückel linearization (i.e., wall zeta potential ≤ 25mV) is sufficiently small). The transformed, nondimensional conservation equations are derived via lubrication theory and long wavelength and the resulting linearized boundary value problem is solved exactly. The case of a thin electric double layer (i.e., where only slip electro-osmotic velocity considered) is retrieved as a particular case of the present model. The response in pumping characteristics (axial velocity, pressure gradient or difference, volumetric flow rate, local wall shear stress) to the influence of electro-osmotic effect (inverse Debye length) and Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity is elaborated in detail. Visualization of trapping phenomenon is also included and the bolus dynamics evolution with electro-kinetic effects examined. A comparative study of train wave propagation and single wave propagation is presented under the effects of thickness of EDL and external electric field. The study is relevant to electrophoresis in haemotology, electrohydrodynamic therapy and biomimetic electro-osmotic pumps. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={This paper presents the results of an experimental investigation of the strength, permeability, abrasion, carbonation, and shrinkage characteristics of concrete containing various percentages of copper tailing as partial replacement of natural fine aggregates. M 25 Grade concrete was designed as per specific national specifications. Copper tailing was used to replace natural sand in the range of 0-80%. It was observed that the copper-tailing concrete with up to 80% substitution exhibited a comparable compressive and flexural strength when compared to the control specimens. From the abrasion test, it was noted that the specimens could be implemented in general-purpose and heavy-duty floor tiles. The shrinkage strains, water permeability, and carbonation of copper-tailing concrete were observed to be increasing with increasing replacement amounts of copper tailing. The concrete containing copper tailing replacing up to 70% of natural fine aggregates could be recommended for all applications, and substitution levels beyond 70% could be recommended for nonstructural applications, pavements, etc. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract={A low voltage self-biased high swing cascode current mirror (SHCCM) with improved bandwidth has been proposed. The recently reported SHCCM architecture use the bulk-driven quasi-floating gate (BDQFG) MOS transistors to enhance the effective transconductance which improves the current mirror input resistance and bandwidth range over the same architecture realized using bulk-driven MOS transistors. To further improve the bandwidth the proposed BDQFG based SHCCM uses two resistances which makes the current mirror frequency response free from input capacitors and also reduces the parasitic capacitance effect which results in increased bandwidth with an advantage of having no degradation in other performance parameters of current mirror. The proposed current mirror operates well for input current range from 0 to 200 μA with good linearity and shows the bandwidth of 298 MHz (i.e., 1.6 times over prior reported BDQFG based SHCCM). The observed input and output resistance is 306 Ω and 165 kΩ, respectively. Further, the THD analysis is carried to prove the robustness of proposed current mirror. The complete analysis is performed on UMC 0.18 μm technology using HSpice.},

abstract={A mathematical model is developed for electro-osmotic peristaltic pumping of a non-Newtonian liquid in a deformable micro-channel. Stokes' couple stress fluid model is employed to represent realistic working liquids. The Poisson-Boltzmann equation for electric potential distribution is implemented owing to the presence of an electrical double layer (EDL) in the micro-channel. Using long wavelength, lubrication theory and Debye-Huckel approximations, the linearized transformed dimensionless boundary value problem is solved analytically. The influence of electro-osmotic parameter (inversely proportional to Debye length), maximum electro-osmotic velocity (a function of external applied electrical field) and couple stress parameter on axial velocity, volumetric flow rate, pressure gradient, local wall shear stress and stream function distributions is evaluated in detail with the aid of graphs. The Newtonian fluid case is retrieved as a special case with vanishing couple stress effects. With increasing the couple stress parameter there is a significant increase in the axial pressure gradient whereas the core axial velocity is reduced. An increase in the electro-osmotic parameter both induces flow acceleration in the core region (around the channel centreline) and it also enhances the axial pressure gradient substantially. The study is relevant in the simulation of novel smart bio-inspired space pumps, chromatography and medical micro-scale devices. © 2017, Società Italiana di Fisica and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={The Inhomogeneous plasma with positive ions and electrons in which collisions are taking place is considered. To include the modification due to the magnetized plasma, a static magnetic field B0 is considered to be applied in the z-direction and the wave propagation is taken at an angle θ with it in the (X, Z) plane. The ions are assumed to be cold and singly charged. Fluid equations which take into account the recombination effects are formulated for ions and the electrons. Potential is found from Poisson's equation using normal mode analysis (NMA) along with linear approximation, neglecting higher order perturbed terms. From Potential equation, dispersion relation is generated which is solved numerically for obtaining the value of ω using typical plasma parameters. The behavior of growth rate with magnetic field, propagation angle, recombination constant along with different plasma oscillation wavelength to Debye length ratio (λ / λDe) has been studied. Two types of instabilities has been observed. Both the instabilities showing the same behavior with respect to recombination constant, magnetic field and (λ / λDe) plasma oscillation wavelength to Debye wavelength ratio. But they behave opposite to each other with respect to propagation angle (angle between the magnetic field and the propagation vector). © 2017 Author(s).},

abstract={Isotropic Compton profiles of transition metal based ceramics TaB and VB have been measured using 137Cs (661.65 keV) γ-ray Compton spectrometer. The experimental momentum densities are compared with those deduced using linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) with Hartree-Fock (HF), density functional theory (DFT) with Wu-Cohen generalized gradient approximation (WCGGA) and also the hybridization of HF and DFT (namely B3PW and PBE0) schemes. It is found that LCAO-DFT-WCGGA scheme based profiles give an overall better agreement with the experimental data, for both the borides. In addition, we have computed the Mulliken's population (MP) charge transfer data, energy bands, density of states and Fermi surface topology of both the borides using full potential-linearized augmented plane wave (FP-LAPW) and LCAO methods with DFT-WCGGA scheme. Cross-overs of Fermi level by the energy bands corresponding to B-2p and valence d-states of transition metals lead to metallic character in both the compounds. Equal-valence-electron-density profiles and MP analysis suggest more ionic character of VB than that of TaB. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

It was concluded that though not much harm has happened to the underground water in any of these locations but the same was not fit for drinking either. Out of the 3 locations, Bagru had the worst situation followed by Sanganer and Muhana. The unit successfully eliminated arsenic and lead fully and achieved about 75% reduction in fluoride, chloride and turbidity.

abstract={Passive cooling is a building design approach that focuses on heat gain control and heat dissipation in a building in order to improve the indoor thermal comfort with low or nil energy consumption. Appropriate air temperature distribution in a room is necessary for thermal comfort. By using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) it is possible to compare optional ways of air supply for maintaining thermal comfort in a conditioned zone equipped with passive cooling like EATHE. Using these simulations, designer can choose the best method of air supply in the room diminishing the risk of an incorrect solution. This paper compares three cases in which integration of active (AC) and passive (EATHE) cooling was analysed with the help of CFD tool. The uniform heat flux from the surface was set to 55 W/m2, AC air velocity of 3 m/s and supply temperature kept constant at 291 K. k-E model was considered for the turbulence model. Results was analysed and it was concluded that minimum time taken and maximum temperature drop was achieved with the installation of both the equipment on the same side of the room. © 2017 The Authors.},

abstract={With rising population, development, and environmental pollution, availability of potable water is shrinking fast. Thus, it is required to focus on the distillation of available water. Solar Still is one of the promising technologies available to purify water because of its low cost, energy, and skill requirement. However, the efficiency of present technology is low, so it is required to advance the designs of existing solar stills. In this study, a multi-phase three-dimensional CFD model of a simple solar still developed for simulation with using ANSYS FLUENT. The simulation has been done for transient state to validate the results with experimental data for climate conditions of Jaipur (26°13'N, 75°49'E). Within the scope of this study, simulation results were found to be in good agreement with the experimental data. It is also examined that thermal efficiency of the Solar Still is higher from 16:00 to 17:00 hrs. Parametric analyses has been done to enhance the productivity of Solar Still. Different materials were used in the basin to increase the heat capacity, absorption capacity and the evaporation rate. The impact of varying the depth of the basin water was also studied. It has been found that the Solar Still have more productivity for low water depth. © 2017 The Authors.},

abstract={The Variable Refrigerant Flow (VRF) technology has emerged as promising alternative to conventional systems, especially for small residential and commercial buildings which are largely untouched in regard to the energy efficiency of space conditioning systems despite the huge energy saving potential. This study aims to find out whether VRF split system provides an energy efficient and viable retrofit option for this sector. This paper compares the performance of an inverter based VRF Unitary AC with Constant Volume Unitary AC using the field performance testing. Both systems were installed in two geometrically and thermally identical rooms, with 14.5 m2 floor area each. Observations were made in the months of January to May, the systems were operated from 10 AM to 6 PM, auxiliary heating was also provided to vary the zone internal load conditions; the auxiliary heat load provided by the electrical heaters was 2 kW and 4 kW. The results were analyzed and it was found that the VRF technology is energy saving only when it works on part load conditions; minimum (negative) savings were observed when the outdoor temperature was equal to the rated outdoor DBT i.e. when the system was operating at full load conditions while maximum savings i.e. 40% were observed when the outdoor DBT is nearly equal to the indoor set point temperature. © 2017 The Authors.},

abstract={The present investigation focusses on a mathematical study of creeping viscous flow induced by metachronal wave propagation in a horizontal ciliated tube containing porous media. Creeping flow limitations are imposed, i.e. inertial forces are small compared to viscous forces and therefore a very low Reynolds number (Re 1) is taken into account. The wavelength of metachronal wave is also considered to be very large for cilia movement. The physical problem is linearized and exact solutions are developed for the differential equation problem. Mathematica software is used to compute and illustrate numerical results. The influence of slip parameter and Darcy number on velocity profile, pressure gradient and trapping of bolus are discussed with the aid of graphs. It is found that with increasing magnitude of the slip parameter, the trapped bolus inside the streamlines increases in size. The study is relevant to biological propulsion of medical micromachines in drug delivery.},

abstract={The transport of single-wall carbon nanotube (CNT) nanofluids with temperature-dependent variable viscosity is analyzed by peristaltically driven flow. The main flow problem has been modeled using cylindrical coordinates and flow equations are simplified to ordinary differential equations using long wavelength and low Reynolds' number approximation. Analytical solutions have been obtained for axial velocity, pressure gradient and temperature. Results acquired are discussed graphically for better understanding. It is observed that with an increment in the Grashof number the velocity of the governing fluids starts to decrease significantly and the pressure gradient is higher for pure water as compared to single-walled carbon nanotubes due to low density. As the specific heat is very high for pure water as compared to the multi-wall carbon nanotubes, it raises temperature of the muscles, in the case of pure water, as compared to the multi-walled carbon nanotubes. Furthermore, it is noticed that the trapped bolus starts decreasing in size as the buoyancy forces are dominant as compared to viscous forces. This model may be applicable in biomedical engineering and nanotechnology to design the biomedical devices. © 2017, Società Italiana di Fisica and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={In the present work, we report exchange bias tuning by varying thin film deposition parameters such as synthesis method and underlying layer patterning. The patterned substrates for this study were prepared by self-assembly of polystyrene (PS) latex spheres (~530 nm) on Si (100) substrate. The desired magnetic nanocaps composed of CoO/Co bilayer film on these patterned substrates were prepared by molecular beam epitaxy technique under ultra-high vacuum conditions. For this, a Co layer of ~10 nm thickness was deposited on the substrates and then oxidized in-situ to form CoO/Co/PS in-situ oxidized film or ex-situ in ambiance which also gives CoO/Co/PS naturally oxidized film. Simultaneously, reference thin films of Co (~10 nm) were also prepared on plane Si substrate and similar oxidation treatments were performed on them respectively. The magnetic properties studied using SQUID technique revealed higher exchange bias (~1736 Oe) in the in-situ oxidized Co/PS film as compared to that in naturally oxidized Co/PS film (~1544 Oe) and also compared to the reference film. The observed variations in the magnetic properties are explained in terms of surface patterning induced structural changes of the deposited films and different oxidation methods. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={A mathematical model to simulate oxygen delivery through a capillary to tissues under the influence of an external force field is presented. The multi-term general fractional diffusion equation containing force terms and a time dependent absorbent term is taken into account. Fractional calculus is applied to describe the phenomenon of sub-diffusion of oxygen in both transverse and longitudinal directions. A new computational algorithm, i.e., the new iterative method (NIM) is employed to solve the spatio-temporal fractional partial differential equation subject to appropriate physical boundary conditions. Validation of NIM solutions is achieved with a modified adomian decomposition method (MADM). A parametric study is conducted for three loading scenarios on the capillary-radial force alone, axial force alone and the combined case of both forces. The results demonstrate that the force terms markedly influence the oxygen diffusion process. For example, the radial force exerts a more profound effect than axial force on sub-diffusion of oxygen indicating that careful manipulation of these forces on capillary-tissues may assist in the effective reduction of hypoxia or other oxygen depletion phenomena. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={The integration of Distributed Generation (DG) units in the existing power system has made the reliableoperation of the system more complex. This has necessitated a comprehensive approach in planning the expansion ofthe system with the incorporation of DG units for effective and reliable operation of the system. In this study, a robustHybrid Islanding Detection Technique (HIDT) has been proposed for identifying the islanding event early and accuratelyin the distribution networks with DGs installed by a two-step Genetic Algorithm (GA) process. As the reliability ofpower supply to the customer is of utmost importance, a priority-based load shedding scheme is proposed. Theproposed load shedding scheme sheds only the vulnerable loads in the island for regaining the frequency and voltagestabilities. By the proposed methods, a comprehensive solution for system planning and emergency control actionscan be obtained for effective operation of the system with DG units. The proposed methods are investigated onstandard IEEE 33 and 69 bus distribution systems under different loading conditions. The results obtained show thatthe proposed methods are able to identify the islanding event more effectively and also regain the stability in theisland with less amount of load shedding. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2016.},

abstract={This paper presents a hybrid fuzzy sliding mode controller for control of speed in a BLDC motor drive. For the most part, Brushless DC motors have been utilized as a part of different modern and local applications due to its favorable characteristics such as straightforward structure, extensive torque, long utilize time, great speed regulation. However the BLDC motor frameworks have questionable and nonlinear attributes which corrupt execution of controllers. Sliding mode controllers (SMC) are very useful in controlling the non-linearities in the system. But due to the effect of chattering in SMC based drives, the use of controller is limited. Henceforth a novel hybrid fuzzy sliding mode controller is exhibited in this paper for effectively reducing the chattering effect. Simulation study is carried out in MATLAB so as to validate the performance of the said scheme. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Effort estimation plays a pivotal role for planning the development of any software applications. When there is a need of developing web-based applications, the need of proper estimation of its effort is considered to be very essential. Web-based software projects are different than conventional projects, and hence the task of estimation is a complex one. It is observed that the literature does not provide a guidance to the analysts to use a particular model for effort estimation of this type of applications. A number of models like IFPUG Function Point Model, NESMA, MARK-II, etc. are being considered for effort estimation of web-based applications. The efficiency of these models can be improved by employing certain intelligent techniques on them. This study considers the application of various machine learning techniques such as K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Constrained Topological Mapping (CTM), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) and Classification and Regression Tree (CART) for effort estimation of web-based applications using IFPUG Function Point approach. The ISBSG dataset, Release 12 has been considered in this study for obtaining the IFPUG Function Point data. The effectiveness of these machine learning techniques-based effort estimation models is assessed with the help of certain metrics, in order to evaluate performance of desired web-based applications. © 2017 ACM.},

Our investigations show that energy bands and DOS computed using mBJ potential are in better agreement with the available experimental data. Optical properties such as, dielectric tensor components, absorption spectra, reflectivity, refractivity, dielectric loss, are investigated using mBJ potential. Imaginary peaks of di-electric tensor ε2(ω), are interpreted by means of inter-band transitions from valence to conduction band. High intensity absorption curves from 3 to 5 eV, energy band gap depicted for ZnGa2Te4 (1.61 eV) and CdGa2Te4 (1.78 eV) materials indicates their applicability for solar photovoltaic and other optoelectronic applications. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This paper presents an analytical study of magnetohydrodynamics and convective heat transfer of nanofluids synthesized by three different shaped (brick, platelet and cylinder) silver (Ag) nanoparticles in water. A two-phase nanoscale formulation is adopted which is more appropriate for biophysical systems. The flow is induced by metachronal beating of cilia and the flow geometry is considered as a cylindrical tube. The analysis is carried out under the low Reynolds number and long wavelength approximations and the fluid and cilia dynamics is of the creeping type. A Lorentzian magnetic body force model is employed and magnetic induction effects are neglected. Solutions to the transformed boundary value problem are obtained via numerical integration. The influence of cilia length parameter, Hartmann (magnetic) number, heat absorption parameter, Grashof number (free convection), solid nanoparticle volume fraction, and cilia eccentricity parameter on the flow and heat transfer characteristics (including effective thermal conductivity of the nanofluid) are examined in detail. Furthermore a comparative study for different nanoparticle geometries (i.e. bricks, platelets and cylinders) is conducted. The computations show that pressure increases with enhancing the heat absorption, buoyancy force (i.e. Grashof number) and nanoparticle fraction however it reduces with increasing the magnetic field. The computations also reveal that pressure enhancement is a maximum for the platelet nano-particle case compared with the brick and cylinder nanoparticle cases. Furthermore the quantity of trapped streamlines for cylinder type nanoparticles exceeds substantially that computed for brick and platelet nanoparticles, whereas the bolus magnitude (trapped zone) for brick nanoparticles is demonstrably greater than that obtained for cylinder and platelet nanoparticles. The present model is applicable in biological and biomimetic transport phenomena exploiting magnetic nanofluids and ciliated inner tube surfaces. © 2016 The Society of Powder Technology Japan},

abstract={In this communication, the design and performance of micro strip line feed U-shaped printed monopole antenna for Bluetooth/WI-MAX/WLAN communications systems is reported. The proposed monopole antenna has an eight shaped slot on the patch and an eight shaped ring structure in the ground with a metallic reflector beneath the ground plane. The CST Microwave Studio 2014 used for the simulation analysis of antennas while measurements performed by applying Vector Network Analyzer (R&SZVA 40). This radiating structure provides triple broad impedance bandwidths, i.e. 265MHz (in 2.280 GHz to 2.545 GHz frequency range), 116 MHz (in 2.660 GHz to 2.776 GHz frequency range) & 2.12 GHz (in 3.83 GHz to 5.956 GHz frequency range), wider 3dB axial ratio bandwidth 1.33 GHz (in 4.69GHz to 6.02GHz range), nearly flat gain (with maximum gain close to 5.56 (dBi) and good radiation patterns in the desired frequency range. This antenna may be a useful structure for 2.45GHz Bluetooth communication band as well as in WLAN & WI-MAX communications bands. © 2017, Advanced Electromagnetics. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={A improved design of channel drop filter is proposed based on two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal photonic crystal ring resonators. The transmission spectra of PCRR configuration has been investigated by using the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method in a Hexagonal lattice GaAs rods photonic crystal structure. The Photonic Bandgap (PBG) of the designed structure is calculated by Plane Wave Expansion (PWE) method. In this paper PhC design has been optimized for telecommunication wavelength 1511 nm. The number of rods in X and Z directions are 19 and 23, with lattice constant 0.540 nm and 0.1 μm rod radius. The designed structure is useful for CWDM optical communication systems and may serve as a key component in photonic integrated circuits. Scatterer rod radius analysis is also done in this paper to improve the dropping efficiency around 99%. The device is ultra compact with the overall size around 127 μm2. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Due to diverse applications in the field of science and engineering, study of bi-metallic nano alloy clusters is very much popular. Among such nano clusters, the compound formed between Cu-Ag has gained considerable interest because of their unique optical, electronic and magnetic properties. Density functional theory (DFT) is one of the most popular techniques of quantum mechanics to study the electronic properties of materials. Conceptual DFT-based descriptors are indispensable tools to correlate the experimental properties of nano compounds and composites. In this report, we have studied CuAgn; (n = 1-8) nano alloy clusters within theoretical framework of DFT at B3LYP level. The calculated nano alloy clusters show interesting odd-even oscillation behaviors, indicating even number of clusters show higher stability as compare to their neighbor odd number clusters. A close agreement between experimental bond length and computed data also reflect in this analysis. © 2018 by Apple Academic Press, Inc.},

abstract={With the advancement in technology and the rising need to remain connected to the Internet even while on the move, Network Mobility (NEMO) has come into existence. It is an extension of mobile IPv6 which enables a set of nodes to collectively move from one place to another without disrupting their connection to the Internet. In hierarchical NEMO, due to the high degree of nesting in mobile network, pinball routing problem, inefficient route and end to end delay in packet transmission are quite common. Therefore, considering these problems, we have come up with a solution called Route Optimization for Inter and Intra Network (ROIIN) which will provide one tunnel solution in case of inter-network packet transmission and an efficient route optimization in case of intra-network communications. The proposed solution is simulated in NS2 and the observed results of our simulation shows better efficiency as compared to the existing solutions. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, London.},

abstract={In recent years, major industrial sectors such as automotive, aerospace, building, biomedical, and others have increasingly been employing polymer composites for structural applications, but these polymers are known to exhibit poor adhesion characteristics owing to their low surface free energy (SFE) and lack of polar functional groups on their surfaces. This chapter discusses the effect of modifying polymer surfaces by different plasma techniques on the SFE and surface roughness of the polymers, which play an important role in improving adhesive bond strength. This chapter highlights the importance of plasma for surface activation of polymer composites to form structural parts using adhesive bonding for high-end applications. The chapter is divided into five sections. Section 3.1 gives an introduction to the chapter. Section 3.2 gives a brief summary of the adhesives being used for high-end applications. Section 3.3 gives a detailed overview of the adhesion phenomenon, its mechanisms, wetting, adhesion in polymer systems, and the need for surface modification. Section 3.4 outlines the different types of surface modification techniques, their advantages, and disadvantages. Section 3.5 gives a detailed overview of the effects of plasma on the physicochemical properties of polymer composites by characterizing the plasma-treated samples. © 2018 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={This paper deals with unsteady oscillatory flow of viscous incompressible fluid with heat & mass transfer in a horizontal channel partially occupied by porous medium following the Darcy-Brinkman model. The inner territory of the channel consists of two regions; one of them is filled with porous material and second is clear fluid. At the porous medium fluid interface, interfacial coupling conditions for the fluid velocity, temperature and concentration were used to derive the analytical solution. Some standard values of Schmidt number like Hydrogen(0.22), Helium(0.30), Amonia(0.78); Eckert number (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2) and Prandtl number for water(0.71) and Air(7.0) was considered in this paper. The effects of pertinent physical fluid parameter like porosity, viscosity ratio, density ratio etc. on velocity, temperature and concentration distribution are considered and demonstrated through graphs. Heavier diffusive species and high molecular diffusivity ratio decreases the fluid concentration throughout the region. Increasing values of Prandtl number upsurge the fluid temperature throughout the region. © 2017 ANAME Publication. All rights reserved.},

It focuses on contractor's implementation of LPS to analyze how lean construction techniques improve performance and productivity. To achieve this, action research model was undertaken. The research was carried out in a Bishop Heber college construction site, where multipurpose buildings were being constructed by a sole contractor. A comparison-based survey was conducted with construction professionals to identify current practices and exposure LPS has in India. The results reveal that implementing LPS had significant improvements over traditional management and a notable increase in average Percentage Plan Completed. This progress was enabled by the way the site was planned, managed and controlled using LPS. The paper concludes by discussing ing results of implementing LPS, including benefits, barriers, and the critical success factors for this project.

abstract={The work initially isolates and identifies the bacteria from pharmaceutical industrial wastewaters having amidase activity and then immobilizes and optimizes the reaction conditions adopting variants of batch, fed batch and continuous reactor system for maximum bioconversion of acetamide to acetohydroxamic acid. The maximum acyltransferase activity was obtained in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) with substrate concentration 0.850 mmoles of acetamide and 1.7 mmoles of hydroxylamine hydrochloride with resting cells 0.94 mg (cell dry weight) (0.322 Uml-1) for 20 min at 55 °C. It had showed broad substrate specificity. Acetamide was the best substrate followed by acetonitrile. Industrial wastewater contains a large number of metal ions thus in view of future application of this research for real pharmaceutical wastewater treatment, the effect of a various metal ions on the immobilized cells was studied. Among the various metal ions and inhibitors, AgNO3 had only severely affected the enzyme activity. The short operation time of the proposed process, coupled with the possibility of an enzyme reuse during several cycles, are effective tools to implement this economically competitive semi-continuous reactor for amide biodegradation in pharmaceutical wastewaters. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

abstract={A series of multifunctional carbohydrazide based chromofluorescent sensor molecules derived from carbohydrazide, 4-formyl-1-substituted phenyl-pyrazole-3-carboxylate and 2-hydroxy-naphthaldehyde were successfully designed and synthesized. The synthesized sensor molecules exhibit significant red shift in their absorption spectra with visual color changes on interaction with Cu(II) and Zn(II) ions. In addition, the optimized sensor showed excellent selectivity towards Cu(II) and Zn(II) ions with fluorescence “turn off” and “turn on” modes respectively. Along with this, anion recognition studies were carried out using UV-visible and fluorescence spectrophotometric titrations which revealed that synthesized sensors also exhibit selective sensing of F − , CH 3 COO − and H 2 PO 4 − ions via H-bond interaction and subsequent deprotonation to elicit distinct visual color change from light yellow to orange with significant quenching in its emission intensity. Furthermore, the in-situ prepared sensor-anion adduct solution exhibited colorimetric “On-Off” sensing of Cu(II) and Zn(II) ions, which was confirmed through UV-visible titration experiments. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

abstract={Purpose - The purpose of this study is to analyze magnetohydrodynamic three-dimensional flow of Casson nanofluid over a stretching sheet in presence of thermophoresis and Brownian motion effects. In contrast, the convective surface boundary conditions with the effects of radiation are applied. Design/methodology/approach - The governing partial differential equations are transformed into highly nonlinear coupled ordinary differential equations consisting of the momentum, energy and nanoparticle concentration via suitable similarity transformations, which are then solved the using optimal homotopy analysis method (OHAM) a Mathematica Package BVPh2.0. Findings - The influence of emerging physical flow parameters on fluid velocity component, temperature distribution and nanoparticle concentration are discussed in detail. Also, anOHAM solution demonstrates very good correlation with those obtained in the previously published results. It is noticed that OHAM can overcome the earlier restriction, assumptions and limitation of traditional perturbation method. The main advantage of this method is that OHAM can be applied directly to nonlinear differential equations without using linearization and round-off errors, and therefore, it cannot be affected by error associated to discretization. Originality/value - Here the approximate solutions are compared with the numerical results published in earlier work. © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={In this paper, the optoelectronic nature of the CdGa2 X4 (X = S, Se) solar cell materials are examined using full potential linear augmented plane wave (FP-LAPW) method as embodied in WIEN2K code. In present computation, we have used most suitable modified Backe-Johnson (mBJ) potential under the framework of density functional theory (DFT). The calculated electronic properties like energy band structure and density of states spectra show that these materials exhibit a direct band gap (Γ–Γ) result of 3.22 eV and 2.36 eV for CdGa2 S4 and CdGa2 Se4 compounds, respectively. Absorption spectra for CdGa2 X4 (X = S, Se) compounds have been studied and it has been found that above the band gap, absorption are taking place and it covers wide visible spectrum energy range.

abstract={An analytical investigation is presented to study the unsteady peristaltic transport of nanofluids. Three different geometries of nanoparticle viz bricks, cylinder and platelets are considered in our analysis. The flow geometry is taken as nonuniform channel of finite length to explore our model for wide range of biomedical applications. Exact solutions are obtained for the non-dimensional governing equations subject to physically realistic boundary conditions. The effects of nanoparticle shapes on effective thermal conductivity, axial velocity, transverse velocity, temperature, and pressure difference distributions along the length of non-uniform channel with variation of different flow parameters are discussed with the help of graphical illustrations. It is observed that platelet shaped nanoparticles carry maximum velocity whereas brick shaped nanoparticles are the best to enhance the thermal conductivity. An inherent property of peristaltic transport i.e. trapping is also discussed. This model is applicable in drugs delivery system where different geometries of drugs are delivered and it is also applicable to design a microperistaltic pump for transportation of nanofluids. © 2017 The Authors},

Indian policy makers have been apprehensive about vertical unbundling citing negative experiences from British Railways. The authors believe that given the framework that vertical unbundling provides for leveraging private investments and operational efficiencies, it should be explored as an option for IR. This paper is an attempt in this direction wherein the unbundling of policy making, infrastructure and services is explored. Authors have studied the German Railway Reform in depth and explored the implications of similar unbundling for IR.},

abstract={In many industrial situations, machines are subjected to random breakdowns. In this paper, we consider the asynchronous vacation policy for the multi-server machine repair problem with server breakdown and two types of spares. According to this policy, when a certain number of servers become idle at a service completion instant, the servers will take an asynchronous vacation of random length together. If the servers find no waiting failed unit in the system and the number of servers on vacation is less than the total number of servers, then these servers can take vacation individually and continue to take vacation if the vacation condition is satisfied. Each server is subject to breakdowns in working state only and can be repaired according to exponential service time distribution. Matrix geometric method is used to obtain the queue size distribution. Various performance measures viz. the expected number of the idle servers, busy servers and vacationing servers, etc. are determined. The sensitivity analysis is made to examine the effect of parameters on various performance measures. Copyright © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={The present article studies theoretically the electrokinetic pumping of nanofluids with heat and mass transfer in a micro-channel under peristaltic waves, a topic of some interest in medical nano-scale electro-osmotic devices. The microchannel walls are deformable and transmit periodic waves. The Chakraborty-Roy nanofluid electrokinetic formulation is adopted in which Joule heating effects are incorporated. Soret and Dufour cross-diffusion effects are also considered. Under low Reynolds number (negligible inertial effects), long wavelength and Debye linearization approximations, the governing partial differential equations for mass, momentum, energy and solute concentration conservation are derived with appropriate boundary conditions at the micro-channel walls. The merging model features a number of important thermo-physical, electrical and nanoscale parameter, namely thermal and solutal Grashof numbers, the Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity (maximum electro-osmotic velocity) and Joule heating to surface heat flux ratio. Closed-form solutions are derived for the solute concentration, temperature, axial velocity, averaged volumetric flow rate, pressure difference across one wavelength, and stream function distribution in the wave frame. Additionally expressions are presented for the surface shear stress function at the wall (skin friction coefficient), wall heat transfer rate (Nusselt number) and wall solute mass transfer rate (Sherwood number). The influence of selected parameters on these flow variables is studied with the aid of graphs. Bolus formation is also visualized and analyzed in detail. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The inventive use of language in different areas by humans makes them creative and innovative. The use of innovative language in advertisements is to hold the attention of consumers and to motivate them to purchase different products. They (advertisers) use different and updated language techniques in advertising; one of them is code mixing (CM), which refers to the mixing of words from different languages in a systematic pattern. This paper intended to provide the role and impact of code • mixing in advertising in India through the interviews conducted from 100 individuals. This will result in understanding the concept of code - mixing from the perspective of 'global advertising strategy'. Additionally, it would help in understanding the cultural identities of other regions and 'social responsibilities'. The results obtained from lexical analysis of code mixed advertisements and readers' attitudinal surveys showed that the linguistic factors of advertisements are designed keeping multilingual reader's psychology in mind. Advertisers strategically utilize their linguistic creativity by including different symbolic meanings in their creative linguistic repertoire. It helps in keeping the product memorable. In order to fulfil the purpose of the study, quantitative approach was used to check whether code mixing in advertisements works as a successful language strategy in having imprints on consumers' minds. The paper provides new explanations using exploratory and descriptive analysis that would be helpful as an evidence to enhance the quality of communication in marketing. It will further provide insights to the advertisers forthe development of new marketing policies.},

abstract={Analytical solutions are developed for the electro-kinetic flow of a viscoelastic biological liquid in a finite length cylindrical capillary geometry under peristaltic waves. The Jefferys’ non-Newtonian constitutive model is employed to characterize rheological properties of the fluid. The unsteady conservation equations for mass and momentum with electro-kinetic and Darcian porous medium drag force terms are reduced to a system of steady linearized conservation equations in an axisymmetric coordinate system. The long wavelength, creeping (low Reynolds number) and Debye–Hückel linearization approximations are utilized. The resulting boundary value problem is shown to be controlled by a number of parameters including the electro-osmotic parameter, Helmholtz–Smoluchowski velocity (maximum electro-osmotic velocity), and Jefferys’ first parameter (ratio of relaxation and retardation time), wave amplitude. The influence of these parameters and also time on axial velocity, pressure difference, maximum volumetric flow rate and streamline distributions (for elucidating trapping phenomena) is visualized graphically and interpreted in detail. Pressure difference magnitudes are enhanced consistently with both increasing electro-osmotic parameter and Helmholtz–Smoluchowski velocity, whereas they are only elevated with increasing Jefferys’ first parameter for positive volumetric flow rates. Maximum time averaged flow rate is enhanced with increasing electro-osmotic parameter, Helmholtz–Smoluchowski velocity and Jefferys’ first parameter. Axial flow is accelerated in the core (plug) region of the conduit with greater values of electro-osmotic parameter and Helmholtz–Smoluchowski velocity whereas it is significantly decelerated with increasing Jefferys’ first parameter. The simulations find applications in electro-osmotic (EO) transport processes in capillary physiology and also bio-inspired EO pump devices in chemical and aerospace engineering. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={This paper describes the performance of thermal storage integrated micro-cogeneration system based on single cylinder diesel engine. In addition to electricity generated from genset, waste heat from hot exhaust of diesel engine was used to heat water in a double pipe heat exchanger of 67.70 cm length with inside tube diameter of 3.81 cm and outside tube diameter of 5.08 cm. Additionally, a latent heat thermal energy storage system was also integrated with this cogeneration system. A shell and tube type heat exchanger of 346 mm diameter and 420 mm height with 45 tubes of 18 mm diameter each was designed and fabricated, to store thermal energy, in which Erythritol (C4H10O4) was used as phase changing material. The test results show that micro capacity (4.4 kW), stationary, single cylinder, diesel engine can be successfully utilized to simultaneously produce power as well as heating, and to also store thermal energy. Slight decrease in engine performance was observed when double pipe heat exchanger and latent heat thermal energy storage system was integrated with engine but the amount of energy which could be recovered was significant. Maximum percentage of energy saved was obtained at a load of 3.6 kW and was 15.2%. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Old engines (Euro III or earlier) produce more emissions, and it will be difficult to entirely stop their usage especially in developing and under-developed nations; hence, it is desired that appropriate emission reduction technologies are tested on such engines to analyze their feasibility and economical acceptability. While most such studies have been conducted on constant speed stationary engines and modern engines, this study tried to analyze the effectiveness of an uncoated wall-flow type ceramic diesel particulate filter on a Euro-I, water-cooled, direct injection, variable speed, compression ignition engine in a laboratory set-up in India. Also, this study focused on diesel particulate filter regeneration by two methods: active regeneration by diesel injection in the particulate filter using an electronic control unit and off-board regeneration by taking out and heating the diesel particulate filter in an electrical resistance furnace at 650 °C for 10 h. The results, in the form of smoke emission, NOx emission and engine performance, obtained using both the regeneration methods were analyzed, and conclusions were drawn. It was found that using diesel particulate filter, particulate matter emissions (smoke) were almost entirely eliminated. It was also found that off-board regeneration had numerous advantages compared to active regeneration. Since a furnace would be needed for off-board regeneration, an exchange process for diesel particulate filter is suggested. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={In this paper, we report ab initio studies of structural, electronic and elastic properties of a II-V group semiconductor compound, Zn3As2 along with its experimental Compton profile (CP). For experimental CP, 59.54 keV gamma ray (radiation source:5 Ci 241Am) spectrometer is used and to deal with the theoretical part, density functional theory, Hartree-Fock as well as the hybrid functional theory, implemented in CRYSTAL code, are used. A full structure optimization following an equation of state calculation is performed to get the structural parameters. Further directional CPs, band structure, density of states, Mulliken population analysis and elastic properties have also been computed. A concurrence-test with experimental CP proves hybrid scheme to provide the best results in the present case. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Necessity of opening of energy gap in the band structure of, otherwise a zero gap semiconductor, graphene, is a must for its use in fabrication of high speed electronic devices. One such technique, for opening of energy gap in graphene, is by way of doping the pristine graphene with boron or nitrogen. Besides many important applications, to which B- and N-doped graphene has been put, the one very important for solving the global energy crisis is by way of its capacity for hydrogen storage. In this paper electronic structure of B- and N-doped graphene has been studied by using Density Functional Theory, as implemented in WIEN2K code. PBE-GGA (Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof 96) pseudo-potential is used for solving the Schrodinger equation in self-consistent manner and to account for the exchange and correlation effects through the use of Generalized Gradient Approximation. The band structure calculations reveal that whereas a band gap opens at the symmetry point K both for B- and N-doped graphene, the center of the gap (i.e., the Dirac point in pristine graphene) is shifted above the Fermi level by about 2.20 eV for B-doped graphene, and shifted down the Fermi level by about the same amount for N-doped graphene, when the doping level was kept 25% in each case. The energy gap opened was found to be about 0.30 eV for B-doped graphene and 0.45 eV for N-doped graphene. The linear dispersion characteristics obtained at Dirac point for pristine graphene, almost vanish for B-/N-doped graphene, due to symmetry breaking and opening of energy gap. The band structure and Density of States of B-/N-doped graphene are found also to depend on the choice of cell parameters. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Sludge reduction by physico-chemical methods results in the buildup of chemicals, which may require further treatment. Owing these reasons various biologically sustainable methods of sludge reduction including the application of high oxygenation have been successfully tested. Experiments on actual sewage in two lab-scale sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) were conducted under normal (1.5–2.5 mgDO/L) and high dissolved oxygen (DO) (HDO: 3–6.5 mgDO/L) regimes. It was observed that microorganism allocated substrate between maintenance and growth in the form of maintenance coefficient. Which could be induced by endogenous respiration owing to high solids retention time (SRT), predation on bacteria, chemical toxicity, adverse environment, and viral attack on bacteria. The wastewater treatment process may experience one or more maintenance inducing factors; nevertheless, high SRT and prevailing environmental conditions are imminent and thus considered as primary maintenance (mp), while remaining are classified as secondary maintenance (ms). Average yield coefficient reduction at HDO was 32.7% and 28.2% compared to stoichiometric and at normal DO, respectively. The observed primary and secondary maintenance was 0.11gCOD/gVSS.d (±0.01) at an SRT of 25.2 d (±2.0) and 0.096 g 0.1 gCOD/gVSS.d (±0.045) at an SRT of 24.2 d (±3.6d), respectively. The results obtained under the study are not as precise as on pure culture and defined substrate, nevertheless, it gives an idea that how stress factors inducing maintenance need to be addressed more seriously and objectively while managing our efforts on sludge reduction. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={India is a country where major part of its population lives in rural area and majority of rural people are deprived from the very basic amenities. There are approximately 900 villages in Mathura district. These villages are not in very good condition and do not cater to the basic needs of villages i.e. education, healthcare, employment etc. The aim of this article to demonstrate through various developmental proposals that village can be self-contained in itself by understanding & identifying the potential of that place. For the demonstration of sustainable development, village sameri of Mathura district has been taken up. The main aim of this project is to upgrade built environment of village and living conditions of villagers which include the socio-economic well-being, livable atmosphere, educational up liftment and societal integrity of the people living in the village. It is intended to show various stages of village development without degrading the environment. The article is divided into three sections: familiarization with the place, identification of issues and finally typical proposals which can also be adopted in other villages of Mathura district. The last section of conclusion and recommendation is not merely based upon theoretical study but detail surveys which were carried out by subsequent visit to the village. It is hoped that this little work will contribute in some measures to serve the society and nation. © 2016 IEEE.},

Conventional Z-Source breaker (ZSB) topologies can provide protection for unidirectional power flow. Proposed topologies of bi-directional ZSB (Bi-ZSB) and bi-directional ZSB with coupled inductor (Bi-CZSB) can clear the fault in either direction of power flow. Both topologies utilize a SCR as a switch to instantly isolate the fault from source. No sensing and detection of fault is required. For second topology, mutual inductance is used for SCR commutation. Coupled inductors help to reduce size of inductors, cost and also eliminate the need of additional Z-Source breaker capacitor. Performance of both topologies is verified in MATLAB and validated on laboratory prototype. © 2016 IEEE.},

Such approach incorporates the value of trust to ensure desired customer retention. The procedure further intensifies when an organizational approach emphasize effective complaint handling system within its service protocol. Based on this established relationship, this study explores the viability of the framework in the presence of customer complain intention categories with Indian context. Data for this descriptive study are collected using a structured questionnaire from 450 respondents. Out of the three types of complainants (consumer complaint intention), voice complaint intention appeared as the strongest determinant of consumer trust and retention as compared to private and third party complaint intention. On providing complaint handling, the strength of the relationship improved to the greatest extent for private complaint intention while there was no effect of complaint handling for voice complaint intention. Results of the study highlight as to what extent complaint handling matters for different types of complainants (voice, private and third party). Such practices can help the retailers distinguish and accordingly handle various types of complainants. Effective complaint handling practices can make the complainants more trustworthy and loyal than before. © 2016, © 2016 Management Development Institute.},

abstract={Background: Eco-friendly synthesis of nanoparticles is viewed as an alternative to the chemical method and initiated the use of microorganisms for synthesis. The present study has been designed to utilize plant pathogenic fungi Sclerotinia sclerotiorum MTCC 8785 strain for synthesis and optimization of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) production as well as evaluation of antibacterial properties. The AgNPs were synthesized by reduction of aqueous silver nitrate (AgNO3) solution after incubation of 3–5 days at room temperature. The AgNPs were further characterized using UV–visible spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Reaction parameters including media, fungal biomass, AgNO3 concentration, pH and temperature were further optimized for rapid AgNPs production. The antibacterial efficacy of AgNPs was evaluated against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 by disc diffusion and growth kinetics assay at the concentration determined by the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Results: AgNPs synthesis was initially marked by the change in colour from pale white to brown and was confirmed by UV–Vis spectroscopy. Optimization studies showed that potato dextrose broth (PDB) media, 10 g of biomass, addition of 2 mM AgNO3, pH 11 and 80 °C temperature resulted in enhanced AgNPs synthesis through extracellular route. TEM data revealed spherical shape AgNPs with size in the range of 10 nm. Presence of proteins capped to AgNPs was confirmed by FTIR. AgNPs showed antibacterial activity against E. coli and S. aureus at 100 ppm concentration, corresponding MIC value. Conclusion: S. sclerotiorum MTCC 8785 mediated AgNPs was synthesized rapidly under optimized conditions, which showed antibacterial activity. © 2016, The Author(s).},

abstract={This paper aims to open a new vista of research in the direction of possible application of power electronics DC-DC converters in analog chaotic communication. Most of the work reported on analog chaotic communication is based on the pioneer work of Pecora and Caroll, with synchronization between transmitter and receiver. Receiver based on synchronization, also known as coherent receiver, has a disadvantage of parameter mismatch and is sensitive to noise. In the present work, firstly, a secure transmitter using chaotic DC-DC converters is proposed that encrypts information using chaotic switching map technique. In chaotic switching map technique, the message is encrypted by randomly switching from one chaotic converter to another. The bifurcation parameter of the randomly switched chaotic converter is modulated by the message. Secondly, an attempt has been made to design a robust non-coherent receiver that is adaptable to the switching chaotic transmitters, even in the presence of noise. Once the receiver identifies the chaotic converter, it can decode the message as per the decryption algorithm. With the proposed non-coherent receiver, the disadvantages of coherent receivers can be overcome. We have also devised a prototype smart meter, used in smart distribution grid for implementing the proposed communication technique. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

abstract={This paper explores how technological advances can help in better diagnosis of cancer affected region of the brain. There has been exponential increase in brain tumor cases in recent pasts and there has been a gap in existing technology for root cause analysis. New reports indicate that various brain tumors can be treated through surgery and in exceptional cases with radiation. Image segmentation provides huge potential in diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors. Image segmentation helps to find volume and growth of tumor with usage of techniques such as human edge correction, outer edge coloring and inter active thresholds holdings. There is critical requirement to find out an automatic or semi automatic method for classification of brain tumor images, to eliminate human error and provide accurate results in MRI images. A new approach 'LSF HYBRID model' has been developed for detention and classification of brain cancer. System dependant actions such mechanisms leverage To locate the block and classify the brain tumor, this LSF HYBRID method users system dependant actions. It also utilizes other mechanisms such as Image enhancement, segmentation and Equalization of histogram. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Multidrug resistance of the pathogenic microorganisms to the antimicrobial drugs has become a major impediment toward successful diagnosis and management of infectious diseases. Recent advancements in nanotechnology-based medicines have opened new horizons for combating multidrug resistance in microorganisms. In particular, the use of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) as a potent antibacterial agent has received much attention. The most critical physico-chemical parameters that affect the antimicrobial potential of AgNPs include size, shape, surface charge, concentration and colloidal state. AgNPs exhibits their antimicrobial potential through multifaceted mechanisms. AgNPs adhesion to microbial cells, penetration inside the cells, ROS and free radical generation, and modulation of microbial signal transduction pathways have been recognized as the most prominent modes of antimicrobial action. On the other side, AgNPs exposure to human cells induces cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, and inflammatory response in human cells in a cell-type dependent manner. This has raised concerns regarding use of AgNPs in therapeutics and drug delivery. We have summarized the emerging endeavors that address current challenges in relation to safe use of AgNPs in therapeutics and drug delivery platforms. Based on research done so far, we believe that AgNPs can be engineered so as to increase their efficacy, stability, specificity, biosafety and biocompatibility. In this regard, three perspectives research directions have been suggested that include (1) synthesizing AgNPs with controlled physico-chemical properties, (2) examining microbial development of resistance toward AgNPs, and (3) ascertaining the susceptibility of cytoxicity, genotoxicity, and inflammatory response to human cells upon AgNPs exposure. © 2016 Dakal, Kumar, Majumdar and Yadav.},

abstract={The recognition of handwritten similar shape characters are still a challenging problem in HOCR system. Almost entire scripts are suffering with this kind of problem. This manuscript is considered the similar shape character problem in Devanagari script. An algorithm is proposed first to estimate the similar character pairs in Devanagari Script and 7 pairs are identified by investigating the confusion matrix. Similar shape characters have very minor difference in shape that's why at the time of recognition (classification) phase, classifier is being confused with another similar shape characters. This problem can be solved by estimate that minor difference called critical region in the similar shape characters and used critical region to extract the more features before classification phase. The critical region is estimated by Fisher discrimination function. A new kind of masking techniques used to extract the features from ISIDCHAR (standard Devanagari database) and 96.58 % recognition rate is obtained finally after getting the 81.94% improvement in similar character recognition. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Effort estimation techniques play a crucial role in planning of the development of web-based applications. Web-based software projects, considered in the present-day scenario are different from conventional object oriented projects, and hence the task of effort estimation is a complex one. It is observed that the literature do not provide a guidance to the analysts to use a particular model as being the most suitable one, for effort estimation of web-based applications. A number of models like IFPUG Function Point Model, NESMA, MARK-II, etc. are being considered for web effort estimation purpose. The efficiency of these models can be improved by employing certain intelligent techniques on them. Keeping in mind the end goal to enhance the efficiency of evaluating the effort required to develop web-based application, certain machine learning techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Boosting and Support Vector Regression Kernels are considered in this study for effort estimation of web-based applications using IFPUG Function Point approach. The ISBSG dataset, Release 12 has been considered in this study for obtaining the IFPUG Function Point data.

abstract={Transition metal substituted Titanium oxide (TiO2) has drawn a great deal of attention due to its excellent properties like solar cell as an EHP generator, physical properties which makes it suitable for various thin film applications i.e., in photo catalysis, Solar cell and gas sensor. When irradiated with UV light, TiO2 nanosized powder shows strong Oxidizability and reducibility. Ti0.9Mn0.05Fe0.05O2 sample synthesis was carried out by Solgel wet chemical precipitation route at temperature 350 °C. The crystallinity and the structure of doped TiO2 is determined by X-ray diffraction using Cu–Kα radiations operated at 40 kV and 35 mA in the range of 20° to 80°. The pattern gets indexed in Tetragonal structure and confirms the single phase material with no impurity. The morphological analysis of the sample is carried out by Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements. TEM image shows the irregular shape of the nanoparticles and particle size lies in the range of 75–125 nm. In the FT-IR spectrum of Ti0.9Mn0.05Fe0.05O2, the peak at 715.44 cm−1 shows bending and stretching mode of vibration of Ti–O and peaks at 1399.91 cm−1 shows stretching vibration of Ti–O–Ti. © 2016 American Scientific Publishers.

abstract={Over the past few years, designing of progressive visual recovery technique has been studied by many researchers. Previous research on PVC were all carrying pixel-expansion problem. Young et al. (2013) suggested a new dimension of Progressive visual secret sharing with the feature of Block based encoding and recovery of an original secret. In the Young scheme (2013), a secret image is subdivided into n non-overlapped image sections. When L (2 ≤ L ≤ n) participants stack their shadow images, all the image sections associated with these L participants will be recovered. In this article, the scheme suggested for a block based progressive scheme is critically analyzed and we show that leakage of secret information is possible in the scheme during the encoding process of the shares. Further, we propose a new robust progressive algorithm based on the logistic chaotic map to overcome the said limitation. The irregular outputs of the logistic map are used to encode a secret digital image. To provide robustness during the encoding process of the share, noise has been introduced along with chaotic sequences. The performance of the algorithm in the scheme of Young is critically analyzed and compared with the new suggested scheme. The empirical results are presented to showcase the performance of our proposed scheme in terms of its effectiveness and feasibility. © 2016 Taru Publications.},

Metachronal wave is generated by the beating of cilia and mathematically modeled as elliptical wave propagation by Blake (1971). Methods, results and conclusions The problem is formulated in the form of nonlinear partial differential equations, which are simplified by using the dimensional analysis to avoid the complicacy of dimensional homogeneity. Lubrication theory is employed to linearize the governing equations and it is also physically appropriate for cilia movement. Analytical solutions for velocity, temperature and pressure gradient and stream function are obtained. The analytical results are numerically simulated by using the Mathematica Software and plotted the graphs for velocity profile, temperature profile, pressure gradient and stream lines for better discussion and visualization.

abstract={A theoretical investigation of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flow and heat transfer of electrically-conducting viscoplastic fluids through a channel is conducted. The robust Casson model is implemented to simulate viscoplastic behavior of fluids. The external magnetic field is oblique to the fluid flow direction. Viscous dissipation effects are included. The flow is controlled by the metachronal wave propagation generated by cilia beating on the inner walls of the channel. The mathematical formulation is based on deformation in longitudinal and transverse velocity components induced by the ciliary beating phenomenon with cilia assumed to follow elliptic trajectories. The model also features velocity and thermal slip boundary conditions. Closed-form solutions to the non-dimensional boundary value problem are obtained under physiological limitations of low Reynolds number and large wavelength. The influence of key hydrodynamic and thermo-physical parameters i.e. Hartmann (magnetic) number, Casson (viscoplastic) fluid parameter, thermal slip parameter and velocity slip parameter on flow characteristics are investigated. A comparative study is also made with Newtonian fluids (corresponding to massive values of plastic viscosity). Stream lines are plotted to visualize trapping phenomenon. The computations reveal that velocity increases with increasing the magnitude of Hartmann number near the channel walls whereas in the core flow region (center of the channel) significant deceleration is observed. Temperature is elevated with greater Casson parameter, Hartmann number, velocity slip, eccentricity parameter, thermal slip and also Brinkmann (dissipation) number. Furthermore greater Casson parameter is found to elevate the quantity and size of the trapped bolus. In the pumping region, the pressure rise is reduced with greater Hartmann number, velocity slip, and wave number whereas it is enhanced with greater cilia length. © 2016 IAA.},

abstract={In this study, electronic and optical properties of AunGe (n=1-9) nanoalloy clusters are systematically investigated in terms of the Density Functional Theory (DFT) with the Becke, three parameter, Lee-Yang-Parr (B3LYP) exchange correlation functional. Conceptual DFT based global descriptors have turned to be indispensable tools for correlating the experimental properties of compounds. In this study, experimental properties of AunGe (n=1-9) nanoalloy clusters are correlated in terms of DFT based descriptors viz. HOMO-LUMO gap, Global Hardness (n), Global Softness (S), Electronegativity (x) and Electrophilicity Index (ra). Our computed bond length exhibits a close agreement with experimental data. The high value of regression coefficient between global softness and HOMO-LUMO gap supports and validates our predicted model. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The influence of transverse magnetic field on time-dependent peristaltic transport of electrically-conducting fluids through a microchannel under an applied external electric field with induced electric field effect is considered, based on lubrication theory approximations. The electrohydrodynamic (EHD) problem is also simplified under the Debye linearization. Closed-form solutions for the linearized dimensionless boundary value problem are derived. With increasing Hartmann number, the formation of bolus in the regime (associated with trapping) is inhibited up to a critical value of magnetic field. Flow rate, axial velocity and local wall shear stress are strongly decreased with greater Hartmann number whereas pressure difference is enhanced with higher Hartmann number at low time values but reduced with greater elapse in time. With greater electro-osmotic parameter (i.e. smaller Debye length), maximum time-averaged flow rate is enhanced, whereas the axial velocity is reduced. An increase in electrical field parameter (i.e. maximum electro-osmotic velocity) causes an increase in maximum time-averaged flow rate. The simulations find applications in electromagnetic peristaltic micro-pumps in medical engineering and also “smart” fluid pumping systems in nuclear and aerospace industries. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The present study investigates the role of temperature in the formation of multiwalled carbon nanotubes from carbon black using arc discharge technique. Carbon black has been used as precursor to synthesize carbon nanotubes in argon atmosphere. The arc current has been varied from 25 to 40 A in order to study the morphological changes in carbon black as it gets converted to multi walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs).We observed formation ofMWCNTsat an arc current of 25 A; however the recorded temperature data suggested correlation of sustained arc temperature with the nanotube formation rather than the magnitude of current in its absoluteness. Interesting to note is that reported current magnitude in published literature are very high (>40 A) for conversion of carbon black but the present investigation shows that it is possible to convert the carbon black toMWCNTseven at lower current values in case the arc temperature is stabilized and sustained for longer period. Detailed investigations suggested that a sustained stable critical temperature of 1400 °C-1600 °Cis essential for the growth of nanotubes and an unstable arc causing temperature fluctuation from critical temperature value yields very low or no MWCNTs. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Alterations in optical transitions and distortions in wave symmetry in nano-scale QW (quantum well) heterostructures are seen due to external uniaxial strain under different polarizations. This paper reports the anisotropy phenomena and optical gain improvement realized in In0.3Ga0.7As/GaAs0.4Sb0.6 type-II QW-heterostructure (well width = 20 Å) under uniaxial strain in the SWIR (short wave infra red) region. The detailed study of the band structure, wave functions associated with the charge carriers in the respective bands and optical gain under electromagnetic field perturbation is reported. The 6 × 6 diagonal k→·p→ Hamiltonian matrix is evaluated and Luttinger-Kohn model is used for the band structure calculation. Optical gain spectrum in the QW-heterostructure under uniaxial strain along [110] for different polarizations of light is calculated. For a charge carrier injection of 5 × 1012/cm2 the optical gain is ∼1600/cm under input z-polarization, ∼14500/cm under x-polarization and ∼15700/cm under y-polarization without external uniaxial strain applied. A significant improvement in optical gain is observed under uniaxial strain along [110] direction under different input polarizations. Keeping in views its utilization in optoelectronics due its very high optical gain in near-infra-red region in x- or y-polarization mode, such structure can be considered as a novel structure. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In this paper, a mathematical study is conducted of steady incompressible flow of a temperature-dependent viscous nanofluid from a vertical stretching sheet under applied external magnetic field and gravitational body force effects. The Reynolds exponential viscosity model is deployed. Electrically-conducting nanofluids are considered which comprise a suspension of uniform dimension nanoparticles suspended in viscous base fluid. The nanofluid sheet is extended with a linear velocity in the axial direction. The Buonjiornio model is utilized which features Brownian motion and thermophoresis effects. The partial differential equations for mass, momentum, energy and species (nano-particle concentration) are formulated with magnetic body force term. Viscous and Joule dissipation effects are neglected. The emerging nonlinear, coupled, boundary value problem is solved numerically using the Runge–Kutta fourth order method along with a shooting technique. Graphical solutions for velocity, temperature, concentration field, skin friction and Nusselt number are presented. Furthermore stream function plots are also included. Validation with Nakamura's finite difference algorithm is included. Increasing nanofluid viscosity is observed to enhance temperatures and concentrations but to reduce velocity magnitudes. Nusselt number is enhanced with both thermal and species Grashof numbers whereas it is reduced with increasing thermophoresis parameter and Schmidt number. The model is applicable in nano-material manufacturing processes involving extruding sheets. © 2016},

abstract={We investigate the velocity slip and thermal slip effects on peristaltically driven thermal transport of nanofluids through the vertical parallel plates under the influence of transverse magnetic field. The wall surface is propagating with sinusoidal wave velocity c. The flow characteristics are governed by the mass, momentum and energy conservation principle. Low Reynolds number and large wavelength approximations are taken into consideration to simplify the non-linear terms. Analytical solutions for axial velocity, temperature field, pressure gradient and stream function are obtained under certain physical boundary conditions. Two types of nanoparticles, SiO2 and Ag, are considered for analysis with water as base fluid. This is the first article in the literature that discusses the SiO2 and Ag nanoparticles for a peristaltic flow with variable viscosity. The effects of physical parameters on velocity, temperature, pressure and trapping are discussed. A comparative study of SiO2 nanofluid, Ag nanofluid and pure water is also presented. This model is applicable in biomedical engineering to make thermal peristaltic pumps and other pumping devices like syringe pumps, etc. It is observed that pressure for pure water is maximum and pressure for Ag nanofluid is minimum. © 2016, Società Italiana di Fisica and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={The human intestinal tract is a long, curved tube constituting the final section of the digestive system in which nutrients and water are mostly absorbed. Motivated by the dynamics of chyme in the intestine, a mathematical model is developed to simulate the associated transport phenomena via peristaltic transport. Rheology of chyme is modelled using the Nakamura-Sawada bi-viscosity non-Newtonian formulation. The intestinal tract is considered as a curved tube geometric model. Low Reynolds number (creeping hydrodynamics) and long wavelength approximations are taken into consideration. Analytical solutions of the moving boundary value problem are derived for velocity field, pressure gradient and pressure rise. Streamline flow visualization is achieved with Mathematica symbolic software. Peristaltic pumping phenomenon and trapping of the bolus are also examined. The influence of curvature parameter, apparent viscosity coefficient (rheological parameter) and volumetric flow rate on flow characteristics is described. Validation of analytical solutions is achieved with a MAPLE17 numerical quadrature algorithm.

abstract={This era belongs to the technology of automation. Achieving precision and accuracy in a task is now possible with the advent of automotive science and technology. Any crisis at any point of time can be now be dealt with autonomously. This paper presents a MATLAB Simulink model of a microgrid which is subjected to two faults which were detected and mitigated with the aid of a multi agent framework built in Java Agent Development Environment (JADE). Development and simulation of the microgrid in MATLAB-Simulink has been discussed at length. The model demonstrated is of decentralized radial configuration. It caters to the need of present scenario as it emphasizes on the electric vehicle battery oriented microgrid. It culminates Photovoltaic (PV) power plant with it making it more environmental friendly. The present era of environmental concern demands such a model microgrid which can fulfill the vision of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) in microgrid. The paper concludes on the note of successful restoration of system through the agents. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={An orthomode transducer for 9.3GHz to 9.5GHz frequency band has been designed and presented here. The Orthomode Transducers are widely used in dual-polarized systems such as radar antennas, radiometers, and communications links. Wherever there are two polarizations of radio signals (Horizontal and Vertical), the transmitted and received radio signal to and from the antenna are said to be orthogonal. This means that the modulation planes of the two radio signal waves are at 90 degrees to each other. The OMT designed here has been able to achieve isolation better than 40 dB and VSWR<1.42.

abstract={Increasing gap between demand and supply of energy has resulted in raised prices of conventional energy sources, and concern for clean environment has led to increase in use of renewable energy and focus on increased energy efficiency. In context of increased energy efficiency, energy storage and waste heat recovery play an important role as these systems improve overall efficiency of systems. In this study, a latent heat thermal energy storage system (LHTESS) for stationary C.I. engine exhaust heat was developed and integrated with engine. A shell and tube type heat exchanger having 346 mm diameter and 420 mm height with 45 numbers of tubes with 18 mm diameter was developed to store thermal energy, in which Erythritol (C4H10O4) was used as a phase change material. The engine performance and the thermal energy storage system performance parameters such as amount of heat stored, and charging efficiency were evaluated. Slight decrease in the engine performance was observed when latent heat thermal energy storage system was integrated to engine but amount of energy which could be recovered was significant. At a load of 4.4 kW the maximum charging efficiency, recovery efficiency and percentage energy saved was 69.53%, 38% and 11.33% respectively. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The rapid increase in population of India forced people to migrate from rural areas and small towns to metropolitan cities for better employment, education, and, good lifestyle. Major cities of India were industrialized and required more work force in metropolitan cities, leading to uncoordinated and unplanned growth, often termed as urban sprawl. Urban sprawl destroyed the natural resources such as open green space, agricultural land, open water bodies and ground water. In this paper, an attempt has been made to monitor urban sprawl using Shannon's Entropy model, Remote Sensing, and GIS for city Jaipur, India. The changed entropy value during the years 1972-2013 proves more dispersed growth in the city. The built-up area of Jaipur has increased from 40 km2 in 1972 to 400 km2 in 2013. Land use percentage of urban settlement is doubled as compared to the urban population of Jaipur during 1972-2013. This study shows remarkable urban sprawl in fringe areas of Jaipur city in the last 41 years. © Copyright 2016, IGI Global.},

abstract={The optical properties, namely refractive index (RI) studies, are reported on a series of pure and doped poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) in solution form. The PVA solutions were synthesized with 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 wt% of PVA in distilled water followed by doping with Rhodamine B in concentrations ranging from 0.05 wt% to 2 wt%. The absorption spectra show an observable shift in the band edge position towards higher wavelength with increase in PVA wt%. When the dopant molecules are added, the curves are drastically modified with the occurrence of new peaks arising at higher doping concentrations along with change in the bandgap. These effects are prominent for all the concentration of PVA solution. The RI does not change much for low doping wt%. but when dopant is added in higher concentrations, it increases slightly reaching a maximum of ∼1.35 at 2 wt%. It is observed that host polymer properties dominate at low doping while a combination of host polymer and dopant dye properties dominate at higher doping concentrations.

abstract={In this paper, a laboratory-based penning plasma discharge source is reported which has been developed in two anode configurations and is able to produce visible and VUV lights simultaneously. The developed source has simultaneous diagnostics facility using Langmuir probe and optical emission spectroscopy. The two anode configurations, namely, double ring and rectangular configurations, have been studied and compared for optimum use of the geometry for efficient light emissions and recording. The plasma is produced using helium gas and admixture of three noble gases including helium, neon, and argon. The source is capable to produce eight spectral lines for pure helium in the VUV range from 20 to 60 nm and total 24 spectral lines covering the wavelength range 20–106 nm for the admixture of gases. The large range of VUV lines is generated from gaseous admixture rather from the sputtered materials. The recorded spectrum shows that the plasma light radiations in both visible and VUV range are larger in double ring configuration than that of the rectangular configurations at the same discharge operating conditions. To clearly understand the difference, the imaging of the discharge using ICCD camera and particle-in-cell simulation using VORPAL have also been carried out. The effect of ion diffusion, metastable collision with the anode wall and the nonlinear effects are correlated to explain the results. © 2016, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

abstract={The interest in applying an external pressure on a nano-heterostructure is to attempt to extract more information about the electronic structure through distortion of the electronic structure. This paper reports the tunability of the optical gain under the high pressure effect in M-shaped type-II In0.70Ga0.30As/GaAs0.40Sb0.60 symmetric lasing nano-heterostructure designed for SWIR generation. In order to simulate the optical gain, the heterostructure has been modeled with the help of six band k.p method. The 6×6 diagonalized k.p Hamiltonian has been solved to evaluate the valence sub-bands (i.e. light and heavy hole energies); and then optical matrix elements and optical gain within TE (Transverse Electric) mode has been calculated. For the injected carrier density of 5×1012/cm2, the optimized optical gain within TE mode is as high as ∼9000/cm at the wavelength of ∼1.95 μm, thus providing a very important alternative material system for the generation of SWIR wavelength region. The application of very high pressure (2, 5 and 8 GPa) on the structure along [110] direction shows that the gain as well as lasing wavelength both approach to higher values. Thus, the structure can be tuned externally by the application of high pressure within the SWIR region. © 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The effect of annealing on the structural and magnetic properties of Co/Pt multilayers was studied as a function of annealing temperature. The ultrathin layers of Pt and Co were deposited to make [Pt 1nm/Co 1nm]x20 multilayer on Si (100) substrate using MBE technique. The structural, magnetic and electronic properties were recorded using XRD, SQUID and XPS techniques, respectively. M-H loop of as deposited sample shows soft magnetic nature with coercivity value of 350 Oe which increases to 974 Oe in 500°C annealed film. When studied at low temperature (5K), the coercivity of 592 Oe is obtained in the as deposited sample which increases to 1626 Oe after annealing. In addition, as revealed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, modifications in core level and valance band are observed. The observed changes in magnetic and electronic properties are attributed to structural modifications in correlation with the changes in (111) orientation of the films seen by X-ray diffraction. © 2016 Author(s).},

abstract={The observations of combination of Poly (vinyl) alcohol and Coumarin properties in nanocmposite films are reported. The X-ray diffraction measurements reveal nanocrystalline nature of PVA film, which remains nanocrystalline after doping Coumarin but along with PVA peaks, additional peak due to dopant crystallinity is seen. The absorption edge shows a double edge feature, where distinct bandgaps for PVA host and dopant Coumarin are obtained. However at a higher doping wt % of 1 and 2, the absorption is mainly dominated by Coumarin and single absorption edge is observed giving a bandgap equal to that of bulk Coumarin (3.3 eV). The composite formation affects the bonding of host drastically and is seen through the bond modification in FTIR spectra. The results suggest that doping below 2 wt% is advantageous as combination of PVA and Coumarin properties are obtained but at 2 wt %, the properties are dominated by mainly Coumarin and the signature of PVA from optical properties is completely lost. © 2016 Author(s).},

abstract={In the present scenario, there are growing concerns over the potential impacts of bioengineered nanoparticles in the health sector. However, our understanding of how bioengineered nanoparticles may affect organisms within natural ecosystems, lags far behind our rapidly increasing ability to engineer novel nanoparticles. To date, research on the biological impacts of bioengineered nanoparticles has primarily consisted of controlled lab studies of model organisms with single species in culture media. Here, we described a cost effective and environment friendly technique for green synthesis of silver nanoparticles. Silver nanoparticles were successfully synthesized from 1?mM AgNO3 via a green synthesis process using leaf extract as reducing as well as capping agent. Nanoparticles were characterized with the help of UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and TEM analysis which revealed the size of nanoparticles of 30-40?nm size. Further the nanoparticles synthesized by green route are found highly toxic against pathogenic bacteria and plant pathogenic fungi viz. Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas syringae and Sclerotiniasclerotiorum. The most important outcome of this work will be the development of value-Added products and protection of human health from pathogens viz., bacteria, virus, fungi etc. © 2016 Author(s).},

X-ray diffraction measurements showed that the annealing treatment has a strong impact on the crystal phase of TiO2 samples. The crystallite size as calculated from Debye Scherer formula lies in the range 29-69?nm and is found to increase with increase in annealing temperature.

The use of synchrotron radiation based valence band photoemission spectroscopy technique has been demonstrated which provides the variation in bandgap values as a function of annealing on [Si/Ge]x10 multilayers structure. For this purpose, the required VB offsets are obtained by considering the corresponding VB maximum of as prepared sample as a reference. The bandgap values thus obtained show a gradually decreasing pattern with increasing temperature, which is discussed in terms of the effect of various factors such as: (i) quantum confinement effect normally observed in confined systems (ii) change in the annealing induced intermixing leading to the formation of SiGe alloy and (iii) roughness at the surface/interface. © 2016 Author(s).},

abstract={We analyze the peristaltic motion of aqueous electrolytes altered by means of applied electric fields. Handling electrolytes in typical peristaltic channel material such as polyvinyl chloride and Teflon leads to the generation of a net surface charge on the channel walls, which attracts counter-ions and repels co-ions from the aqueous solution, thus leading to the formation of an electrical double layer-a region of net charges near the wall. We analyze the spatial distribution of pressure and wall shear stress for a continuous wave train and single pulse peristaltic wave in the presence of an electrical (electroosmotic) body force, which acts on the net charges in the electrical double layer. We then analyze the effect of the electroosmotic body force on the particle reflux as elucidated through the net displacement of neutrally buoyant particles in the flow as the peristaltic waves progress. The impact of combined electroosmosis and peristalsis on trapping of a fluid volume (e.g., bolus) inside the travelling wave is also discussed. The present analysis goes beyond the traditional analysis, which neglects the possibility of coupling the net pumping of fluids due to peristalsis and allows us to derive general expressions for the pressure drop and flow rate in order to set up a general framework for incorporating flow control and actuation by simultaneous peristalsis and application of electric fields to aqueous solutions. It is envisaged that the results presented here may act as a model for the design of lab-on-a-chip devices. © 2016 Author(s).},

abstract={The present trend of increasing the penetration levels of Distributed Generator (DG) in the distribution network has made the issue of Islanding crucial for the reliable operation of the network. The islanding, if not detected early may lead to the collapse of the system as it can drive the distribution system to the cascaded failure. In this paper, an extensive study of the effect of DG placement and sizing is performed by dividing the system into different zones to obtain a reduced effect of islanding. The siting and sizing of DG is carried out to improve the overall voltage profile or/and reduction in active power loss using two stage Genetic Algorithm (GA). In the first stage a basic knockout selection is considered and the best population is taken for next stage, where roulette selection for crossover and mutation is performed for optimal placement and sizing of DGs. The effect of the islanding, due to load variations is reduced by optimal siting and sizing of DG. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is tested on the IEEE 33 and 69 radial bus systems and the results obtained are promising. © The Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers.},

Different concrete mixes, prepared for three water-cement ratios and 5 jarosite replacement levels. One fourth of cement has been replaced by fly ash in all the concrete mixtures. When compared to the control mixes, encouraging results were obtained in the tests to determine the mechanical properties of the concrete containing jarosite. The other important aspect of concrete i.e. durability has been revealed as satisfactory. The leaching of jarosite in concrete mixtures has been observed within the permissible limits of United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). The addition of jarosite as a partial sand replacement in concrete (along with fly ash as mineral admixture) up to 25% could be a new alternative feasible solution to its disposal issue. Also, the concrete with 15% jarosite as a sand replacement could be best suited for road and building construction purpose. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={We present seasonal rock magnetic data for 48 surficial soil samples collected seasonally around a coal-fired thermal power plant on the southwest coast of India to demonstrate how fly ash from the power plant is transported both spatially and seasonally. Sampling was carried out during pre-monsoon (March), early-monsoon (June), monsoon (September) and post-monsoon (December) seasons. Low- and high-frequency magnetic susceptibility (χlf and χhf), frequency-dependent magnetic susceptibility (χfd), χfd %, isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM), “hard” IRM (HIRM), saturation IRM (SIRM) and inter-parametric ratios were determined for the samples. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used on limited number of samples. NOAA HYSPLIT MODEL backward trajectory analysis and principal component analysis were carried out on the data. Fly ash samples exhibit an average HIRM value (400.07 × 10−5 Am2 kg−1) that is comparable to that of soil samples. The pre- and post-monsoon samples show a consistent reduction in the concentration of magnetically “hard” minerals with increasing distance from the power plant. These data suggest that fly ash has indeed been transported from the power plant to the sampling locations. Hence, HIRM may perhaps be used as a proxy for tracking fly ash from coal-fired thermal power plants. Seasonal data show that the distribution of fly ash to the surrounding areas is minimum during monsoons. They also point to the dominance of SP magnetite in early-monsoon season, whereas magnetic depletion is documented in the monsoon season. This seasonal difference is attributable to both pedogenesis and anthropogenic activity i.e. operation of the thermal power plant. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract={Jarosite, one of the by-product of zinc manufacturing industry has been of a major concern in this context because of its hazardous nature. The present study aims to assess the durability of cement concrete containing jarosite. Fine aggregates have been replaced by jarosite in different percentages. Equivalent volume of 25% cement has also been replaced by fly ash. Durability parameters like chloride diffusion and corrosion in jarosite were determined. Keeping the environmental suitability of concrete in mind, toxicity leaching characteristic potential test has been performed on raw jarosite and concrete samples. It was observed that the chloride diffusion in concrete and corrosion of reinforcement in jarosite added concrete has been less than control mixtures. The satisfactory performance of durability properties has been validated with the Scanning Electron Microscopy images and X-ray diffraction. © 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={In this paper three types of carbon nanotubes, namely, zigzag (n, 0), armchair (n= m), and chiral (n, m) are investigated with and without doping using simulation technique. The electronic properties like band structure and density of states of these three configurations with different values of n and m vectors are analysed and compared using Atomistix Toolkit (ATK) software. When the band structures of the designed configurations, reported in this paper are compared, it is observed that when the value of (n-m) vector is divisible by three, the CNTs behave as metals, otherwise they behave as semiconductors. The density of states of carbon nanotubes depicts the energy gap around the Fermi level. For the tube with chiral chirality, density of states is zero near the Fermi level, for semiconductor behaviour there is small gap in density of states near Fermi level and gap increases as the behaviour changes to insulator. © 2016 Author(s).},

abstract={Nanoalloy clusters formed between Au and Si are topics of great interest today from both scientific and technological point of view. Due to its remarkable catalytic, electronic, mechanical and magnetic properties Au-Si nanoalloy clusters have extensive applications in the field of microelectronics, catalysis, biomedicine, and jewelry industry. Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a new paradigm of quantum mechanics, which is very much popular to study the electronic properties of materials. Conceptual DFT based descriptors have been invoked to correlate the experimental properties of nanoalloy clusters. In this venture, we have systematically investigated AuSin (n=1-9) nanoalloy clusters in the theoretical frame of the B3LYP exchange correlation. The experimental properties of AuSin (n=1-9) nanoalloy clusters are correlated in terms of DFT based descriptors viz. HOMO-LUMO gap, Electronegativity (χ), Global Hardness (η), Global Softness (S) and Electrophilicity Index (ω). The calculated HOMO-LUMO gap exhibits interesting odd-even alteration behaviour, indicating that even numbered clusters possess higher stability as compare to their neighbour odd numbered clusters. This study also reflects a very well agreement between experimental bond length and computed data. © 2016 Author(s).},

abstract={We analyze the electrokinetic transport of aqueous electrolyte fluids with Newtonian model in presence of peristalsis through microchannel. Debye-Hückel linearization is employed to simplify the problem. Low Reynolds number and large wavelength approximations are taken into account subjected to microfluidics applications. Electrical double layer (EDL) is considered very thin and electroosmotic slip velocity (i.e. Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity) at the wall is subjected to study the effect of applied electrical field. The solutions for axial velocity and pressure difference along the channel length are obtained analytically and the effects of adding and opposing the flow by applied electric field have been discussed. It is revealed that the axial velocity and pressure gradient enhances with adding electric field and an opposite behavior is found in the flow direction on opposing the electric field. These results may also help towards designing organ-on-a-chip like devices for better drug design. © 2016 Author(s).},

abstract={Recent studies on the potential toxicity of High Aspect Ratio Nanoparticles (HARN) has yet once again reinforced the health hazard imposed by asbestos fibres ranging from nano to micro size. Asbestos a naturally occurring fibrous mineral declared a Group I definite carcinogen by IARC (International Agency for Research on Cancer), a unit of WHO in the year 1987, has been extensively used since World War II to the near past for various commercial products. According to the most recent World Health Organization (WHO) estimates, asbestos-related diseases, resulting from exposure at workplace claims more than 107000 lives every year worldwide. The various types of toxic effects induced by asbestos in humans include - i) inflammation and fibrogenesis of lung, ii) mesothelioma iii) asbestosis and iv) bronchogenic carcinoma. The stability of asbestos in natural environment and its biological aggressiveness is related to their fibrous structure and dimensions. The actual risk associated with the exposure to nanosized asbestos, which is still unknown and escapes most regulations worldwide, has been shown in various toxicity assessment studies conducted on various animal models.In an effort to reduce the size of asbestos and therby its toxicity by limiting its biopersistence, oxalic acid treatment of asbestos coupled to power ultrasound treatment was carried out. The nanosized particles formed were still found to retain their hazardous effect. Similar were the results obtained on strong acid treatment of asbestos as well. A probable solution to the asbestos toxicity problem therefore envisaged was bioremediation. This involved the secretion of iron chelating molecules termed siderophores by microbes, which are of significance due to their ability to form very stable and soluble complexes with iron. Iron in asbestos composition is a major factor responsible for its carcinogenicity, removal or extraction of which would prove to be an effective answer to the worldwide problem. Siderophores are low molecular weight organic compounds with a very high and specific affinity to chelate iron and enhance their diffusion to the microbial cell surface. A number of successful experiments carried out in vitro have shown positive results concerning reduction in asbestos toxicity on chelation of iron by siderophores. The present investigation tends to put forth the aspect of these biomolecules secreted by specific bacteria and fungi as potent tools to fight the micro to nano sized asbestos fibre toxicity. © 2016 Author(s).},

Disentanglement of the carbon nanotube, resulted in exposing the defective sites on the surface and breaking of weak bonds, which assisted in creating the new defects on the surface.

abstract={Discovery of porous silicon formation in silicon substrate in 1956 while electro-polishing crystalline Si in hydrofluoric acid (HF), has triggered large scale investigations of porous silicon formation and their changes in physical and chemical properties with thermal and chemical treatment. A nitrogen sorption study is used to investigate the effect of thermal annealing on electrochemically etched mesoporous silicon (PS). The PS was thermally annealed from 200°C to 800°C for 1 hr in the presence of air. It was shown that the pore diameter and porosity of PS vary with annealing temperature. The experimentally obtained adsorption / desorption isotherms show hysteresis typical for capillary condensation in porous materials. A simulation study based on Saam and Cole model was performed and compared with experimentally observed sorption isotherms to study the physics behind of hysteresis formation. We discuss the shape of the hysteresis loops in the framework of the morphology of the layers. The different behavior of adsorption and desorption of nitrogen in PS with pore diameter was discussed in terms of concave menisci formation inside the pore space, which was shown to related with the induced pressure in varying the pore diameter from 7.2 nm to 3.4 nm. © 2016 Author(s).},

abstract={This paper presents the design of a Memristor based startup circuit for self biased circuits. Memristor has many advantages over conventional CMOS devices such as low leakage current at nanometer scale, easy to manufacture. In this work the switching characteristics of memristor is utilized. First the theoretical equations describing the switching behavior of memristor are investigated. To prove the switching capability of Memristor, a startup circuit based on memristor is proposed which uses series combination of Memristor and capacitor. Proposed circuit is compared with the previously reported MOSFET based startup circuits. Comparison of different circuits was done to validate the results. Simulation results show that memristor based circuit can attain on (I = 12.94 μA) to off state (I = 1.2 μA) in 25 ns while the MOSFET based startup circuits take on (I = 14.19 μA) to off state (I = 1.4 μA) in more than 90 ns. The benefit comes in terms of area because the number of components used in the circuit are lesser than the conventional startup circuits. © 2016 Author(s).},

abstract={ZnO nanoparticles synthesis was carried out by Sol–Gel wet chemical precipitation route. The crystallinity and the structure of ZnO was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern. The pattern gets indexed in wurtzite (hexagonal) structure with lattice constants a = b = 3_2606 Å and c = 5.2214 Å and confirms the single phase material with no impurity. The particle size in the sample is estimated using Debye Scherer’s (DS) formula lie in the range from 40 nm to 55 nm for three major planes, indicating the nano-crystalline nature of the sample. X-ray peak broadening analysis was used to evaluate the crystallite sizes and lattice strain by the Williamson–Hall analysis. The morphological analysis of the sample was carried out by Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The observed size of ZnO nanoparticles by TEM micrograph exhibits the similar trend with the size calculated by Debye-Scherer formula. TEM image shows the irregular shape of the nanoparticles and particle size lies in the range of 20–60 nm. Similar to SEM image, the agglomeration of the nanoparticles have been observed from TEM. The magnetization measurement of ZnO was carried out by SQUID Magnetometer. M–H measurement shows diamagnetic behavior at 300 K and weak ferromagnetic behavior at 5 K. © 2016 American Scientific Publishers. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The integration of Distributed Generation (DG) into distribution networks is associated with large practical problems. With the large variation in load demand and the high penetration level of these distributed energy resources, the voltage stability issue has become a prime concern for the system operator. This paper proposes an optimal voltage control method for regulating the voltage of LV distribution network with DGs whenever the voltage at any bus exceeds normal operating limits. The algorithm is based on the voltage sensitivities to active and reactive power. The voltage regulation is achieved by power output management of DGs with re-dispatching their power outputs using Nonlinear Programming (NLP) optimization technique. The algorithm is tested on standard IEEE-33 bus radial distribution system and the result obtained shows the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={The islanding issue in the distribution system poses great threat to the system during operation. With increased penetration levels of DG, the system is more vulnerable to islanding, leading to the collapse of the system. This paper proposes an improved method to detect the islanding in the system with DG penetration. The proposed work is a two-step method, firstly the siting and sizing of DG is obtained by two stage Genetic Algorithm (GA) to improve the voltage profile and to reduce the active power losses. A two stage GA ensures a faster convergence and better quality of solutions. Finally the proposed improved hybrid method is applied to detect the bus most susceptible for islanding under varying operating conditions. The improved hybrid islanding detection method utilizes the positive features of existing active and passive methods simultaneously. The proposed work is tested on IEEE 33 and 69 bus radial systems and the results obtained are promising. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Virtual ground voltage (Vgnd) has been used for fine grained optimization of power gated digital circuits. In this paper, we analyze the potential sources of error in dynamic characteristics of Vgnd due to inaccurate models as well as under-estimation of input voltages of CMOS gates in logic circuits. We propose a piecewise simulation based model for dynamic Vgnd estimation, which further needs capacitance models to be characterized at V gnd node. These capacitance models are used in conjunction with leakage current models to develop dynamic Vgnd model. Average error of less than 0.5% compared to 4.2% of previously reported models is achieved when compared to HSPICE results on ISCAS'85 benchmark circuits. On an average, our proposed model is 30 × efficient than HSPICE for dynamic V gnd estimation during mode transition. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={In order to implement Sequential Bayesian estimator using Monte carlo simulation and to get rid of limitations of Kalman filter, Particle filtering techniques plays a very crucial role for target tracking applications in state space where Importance sampling approximately distributed by posterior distribution with multimodel feature and robustness to noise. However as the particles becomes very large, the Monte carlo representation becomes nearly equivalent to analytical description characterization for posterior distributions and has some deficiencies such as high computational cost and low sampling efficiency. Therefore, emerging computing platform, cuda may be regarded as most appealing platform for such implementaion. Representation provided with set of samples for target distribution of state leads to increase in sampling efficiency so that graphics processing unit (GPUPU) becomes more appealing to use in Particle filter. The modification on mapping architecture are evaluated with qualitative analysis. The proposed design will be 3.5 times faster than direct design. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents a simple and an efficient approach for load flow analysis of a radial distribution network by using parallel computation. By introducing CUDA (Computationally Unified Device Architecture), a platform is provided for performing the parallel implementation of the analysis.The analysis starts by determining the order of the nodes present in the distribution network. To generate the order of the nodes, Breadth First Search is used in parallel. Further, the current and the voltages present at each node of the network are evaluated. This procedure is repeated till the convergence criterion is achieved. CUDA provides an efficient utilization of the computational power of GPU, by which the performance and throughput of sequential load flow algorithm, has been enhanced dramatically. With the immense support of many GPUs, CUDA helps load flow analysis to efficiently manage and manipulate a large blocks of data of the distribution networks. Moreover there has been a lot of reduction in the execution steps as compared to the serial computing. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={The present study describes surface modification of leather using environment friendly atmospheric pressure dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) process to improve dyeing with natural dyes. Leather samples were exposed to dielectric barrier discharge produced in air. DBD plasma treatment changes morphology and chemical composition of the surface of leather samples. The chemical changes at leather surface are confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. The morphology and chemical composition of leather surface is studied using scanning electron microscope and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. We observed significant improvement in dye uptake properties after air plasma treatment. Different species formed in plasma are identified using optical emission spectroscopy. Untreated and plasma treated samples were dyed with Eco-Garnet Brown, Eco-Hill Brown III, Eco-Turkey Red and Eco-Smoke Grey natural dyes. Dyeing behavior was assessed by spectroscopic measurement and by measuring fastness (wash and rub) properties. This has clearly indicated an increase in color intensity of plasma exposed leather as well as an increase in the dye uptake as compared to the untreated leather. Best results were obtained with Eco-Hill Brown III and Eco-Smoke Grey dyes. The study reveals that atmospheric pressure plasma has potential to become dry and eco-friendly process to modify leather surface to improve dye uptake properties with natural dyes. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={This paper explores the impact of high power factor (HPF) on the life of self-ballasted lamps or commonly referred as CFLs. In HPF CFLs the lamp current crest factor is usually very high. From the research work done so far it is well understood that the high current crest factor is detrimental for the life of lamp electrodes. The work done in this paper provides information about the filament current crest factor with corresponding change in electrode temperature. The lamps used for these experiment are switched on and off with sufficient time given to cool the lamp electrodes. The degradation of the lamp life with respect to filament current crest factor and electrode temperature are plotted and analysed. The best fit is obtained for the set of experiments conducted. From the set of results obtained a mathematical equation is derived. This work serves an important aspect of HPF circuitry and their corresponding drawback in addressing lifetime issues of CFLs. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Influence of ionization is studied on two stream instability (TSI) in an inhomogeneous plasma in the presence of obliquely applied magnetic field. In addition to the usual TSI, a new type of instability is found to occur in this system, which is driven by the magnetic field and survives for relatively longer wavelength of oscillations. The growth rates of both the instabilities are enhanced by the magnetic field but their magnitudes attain a minimum value at certain angles of the wave propagation depending upon the wavelength of oscillations. At a critical value of ionization rate there is a sudden fall in the growth of both the instabilities, the reason of which is understood as the Landau damping. A further enhancement in the ionization suppresses the usual TSI whereas the magnetic field-driven instability attains much lower growth. This new type of instability grows faster in the plasma having heavier ions, but shows a weak dependence on the charge of the ions. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.},

abstract={The science of Geomicrobiology. , which deals with mineral- microbe interaction in nature contributes effectively to three important processes namely- mineral and metal bioremediation, biomining and soil mineral formation by microbes. Bioremediation one of the important process of the above, degrades or transforms hazardous contaminants to less toxic compounds. Several groups of fungi have proved highly efficient in this aspect, with asbestos being one such toxic entity in the environment on which their activity was studied. The present investigation uses the same tool as a device for detoxifying asbestos, a potent carcinogenic entity; with fungal isolates native to the asbestos mines of Rajasthan, India, being investigated for the first time. The cellular mechanism of asbestos toxicity is mainly attributed to the presence of iron in its chemical composition which catalyzes generation of free radicals leading to oxidation of biomolecules. The two dominant novel species found therein, identified as Aspergillus tubingenesis and Coemansia reversa have proved capable of actively removing iron from asbestos fibers as studied by scanning electron microscopy- electron diffraction X-ray (SEM-EDX) analysis. This probably could lead to a reduction in toxicity of asbestos, due to reduced iron concentration as reported in related studies. Many fungi are known to release iron chelating compounds, siderophores, which could be instrumental in the study. The findings related to two new fungal species being added to the list of earlier identified fungal bioremediators of asbestos, widens the prospect of using bioremediation as an effective tool for asbestos detoxification. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is used as classifier for predicting the transient instability status of the system with rotor angles and speeds (frequency) of generator as inputs at different consecutive cycle lengths after fault clearing. The stability status obtained from ANN can be utilized for initiating the emergency control actions within few cycles from fault clearing. The proposed scheme is able to successfully predict the transient stability status of the system for unseen operating conditions with varying topology.

abstract={Background: Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) consist of sensor nodes which are able to sense a variety of physical phenomenon. It is a well-known fact that in most of the real world applications related to WSNs, the deployment is random as manual deployment is not possible due to harsh environments and other complexities. Therefore, there is no prior knowledge about the position of the sensor nodes that are deployed to form a wireless sensor network. In order to overcome this aspect related to position estimate of sensor nodes various localization schemes and algorithms have been proposed. The schemes and algorithms proposed so far also offer advantages like optimal routing, energy conservation, security, topology control besides providing the accurate position estimation of deployed sensor nodes. This paper explicitly presents a survey on the existing learning and non-learning based algorithms that have special role in localization of sensor nodes for WSNs. Methods: Comparative analysis of prominent learning and non-learning based algorithms. The analysis is based in terms of physical measurement, accuracy, computation and hardware cost and energy efficiency. Result: Detailed reporting of learning and non-learning based algorithms with their sub-categories. The study and survey of various algorithms throw light on their applicability and use for WSNs. Conclusion: Characteristics exhibited by the variants of the discussed algorithms are featured in order to make them application centric and cost effective. © 2016 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={Load flow analysis of electrical distribution networks either for providing household electricity or in integrated circuits has always been a topic of great interest for researchers from last few decades.

The paper mainly focusses on these techniques at a single site and the enhancements made to the already existing techniques throughout the use of GPU architecture using CUDA platform in lieu of enhancing the performance of already existing solution with respect to time and algorithmic complexity. The paper also explains the need of enhancing prevailing solutions for load flow analysis for future generation smart grids or real time systems by comparing the performance with serial version for different topologies of network. Further the paper also throws light on some of the network reconfiguration techniques used to remodel the RDN due to high power losses in the network and floats an idea how parallel processing can be beneficial in enhancing already existing genetic algorithm based network reconfiguration technique to support real time load flow calculations and topology construction in smart grids and future generation systems. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Background: The fast emerging Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and its growing demand in each and every sphere of our lives has shifted our focus on the performance of the networks involved in varied fields. Recent studies depict that the performance of network and its utilization can be enhanced by QoS (Quality of Service) routing protocol. Thus, QoS is the essence of the WSNs. So, in this paper, we would like to present a detailed survey of the various routing protocols which play a vital role in attaining the QoS in WSNs. Methods: There are various levels of QoS which are required by the WSNs depending on the applications that they focus upon. The QoS support to WSNs can be achieved by various routing protocols. Thus, a detailed research on various routing protocols is done depicting their strengths and weakness and a comparison table of various protocols on various parameters is provided. Results: The QoS basically aims to focus on the quality that is perceived by the users of various applications. The QoS facilitates the above aim in terms of delay, packet delivery ratio, reduction in power of the sensor nodes, energy efficiency, bandwidth utilization, amount of through put generated and many other factors. However, there are few challenges faced by QoS which may occur due to dynamic topology and constrained resources. Even after these challenges the research suggests QoS is undisputedly the essence of WSNs. Conclusion: The QoS is very advantageous as it helps in improving the service provided to the users, and is accountable in improving the quality of output perceived by the users of various applications. Researchers have started working to overcome the challenges of QoS with the aim to minimize its constraints and maximize its multiple objectives. © 2016 Bentham Science Publishers.},

Aadhar has not only helped in better identification of Indians but it has also lead them to reap enormous benefits of various government grants as well as subsidies, including the LPG subsidies as well as the scholarships intended for the meritorious students. This number carries various positive implications with itself. At the same time it also suffers from certain shortcomings of the likes of security concerns. This paper aims to assess and analyse the financial aspect of Aadhar/UID. The area under purview here is that of seeding the Aadhar with bank accounts of individuals in India. An assessment has been undertaken of the extent to which individuals feel to be benefitted out of this linkage. The results depict that the people consider this linkage as an effective tool for better identification of an individual. The paper might rightly be called as reality check into the enormous e- governance initiative being undertaken in India. © 2016, Serials Publications. All rights reserved.},

The use of non-identical unit's redundant systems is preferred in industries but due to lack of proper maintenance and repair they results in decline of productivity. Hence, to enhance the reliability and productivity, beneficial initiative must be taken. For this purpose, a reliability model of a redundant system having one original and one duplicate unit is developed with an immediate repair facility. Repairman conducts the preventive maintenance of the unit after a pre-specific time to enhance the performance and efficiency of the system. All random variables follow Weibull distribution. Mean time to system failure, availability and profit function has been derived for the considered non-identical redundant system. To highlight the importance of the study graphs are drawn for these measures.},

abstract={In the era of Liberalization, the banking sector has grown extremely but still money lenders in rural areas are continuously taking advantage of the poor section. Over the years there have been many schemes that had been taken up by the RBI and the government to take forward the financial inclusion process in India. Financial inclusion is a new concept which enables the alternative techniques to promote the banking habits and acts as enabler in reducing the poverty. The main objective of financial inclusion is to connect all individualwith banking system. This connection will lead to uplift their standard of living and overall development of the economy. The current government in the last year came up with extremelymotivated project, the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) in August 2015. The prime objective of the PMJDY is to ensure financial inclusion of the poor and rural population by giving them selfesteem, financial liberty and financial constancy. This scheme is a national mission on financial inclusion. It has the objective of covering all households in the country having a bank account and other banking facilities.This paper focusesthe evaluation of this scheme with reference to rural people of Bagru village of Jaipur City in Rajasthan.

abstract={Education is one of the key aspects in the present century. It's almost fifteen years into the 21st Century, many universities around the world are trying new ways of teaching and learning and coping to find the new evaluation patterns in the classroom teaching. In the 21st century technology plays a significant role in changing the classroom environment. Many New Media Technologies were introduced by teachers to make the classroom more interactive and collaborative. This change has also been there for years in many universities around the world. Many universities in India are also a part of this pedagogy shift. Many universities are adapting new methods, processes and products to identify educational goals. The use of New Media Technologies, classrooms is becoming knowledge delivery centers and classrooms are expanding by themselves. Students can learn, interact and share the knowledge anywhere in the world. These technologies allow teachers to keep track on the student progress on time from anywhere. The technologies encourage peer to peer learning and collaborative research and also increase the teacher - student relationship. Teaching and learning through new media technologies helps to diversify the learner's need and provide a teacher student collaborative learning environment. This research paper deals with the awareness of the different New Media Technologies used in the classroom teaching among students in Jaipur Region India.

abstract={Objectives of the Study: The purpose of this paper is to examine the role of financial literacy in the realization of financial inclusion in India. If we analyze the financial inclusion, we will found that achieving the financial inclusion is based on two pillars - demand side and supply side. Where availability of the financial products in the market is very important, equally important is the fact that people are aware of them and they are in a situation to demand those products. In this context, financial literacy among the masses is very important, so that people have the awareness about the financial climate and financial products. This will increase their capability to demand for the financial products. This way, it can achieve the target of financial inclusion. Research Methodology: The research work is based on the secondary data. These data are obtained fromRBI publications, research papers and text books. It also uses secondary data from various other sources- newspapers, journals and periodicals like Economic Times, Business Line, Micro-Finance world etc. The study is designed as follows: In section-1 we introduce the concept of financial inclusion. An attempt is made to understand meaning, role and importance of financial inclusion. Section-2 will describe the link between financial inclusion and financial literacy and the various facets of it. In section-3 we provide our conclusions and some suggestions. Findings: Financial inclusion is an attempt to achieve the ultimate objective i.e. inclusive growth. Financial inclusion is an important constituent of this, because a financially deprivement is a very big deterrent of a person's overall development. Our study reveals that the final answer of financial inclusion rests on both sides-demand side and supply side. It is now, becoming increasingly apparent that addressing the problem of financial exclusion will require a holistic approach in creating awareness about not only on credit management but on financial products, education, debt counseling, savings and advice on money management. Significance of the Work: The research work addresses important aspects like financial awareness, education, debt counseling, etcwhich can contribute to attain our goal of financial inclusion.},

abstract={Purpose: The research paper aims at studying the various factors affecting consumer's online purchase attitude and the relative importance of these factors in determining consumer's online purchase attitude. Additionally the study focusses on examining the effect of consumer's online purchase attitude on their purchase intention. Design/Methodology/Approach: An empirical study was conducted where 100 individuals responded towards the questionnaire. The study examines that how an individual's perception differs from each other on the different factors affecting their purchase attitude which will determine their online purchase intention. Findings:The proposed framework explains the 64% of the total variance in purchase attitude affected by some identified factors in online shopping. Out of these major identified factors six factors were proven to have a significant effect on the purchase attitude i.e. risk of identity theft, risk of losing privacy, trustworthiness of the vendor, past purchase experience and time taken to deliver the products whereas the remaining three factors were proven to have no significant effect on the purchase attitude i.e. product return policy, time taken to access web page and information on FAQ's and complaint resolution.Additionally As a result the literature support the positive relationship betweenattitude and online purchase intention. Research Limitations/Implications:The study was limited to the population of two cities of Rajasthan i.e. Ajmer and Jaipur taking small sample into consideration. Additionally the study could cover only 64% of variability in the online purchase intention due to the discussed factors. Practical Implications:The study contributes towards the development of the various ecommerce models and helps the various e-commerce companies as well as the online vendors to understand the different factors affecting online purchase intention due to differences in attitude which will increase their revenue and improve upon their strategies. Social implications: The study will benefit the society by providing the various critical factors affecting an individual's online purchase intention to be considered while shopping online and would create more awareness among them about purchasing over the internet. Originality/value:The study covers the population of Ajmer and Jaipur city of Rajasthan where no such studies have been done ever before.},

abstract={Achieving expected level of Quality-of-experience (QoE) at receiving end during real-time video streaming is a challenging task in inherently error-prone multihop mobile ad hoc network (MANET). Continuously fluctuating link conditions, dynamicity in bit rates of transmitted video and topology change due to node mobility are some major issues in providing required QoE to multimedia traffic in MANETs. In this paper, we propose a reactive Link Stability Based Routing (LSBR) protocol. LSBR discover route consisting of links having high lifetime. The stability of a link is estimated dynamically during the route dis covery process using its signal strength and interference along with the relative mobility of nodes forming the link. A multi-metric mathematical model has been developed using the aforementioned parameters to select a link from the candidate links at each intermediate node in such a way that leads to selection of high lifetime route. To prove effectiveness of LSBR protocol for real-life video streaming, a hybrid MANET scenario consisted of simulated nodes and physical machines is designed using an industry standard emulation tool called EXata-Cyber. Correctness of LSBR protocol for video streaming is established by simulation, hybrid testbed as well as users’ experience. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

abstract={This paper presents a review study on binarization of gray images. Binarization is a technique by which an image is converted into bits. It is an important step in most document image analysis systems. Since a digital image is a set of pixels. Many binarization techniques have a definite intensity value for each pixel. A gray image is just an image which has each pixel of same intensity. That means there is not much difference in color or value information of pixels. Usually, a picture in black and white is considered as gray image in which black has least intensity and white have highest. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2016.},

abstract={Due to diverse applications in the field of science and engineering, the clusters formed between Gold and Silicon are attractive building blocks for future nano-scale and optical devices. It has remarkable catalytic, electronic, optical and magnetic properties. A number of experimental as well as theoretical researchers are actively involved into this research domain. Theoretical approach is very popular in terms of Density Functional Theory (DFT) to compute the electronic structure of matter. Conceptual DFT based descriptors have been invoked to correlate the experimental properties of nano compounds and composites. In this report, we have studied AunSi (n=1-8) nano alloy clusters. Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) with basis set LanL2DZ have been used in this analysis. The experimental properties of the AunSi (n=1-8) nanoalloy clusters are correlated in terms of DFT based descriptors viz. HOMO-LUMO gap (eV), Electronegativity (χ), Global Hardness (η), Global Softness (S) and Electrophilicity Index (ω). The calculated HOMO-LUMO gap exhibits interesting odd-even oscillation behaviour, indicating that even numbered clusters possess higher stability in comparison with odd numbered clusters. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Virtualization is a component of cloud computing. Virtualization does the key role on resource (e.g., storage, network, and compute) management and utilized the resource by isolated virtual machines (VMs). A good VMs migration system has an impact on energy efficiency policy. Good resource administration policy monitors the on-demand load management, and also manages the allocation/relocation of the VMs. The key challenges are VMs isolation and migration in heterogeneous physical servers. Threshold mechanism is effective to manage the load among VMs. Previous research shows thrashing is a good option to manage load and migrate the load among VMs during failover and high load. Linear programming (LP), static and dynamic approaches are superior to manage the load through VMs migration. This research proposes threshold-based LP approach to manage load balance and focus on dynamic resource management, load balance goals, and load management challenges. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2016.},

abstract={This paper has been proposed to present a simple approach for load flow analysis of a radial distribution network using parallel programming in Computationally Unified Device Architecture (CUDA). The proposed approach applies Breadth First Search to evaluate the nodes in the network and Kirchhoff’s current law (KCL) as well as Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL) for evaluating the current and voltages at each of the network nodes. The procedure is repeated till the convergence criterion is achieved. The paper demonstrates the working of Breadth First Search using CUDA. The efficiency of load flow algorithm has been enhanced by utilizing parallel computational power of Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). This approach has been tested for 33-nodes as well as for 69-nodes radial distribution systems and comparison has been done between the performances of sequential approach over CPU and parallel approach on GPU. The results show that introducing CUDA to load flow analysis speeds up the performance of the system by faster executions and gives accurate desired results as compared to sequential approach. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2016.},

abstract={Anomaly exposure is a grave concern in network intrusion classification (IDS). Furthermost anomaly based IDSs employ supervised procedures, whose enactments extremely be contingent on attack-free training statistics. Nonetheless, this generous of training data is problematic to acquire in real-world network environment. Additionally, with fluctuating network setting or services, patterns of typical traffic will be reformed. This leads to high false-positive rate of supervised IDSs. Real-time detection is one of the most imperative issues in intrusion detection. When the network data is becoming enormous with high dimensionality, real-time detection with high detection accuracy and low false alarm rate is challenging for previous methods. The vertical progression in data volume and Hadoop cluster extent make it a momentous encounter to diagnose and localize problems in a production-level cluster setting competently and within a petite epoch of time. Frequently, the disseminated monitoring schemes are not accomplished of perceiving a problem thriving in earlier when a comprehensive Hadoop cluster twitches to depreciate in enactment or becomes unattainable. This research exertion proposed an unsupervised outlier detection based on fuzzy-based model also with typically K-means clustering algorithm and categorize different types of anomaly which can overwhelmed the downsides of supervised incongruity detection.

abstract={The population of India has rapidly increased from 68.33 million to 121.01 million from 1981 to 2011, respectively. It is estimated that by the year 2028 India will hold the largest population of the world. The prompt upsurge of the Indian population will force people to migrate from the rural area to the mega cities, to avail basic amenities. The enormous migration will increase the demand for more space to live in mega cities and will lead to a situation of unauthorized, unplanned, uncoordinated, and uncontrolled growth, and this condition called as urban sprawl. The key challenge for a planner is to achieve sustainable development and to predict the future urban sprawl in the city. Unfortunately, conventional techniques that predict urban sprawl are expensive and time consuming. In this paper, we have proposed a novel technique to predict the future urban sprawl. We have used an integrated approach of Remote Sensing, GIS, and Multilayer perceptron to predict the future urban sprawl for the city Jaipur up to 2021. We have compared our results with existing techniques like Linear Regression and Gaussian Process and found that the Multilayer perceptron gives better results than other existing techniques. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

abstract={The main task for the software management is to predict the reliability of a software by using an appropriate software reliability growth model (SRGM). The accuracy of the mechanism adopted for reliability prediction is also an important factor. In this study, a software reliability growth modelling problem has been solved using artificial neural networks (ANNs), as ANNs based models are competitive with traditional statistical models for software testing effort estimation. In the first phase, a software reliability growth model has been proposed with compounded decreased error rate to predict the software reliability. The model is further extended by incorporating Cobb-Douglas production function to model the combined effect of time and resources used. Multi-layer feed-forward neural network is used to solve the problems. The weights associated with various input parameters are updated using generalised delta rule and Levenberg-Marquardt method. A comparison is then made with the results from existing models in the literature. The work is validated by using two famous real data sets. Numerical results show that the proposed models perform better in comparison to others existing in the literature. Copyright © 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

The governing equations of fluid flow have been solved using regular perturbation technique. This is observed that the small values of the Peclet number increase the thermal conductivity of the fluid and therefore, the heat is able to diffuse away from the heated surface more rapidly. Moreover, an increase in the thermal radiation leads to props up the fluid temperature within the boundary layer. Further, the non-dimensional shearing stress and the rate of heat transfer in terms of the Nusselt number at the walls of channel are also obtained. © 2016 Institute of Thermomechanics CAS, v.v.i.},

abstract={Difficult geographies and high mobile penetration were seen as extremely potential for shifting focus from e-governance to m-governance in India. M-governance program 'm-Sewa' was implemented in 2012. However, success of m-Sewa project depends on adoption and implementation by different State governments. A few Indian states have created comprehensive service delivery platform, integrated with their e-governance infrastructure. On the other hand, a few other states are just beginning the journey; while some other states are years behind. This paper attempts to make a comparative study of the m-government projects undertaken by different states of India as the mode to offer various government department services accessible to the citizens through mobile phones. The paper also attempts to evaluate the implementations as per elaboration likelihood model (ELM) framework. This paper will help the policy makers to decide the implementation strategy and kind of services to offer to maximise the adoption by users. Copyright © 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={Gear system is one of the most important components in any mechanical power transmission system. A gear pair in action is generally subjected to contact loading at the mating surface. In this paper, the stresses due to contact loading have been evaluated on the surface of gear tooth and along the gear tooth depth. The spur gear was considered for this study for two different loading conditions, torques of 150 Nm and 200 Nm. The involute profile of the spur gear was generated using an ANSYS APDL program prior to spur gear model development. The finite element analysis was carried out using ANSYS 15. The Finite Element Method (FEM) was comparatively an easy and accurate technique for analysing the nonlinear gear contact stresses. Frictional coefficients ranging from 0.0 until 0.3 were selected and the corresponding contact stresses were found to be directly proportional to the friction coefficients. A governing equation for the relationship between the dimensionless contact stress values and gear tooth depth ratios for varying friction coefficients was established. The results showed that the maximum stress was located beneath the surface of the gear tooth in contact for low friction coefficient values, μ < 0.23. The stress trend remains the same for μ > 0.23 but the surface stress becomes greater than the stresses beneath the surface. Furthermore, the position of maximum stress along the depth of contact was unchanged regardless of the amount of torque applied and frictional coefficient values. ©2006-2016 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).},

abstract={The screen adaptation of the novella Devdas by Saratchandra Chattopadhyay is an important landmark in early Indian cinema. A prominent film, screened in four Indian languages (Bengali, Hindi, Telugu and Tamil), it seems to offer a novel vision of romantic love and romanticism. This article critiques the fanciful interpretations of the film provided by some postmodern academics in the field of comparative literature. It endeavours to place the film both as text and cinematic work into a broader perspective based on the study of intertextuality of three renditions: Raghavaiah's Devdas (Telugu, 1953), Bimal Roy's Devdas (Hindi, 1955) and Bhansali's Devdas (Hindi, 2002). Grounded in cultural theory and Indian performative aesthetics coupled with moving image analysis, this study highlights the underlying, deep-rooted romanticism embedded in Indian philosophical and aesthetic traditions of devotion between atma (individual soul) and paramatma (absolute soul), personifying Paro/Chandramukhi as atma and Devdas as paramatma. This article, part of a larger project on de-Westernising media studies, makes a critical intervention in current South Asian Studies by aiming to provide a novel theoretical framework to which the philosophical and traditional tenets grounding the novella of Devdas can be anchored. © 2016, SAGE Publications.

abstract={The world is a competitive arena where survival is dependent on sustainability. Environment has gradually changed and had influenced the sustainable development in the recent past. The changing era of technology has played a vital role in enhancing sustainable development through environmental ecosystem. This paper explores a niche area of environmentally sound technology (EST) to understand the holistic view of sustainable development through the microscope of society in India. This paper aims at exploring the barriers in adoption of EST in rural India and modelling the barriers in a revised unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model. It also projects revision in the model by adding moderating effect of prior experience, gender and age of end users to understand the change in behavioural intention of the user in rural areas. The results reflect difference in behavioural intention and degree of usage for different age groups and gender. The results derived from primary data collection showcase a classified result of barriers clearly justifying the moderating effect by each of the external factors. The revised UTAUT model is one of the few models knit for EST in a rural dynamics like India. © 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

For the Darcian model, the velocity and heat equations are analytically solved and the effects of various physical parameters on thses are discussed. In addition, the Entropy generation rate, Nusselt number and Bejan number are analyzed for different parameters. It was perceived that entropy generation number attains high values due to the thermal radiation. This is also concluded that rate of heat transfer upsurges due to the radiative heat tansfer and Brinkmann number.},

abstract={The impact of ambient temperature rise and, therefore T-point temperature rise too, on the life time of LEDs is analysed in this paper. From the research conducted so far it is understood that life time resource of LEDs is mainly dependent on junction temperature. For most of the high power LEDs, which are enclosed inside a luminaire, dissipation of junction heat from the device is a major concern for most of the manufacturers. In this paper, an attempt has been made to investigate the underlying constraints of heat dissipation and subsequently using LEDs as a general light source. The investigation is carried out in two steps. Firstly, the degradation in light output with corresponding increase in ambient temperature is explored. Secondly, the impact of increase in T-point temperature on the lifetime of the LEDs is observed. The experiment is conducted using high power LEDs and the same is subjected to external thermal stress. The temperature inside the environmental chamber represents the ambient temperature for the LED and thus by gradually increasing the ambient temperature the T-point temperature is also increased. The temperature of the chamber and the T-point are measured by using k-type thermocouple. The corresponding data hence obtained are tabulated and correlated with light output. The results are analysed using statistical tool to obtain the relation between the parameters. © 2016, LLC Editorial of Journal “Light Technik”. All rights reserved.},

In this paper, we propose using texture descriptors extracted from the nucleus image for detection of ALL. The disease causes change in the chromatin distribution of the nucleus, which can be observed in the form of texture. We have used two texture features, namely Local Binary pattern and Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix for automatic detection of ALL. A comparative analysis of both the features is presented.

abstract={Image enhancement is a technique to improve the quality metrics of a distorted image. In forensic laboratory, if the input is noisy fingerprint image then image enhancement plays the crucial role to authenticate the verification stage. In this work, the author proposed to construct a filter based on Log-Gabor theory for enhancement of high noisy (Gaussian Noise) fingerprint image. To construct the filter, first initialize all filter parameters and to overcome the wrap around effect, first calculate the sine and cosine differences along with angular distance. When the filter is constructed, do the convolution with FFT of input noisy image. The resultant enhanced image attained PSNR and MAE (Mean Absolute Error) 7.9230, 101.728 dB, respectively. The comparison values of quality metrics for Mat lab inbuilt function (wiener and median filter) are 7.3291, 7.3281, and 101.977, 101.986 dB respectively for same test image. In this work, there is a little improvement in PSNR value which play significant role in verification stage. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2016.},

abstract={Speech is the most popular communication medium used in real time. Speech is a one dimensional signal which is easily corrupted by the noise. De-noising is the only technique to remove the noise which is done in preprocessing techniques. Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is the efficient technique used for de-noising. Speech is recorded first and then preprocessed Spectrum is being calculated. The preprocessed speech is then jointly processed by MODGDF and MFCC technique for features extraction and later classified by Naive bias classifier technique for acquiring greater recognition accuracy. The proposed methods are implemented for 100 speakers uttering 10 words. The integrated performance of Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC), Modified group delay function (MODGDF) feature extraction technique and Naïve Bayes classification technique (NBC) is based on recognition accuracy.

abstract={The development of financial inclusive sector in India has been promising with mobile technology playing a prominent role. The rate of growth of rural teledensity is phenomenal. Mobile banking (M-Banking) has therefore proved to be a win-win situation for both banks and telecom companies. On a parallel track, it is seen that acceptance and adoption of mobile as a channel has been an issue in rural areas. There seems to be dearth of analysis of factors resulting in the slow rate of growth. This paper attempts to dig out barriers and enablers of M-Banking in rural India and weave them using an interpretive structural modelling (ISM). The model results in connecting the dots and help the policy makers of banks and telecom companies analyse the issues faced at various levels. The results will add to the body of literature and simultaneously help practitioners to understand the various levels of implementation. Copyright © 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={The energy band alignment at the heterointerfaces plays a vital role in understanding the physics and optical processes such as optical gain or optical absorption in semiconductor opto-electronic devices. This paper reports the behavior of field effective energy band alignment followed by the behavior of probability density of the charge carriers in the respective bands of type-I Al0.45Ga0.55As/GaAs0.84P0.16 symmetric nano-scale-heterostructures. In addition, the optical gain of the structure within TE (transverse electric) and TM (transverse magnetic) modes under constant electric field applied is also simulated and analyzed. In order to simulate the optical gain of the structure, 4 × 4 diagonal k→.P→ Hamiltonian matrix is solved for the purpose of getting envelope functions associated with carriers, carrier densities, dispersion curves of the quantum well structure, transition matrix elements and finally the optical gain. On behalf of simulated results achieved, it is reported that the optical gain in TM mode is found much greater than that in TE mode which is opposite to usual trends. Moreover, the application of external electric field along the growth direction shows that the optical gain within TM mode and the wavelength both can be controlled by controlling the electric field applied. Thus, the nano-heterostructure can be tuned externally by the application of external electric field within the NIR (near infra red) region. © 2016 Elsevier GmbH},

abstract={Due to its large scale applications in the real field, the study of bi-metallic nano-alloy clusters is an active field of research. Though a number of experimental reports are available in this domain, a deep theoretical insight is yet to receive. Among several nano-clusters, the compound formed between Cu-Ag has gained a large importance due to its remarkable optical property. Density Functional Theory (DFT) is one of the most popular approaches of quantum mechanics to study the electronic properties of materials. Conceptually, DFT based descriptors have turned to be indispensable tools for analyzing and correlating the experimental properties of compounds. In this venture, we have analyzed the experimental properties of the (Cu-Ag)n=1-7 nano-alloy clusters invoking DFT methodology. A nice correlation has been found between optical properties of the aforesaid nano-clusters with our evaluated theoretical descriptors. The similar agreement between experimental bond length and computed data is also reflected in this analysis. Beside these, the effect of even-odd alternation behavior of nano compounds on the HOMO-LUMO gap is very important in our computation. It is probably the first attempt to establish such type of correlation. © 2015 Prabhat Ranjan et al.},

abstract={In this paper, a novel design of a compact planar ultra wide band (UWB) monopole antenna with triple band notched characteristics has been presented. The antenna has a unique shape and has been fed through a 50 ω microstrip feedline. The strength of the antenna lies in three band notched properties for WiMax system at 3.3-3.7 GHz, WLAN IEEE 802.11a at 5.15-5.85 GHz and X band satellite communication at 7.25-8.395 GHz. The notched bands have been achieved by incorporating an inverted U-slot etched on the radiator patch, an inverted C-slot also on the radiator patch and a U-slot on the microstrip feed line. In order to achieve FCC defined impedance bandwidth of 7.5 GHz, a rectangular cut in the ground plane has been introduced along with staircase structure in the bottom edge of the radiator. The proposed antenna is having a compact size of 30 X 30 X 1.6 mm3 and exhibits a large bandwidth from 2.8 GHz to 10.7 GHz. The antenna has been successfully simulated and fabricated. The radiation pattern is omni-directional in H-plane and the E-plane exhibits dipole like radiation pattern. The gain of the antenna is stable across the whole operating frequency band except at three notched bands. © 2015 SBMO/SBMag.},

In order to analyze these aspects and to explore the comparative assessment, this work has utilized available statistical data of OECD. The study employed DPSIR methods outlined in the OECD report, which state that Indicators measure the decoupling of environmental pressure from economic growth for analyzing environmental pressure/degradation indicators, such as population growth, energy production, greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, CO2emission, SOx emission, NOx emission, water abstraction and waste with economic indicator, i.e., nominal and per capita GDP. The major finding of this study is that among the selected indicators, some resulted from relative decoupling rather than absolute decoupling, which means that the environmental pressure still increases, albeit at a lower rate than economic performance, and that the presence of decoupling is not an indication for sustainable economic development. © 2015 Taylor and Francis.},

abstract={The process of bioweathering involving natural microbes, natural plants and transgenic animals has proven to be a very efficient and effective tool for detoxifying xenobiotics. The present investigation uses the same tool as a device for detoxifying asbestos, a potent carcinogenic entity. The cellular mechanism of asbestos toxicity to a certain extent, as shown by research, is attributed to its chemical composition particularly the presence of iron in its structure. Many bacteria release iron chelating compounds, siderophores, which could be instrumental in the study. Treatment of asbestos was carried out under specific parameters with bacterial isolates native to the mines of Rajasthan from which asbestos was collected. An assessment was then done to evaluate reduction in iron content of the asbestos fibres by Scanning Electron Microscopy-Energy Dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX). A remarkable decrease was observed in the iron content of asbestos following treatment with most of the bacterial isolates used, which probably could form the basis for asbestos bioweathering studies. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={In this paper, a novel design of diaphragm based pressure sensor has been proposed, which may find its application in Intra Uterine Pressure Catheter (IUPC) system. The novelty of the device lies in the fact that it has got patterned slots over the top layer of the diaphragm similar to a chess-board pattern. This sensor is then compared with a plane diaphragm of same dimensions. In same range of input pressure, results show that the plane diaphragm has capacitive sensitivity of 0.06385 pF/kPa, while in the slotted diaphragm, it is 0.17355 pF/kPa, three times as that of the plane one. However, the static pull-in voltage comes out to be almost 16 volt due to constant air gap of 0.4 μm for both the cases. Due to pull-in voltage in the range of 11-20 volts, it can also be used as an electrostatic actuator in switching networks. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Performance and reliability of nanoscale memory and logic devices is determined by few electron-phenomena. In this context, the organic molecules may offer some advantages for future memory applications. Since, a molecule is the smallest component whose electrical properties can be engineered, it can be argued that the ultimate integrated circuit will be constructed at the molecular level. This fact has been the driving force behind molecular electronics research of recent times. This article investigates the aspects of modeling, synthesis and analysis of nanocell based molecular memory. In our work, we have developed the HSPICE as well as probabilistic models for nanocell based molecular memory. An attempt has been made to develop a CAD tool for synthesis of such molecular memories which are posing interesting and promising research challenges at futuristic cutting edge of technology spectrum. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Key message: Pithecellobium dulcehas a huge repository of morphological and genetic diversity within the species which has been documented for further tree research and breeding programmes. Abstract: A total of 40 accessions of a multipurpose leguminous tree, Pithecellobium dulce, differing in morphological and phenological characteristics was collected from different locations in Rajasthan and genetic diversity assessed using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers. Out of 60 RAPD primers, 43 decamer primers produced 311 scorable bands of which 223 bands were polymorphic. Polymorphic banding patterns with the number of amplified fragments varied from 1 (OPA-12 and OPF-17) to 12 (OPF-04, OPT-07, OPT-17, OPT-20). Percent polymorphism ranged from 33.3 % (OPF-07, OPA-20, OPT-05) to 89 % (OPA-13) with an average of 64.34 %. Out of the 20 ISSR primers screened, 8 primers produced 77 amplification products of which 55 were polymorphic. The number of bands amplified per primer varied between 6 (UBC-820) and 13 (UBC-808 and UBC-816) with average band size between 300 and 4,500 bp. Percent polymorphism ranged from 38 % (UBC-817) to 100 % (UBC-811) with an average of 71 %. Dendrogram constructed on the basis of combined RAPD and ISSR markers separated the accessions into five distinct clusters at 53 % variation with Jaccard’s similarity coefficient ranging from minimum similarity (0.35) between Karoli (K) and Malviya Nagar, Jaipur (MN1) to maximum similarity (0.81) between two populations of Kota (K1 and K2). The matrices for two markers, RAPD and ISSR, were also compared using Mantel’s test. The correlation value between the matrices is high (r = 0.83) indicating good correlation between the two molecular marker systems. The study indicated a high level of morphological and genetic diversity in P. dulce. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Spin-polarized Compton profiles of TbCo2 have been measured to elucidate the interesting behavior of spin and orbital moments at different temperatures. The magnetic Compton profiles (MCPs) have been analyzed in terms of site specific spin moments due to Tb-4f electrons, Co and itinerant electrons. The temperature dependence of the orbital moment has been deduced using Compton and magnetometry data ranging between 6 and 300 K. The present data exhibit a decrease in the ratio of orbital to spin moments from 43.9% to 35.0% (while going from 6 to 300 K). First-principles calculations within DFT + U scheme have also been performed to confirm the spin-, orbital- and site specific-magnetic moments in TbCo2. An antiparallel exchange coupling between the Tb-4f and Co spin moments is found. The orbital moment is found to have a parallel coupling with the Tb spin moment, as evident from the experimental MCPs. From first-principles data it is seen that the orbital moments of Tb and Co sites are antiparallel to each other, as in the case of their spin magnetic moments. The present experimental study also shows an existence of an itinerant moment which is coupled ferromagnetically with the Tb-4f spin moment. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The present research protocol was developed to locate endophytic fungi present inside the healthy leaves of Tinospora cordifolia. The surface sterilized leaf explants after staining with lactophenol cotton blue showed the presence of endophytic fungi in intercellular spaces of ground, dermal tissue especially in midrib region. Leaves have shown dense colonies of endophytic fungi. Microscopic examination of in vitro and in vivo leaves has shown mycelium which was dense, branched and septate. Hence, the comparative study was conducted in both in vitro and in vivo leaves of T. cordifolia to locate endophytic fungi. The present study revealed that the fungi are not only developed in plants under natural environment but also under controlled conditions i.e. tissue culture of plants. Therefore, the present research work favoured the view that endophytes can infect nutrient medium of in vitro culture of T. cordifolia and diversity of endophytic fungi increase after hardening and acclimatization of T. cordifolia plantlets. The presence of endophytes in in vitro cultures depends both on age of tissue and host genotype. Further studies are required to isolate the endophytic fungi, pure culture on PDA plates and their identification to explore their biosynthetic pathway. © 2015 Elsevier GmbH.},

abstract={Localization is extensively used in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) to identify the current location of the sensor nodes. A WSN consist of thousands of nodes that make the installation of GPS on each sensor node expensive and moreover GPS will not provide exact localization results in an indoor environment. Manually configuring location reference on each sensor node is also not possible in the case of dense network This gives rise to a problem where the sensor nodes must identify its current location without using any special hardware like GPS and without the help of manual configuration. Localization techniques make the deployment of WSNs economical. Most of the localization techniques are carried out with the help of anchor node or beacon node, which knows its present location. Based on the location information provided by the anchor node or beacon node, other nodes localize themselves. In this paper we present a succinct survey on the localization techniques used in wireless sensor networks covering its problems and research gap. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={The main concentration of the present paper is on the cost-benefit analysis of a cold standby system with the concept of priority, preventive maintenance and arrival time of the server. For this purpose, a stochastic model is designed in which one unit is operative initially and other unit is kept as cold standby. A single repair facility is provided, which takes some time to arrive at the system to do PM and repair of the components as per the requirement of the system. Server does not do the preventive maintenance, if there is no spare unit available for use. All random variables are statistically independent. The unit after repair and preventive maintenance is considered as good as new. All times distributions are exponential except the repair, arrival time of server and preventive maintenance time distributions, which are considered as general.

abstract={Adhoc On Demand Vector (AODV) is a demand driven routing protocol in Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET). There is always a resource constraint in adhoc network and threat from malicious nodes and hence feasible solution is preferably needed. For this reason, in this paper, we propose a new methodRTMAODV(Real Time Monitoring AODV). It does not introduce any overhead. Moreover neighbor node detects and prevents black hole attack using real time monitoring. The new proposed method is effective for multiple sessions. The concept of broadcasting is being used in the method. Node which replies to RouteRequest (RREQ) by source is being monitored in promiscuous mode. Detection of malicious node is actually done by neighbor node of RouteReply (RREP) sender node. In simulation, new method has shown outstanding result in terms of packet delivery ratio as compare to AODVrouting protocol in presence of malicious node under black hole attack. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Wireless Sensor Networks are known for their wide range of applications in which no human intervention is required. But the main challenge of Wireless Sensor Networks lies in achieving communications with low energy consumption. In order to overcome the problem of energy consumption, a well-known clustering algorithm, LEACH (Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy) was designed. However, LEACH has some disadvantages. In this paper, we propose a new clustering algorithm based on LEACH. It establishes a new Threshold which includes the node energy and distance between node and base station and distance between cluster head and base station for measuring the threshold value. Simulation results show that proposed algorithm is better than LEACH in balancing the node energy and thus enhancing the network lifetime. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The main aim of the present paper is to analyze the stochastic behavior of a cold standby system with concept of preventive maintenance, priority and maximum repair time. For this purpose, a stochastic model is developed in which initially one unit is operative and other is kept as cold standby. There is a single server who visits the system immediately as and when required. The server takes the unit under preventive maintenance after a maximum operation time at normal mode if one standby unit is available for operation. If the repair of the failed unit is not possible up to a maximum repair time, failed unit is replaced by new one. The failure time, maximum operation time and maximum repair time distributions of the unit are considered as exponentially distributed while repair and maintenance time distributions are considered as arbitrary. All random variables are statistically independent and repairs are perfect. Various measures of system effectiveness are obtained by using the technique of semi-Markov process and RPT. To highlight the importance of the study numerical results are also obtained for MTSF, availability and profit function. © 2015 Growing Science Ltd. All Right reserved.},

abstract={Wireless networks are becoming a combination of more and more diverse and complicated networks. Handoff is a process to maintain data session continuity where mobile node changes from one base station coverage area to another base station area. Mobile maintains its existing connections via vertical handoff. In wireless environment single node mobility is known as host mobility and group of nodes moving together as single network is known as Network Mobility (NEMO). NEMO is extension of MIPv6, invented for reducing number of individual handoffs. To influence smooth mobility between these heterogeneous wireless access networks, expeditious and dependable vertical handoff (VHO) schemes are required. While taking VHO decision several parameters has to consider like received signal strength (RSS), addressable bandwidth, power intake, monetary cost, security, user predilection and etc. In this paper various handoff decision techniques based on different parameters for host mobility, and vertical handoff technique for Network mobility (NEMO) are discussed. Finally gave research issues and future research directions to NEMO. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, multi-walled carbon nanotubes are synthesized by arc-discharge and chemical vapor decomposition methods. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes are synthesized on thin film of nickel sputtered on silicon substrate by thermal chemical vapor deposition of acetylene at a temperature of 750°C. The flow of current in arc-discharge method varies in the range 50–200 A. Further arc-synthesized carbon nanotubes are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and the results are compared with nanotubes grown by chemical vapor deposition method. XRD result shows a characteristic peak (0 0 2) at 26.54° corresponding to the presence of carbon nanotubes. SEM and TEM results give morphology of as-synthesized multi-walled nanotubes. TEM results indicate synthesis of well-graphitized carbon nanotubes by arc-discharge method. Dispersion of arc-synthesized nanotubes in SDS solution under the effect of different sonication times is studied. Dispersion of nanotubes in SDS solution is analyzed using UV–vis–NIR spectroscopy and it shows an absorption peak at 260 nm. It was found that with the increase in sonication time, the absorption peak in UV–vis–NIR spectra will increase and optimum sonication time was 2 hours. Functionalization of synthesized carbon nanotubes by H2SO4 and HNO3 acids has been studied and analysis of functionalized groups has been done using FT-IR spectroscopy and compared and the results are reported in this paper. FT-IR spectroscopy verifies the presence of carboxylic groups attached to carbon nanotubes. These functional groups may change properties of carbon nanotubes and may be used in vast applications of carbon nanotubes. © 2015 The Author(s).

A complete quenching of photoluminescence (PL) of PS along with a considerable change of the optical properties of the dye rhodamine 6G (R6G) in PS has been achieved. For all states of preparation of the sample, PL, UV/vis transmission spectroscopy and electrical measurements were carried out. From our transmission and electrical measurements we concluded that the quenching of PL is attributed to a fundamental disruption of the luminescence mechanism. A blue shift in the PL peak of R6G in PS compared to bulk R6G is attributed to an efficient quantum confinement effect. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.},

abstract={The present paper addresses the solution for gene subset selection problem with the help of proposed hybrid model for the binary class classification task under supervised learning. As established facts that filter approach is better than wrapper in terms of computational efficiency and time consumption. On the other hand, accuracy of wrapper is higher in comparison to filter. The dilemma faced by the researchers, can be minimised by developing a hybrid model to utilise the efficiency of the filter and accuracy of wrapper together to get the best possible outcome in terms of optimum accuracy. Here the selection of filter is as ReliefF algorithm and wrapper as randomised gene subset selection algorithm. The proposed model is, to first applying an accurate filter, to find out most relevant gene and further applying the efficient wrapper to extract most informative gene from the previous one and optimum gene subset is appreciated by linear as well as an ensemble classifier to classify public domain viz. leukaemia, ovarian cancer, lymphomas and prostate tumour datasets with fivefold cross validation calculation and also signifies the performance measures of the classifiers along with time measurement. The obtained results justify the applicability of the proposed method. Copyright © 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={Surface geometry plays an important role in case of analyte sensing and RF switching using beams and electrodes. In general, rather than simply supported beam and diaphragm, microcantilever beams are widely preferred in BIO-MEMS and RF-MEMS for biosensing and RF switching, respectively. The lower level detection ability and simple structure make these cantilevers more applicable in many applications. The rectangular cantilever beams are most widely used in TG detection. but due to their constant or planner geometry and non-adhesion of analyte they are less sensitive in case of nano or pico level biosensing. This paper introduces the fractal surface geometry concept for increasing the deflection sensitivity corresponding to lower molecular or analyte loading. The rectangular and stepped cantilever beam structures along with fractal surface are simulated and analysed for TG molecular pressure 294.3 Pa. Both the rectangular and stepped microcantilever beams with fractal surface exhibit better free end or tip deflection (nearly 2×) as compare to the planner surface based beam. The proposed fractal concept also reduces the actuation voltage requirement for perfect switching. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Structuring public private partnerships (PPP) in railways is a challenge, given its technology base, and obligation as a public and affordable mode of transportation. The sector provides strong incentives for vertical integration due to economies of scope. However, it is evident from the literature that large integrated PPPs in railway systems are not feasible due to higher commercial risks. They also suffer from implicit cross subsidization since the railway infrastructure is capital intensive, common to multiple revenue sources, and fare box revenues are generally not sufficient to recover investments. This is being addressed by various unbundling approaches in recent PPPs. The common unbundling is between infrastructure, operations, and services.The objective of this research is to explore the potential of unbundling further and to come up with a framework that helps policy makers in taking macro level decisions on PPP structuring. The research disaggregates the railway system into over 40 'elements' wherein an element is the smallest unit that can be given to a party for execution. However this unbundling would result in significant horizontal and vertical interfaces between these elements.A sustainable PPP would need to limit the extent of interfaces due to transaction costs and risks. This can be achieved by bundling the elements horizontally and/or vertically into 'entities' to extract the best value for a PPP. The governing principles would be scale economies (horizontal integration), scope economies (vertical integration), need for competition (horizontal disaggregation), level playing field, transactional transparency, and need for specialization (vertical disaggregation). Additional drivers would be appetite for investment, availability of competence and accountability for an entity. The findings of the research indicate that the entity formation is one of the most crucial aspects of a PPP in railways.A consequential critical area is managing the interfaces between entities, which are subject to transaction costs and risks. These should be carefully identified and addressed by well-designed contractual agreements and independent regulation. © 2014 World Conference on Transport Research Society.},

A stochastic model for a data processor system consisting of two identical units-one is operative and the other kept as a standby is developed. A single repair facility is supplied to the system which plays the double function of the sensor as well as a maintenance man. Upon failure of the detector to detect the fracture of the hardware component unit immediately replaced by the maintenance man. Nonetheless, only up-gradation of the software is made upon failure.

abstract={This work aims to reveal the underlying effect of improved power factor on the life of Self Ballasted Fluorescent Lamps commonly termed as CFL. In the third world country like India because of cost effectiveness CFLs are still used without any power factor correction circuitry. Recently the power factor improvement tool is made compulsive for CFL and the recommended range as suggested by IEC 61000-3-2 is greater than 0.85. In addition to this the current harmonic distortion is preferred to be around 30% as per the standards. But unfortunately there are still CFLs available in the market which have less power factor in comparison with the desired standards. This has caused substantial problems not only on the generation side, but it certainly has considerable impact on the lamp performance. In the present work in order to exemplify this problem, four CFLs of 15W each from two different manufacturers are used for the experiment. Out of these four lamps, two lamps are ballast with low input power factor and instant start type. The other two are incorporated with improved input power factor having rapid start or warm start circuitry. The lamps are constantly switched ON and OFF at regular intervals. The interval was taken as 5 minutes ON and 5 minutes OFF. The lamps were subjected to this accelerated switching test. At the end of every switching cycle the electrode temperature was calculated from the ratio of hot resistance to cold resistance. It was thus observed that lamps with instant start ballast and poor power factor were unable to sustain the switching stress as compared to the lamps with rapid start ballast and improved power factor. Furthermore, the rise in electrode temperature for the lamps with improved power factor was within the desired standards. Thus it was concluded that lamps with poor power factor was more prone to early end in comparison with the other variety. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={In this study, the authors propose a novel extended continuous time birth-death model for reliability analysis of a nanocell device. A nanocell consists of conducting nanoparticles connected via randomly placed self-assembled monolayer of molecules. These molecules behave as a negative differential resistor. The mathematical expression for expected nanocell lifetime and its availability, in presence of transient errors is computed. On the basis of the model, an algorithm is developed and implemented in MATLAB, PERL and HSPICE, to automatically generate the proposed model representation for a given nanocell. It is used to estimate the success_ratio as well as the nanocell reliability, while considering the uncertainties induced by transient errors. The theoretical results for reliability are validated by simulating HSPICE model of nanocell in presence of varying defect rates. It is observed that the device reliability increases with increase in the number of nanoparticles and molecules. A lower and upper bounds for nanocell reliability are calculated in theory which is validated in simulations. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2015.},

abstract={The use of mobile agents for collaborative processing in wireless sensor network has gained considerable attention. This is when mobile agents are used for data aggregation to exploit redundant and correlated data. The efficiency of agent-based data aggregation depends on the agent migration scheme. However, in general, most of the proposed schemes are centralized approach-based schemes where the sink node determines the migration paths for the agents before dispatching them in the sensor network. The main limitations with such schemes are that they need global network topology information for deriving the migration paths of the agents, which incurs additional communication overhead, since each node has a very limited communication range. In addition, a centralized approach does not provide fault tolerant and adaptive migration paths. In order to solve such problems, we have proposed a distributed approach-based scheme for determining the migration path of the agents where at each hop, the local information is used to decide the migration of the agents. In addition, we also propose a local repair mechanism for dealing with the faulty nodes. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme performs better than existing schemes in the presence of faulty nodes within the networks, and manages to report the aggregated data to the sink faster. © 2015 KIPS.},

abstract={In Bioinformatics, gene dataset experiments are generating thousands of gene expression measurements, which generally used to collect information from tissue and cell samples regarding gene expression differences. Optimum gene selection from such gene expression datasets and their classification plays an important role for disease prediction & diagnosis. Further the task ahead to understand that, what is the best way of gene selection to get maximum classification accuracy from such high dimensional gene expression dataset, whether the filter is the best way to rely upon or wrapper approach can be the best suitable, beyond that which classifier works well with filter and with wrapper? To answer the question, in this paper, the performance of the filter vs. wrapper gene selection technique is being evaluated by supervised classifiers over three well known public domain datasets viz. Ovarian Cancer, Lymphomas & Leukemia. For optimal gene selection, ReliefF method is used as a filter based gene selection and Random gene subset selection algorithm is used as a wrapper based gene selection. For classification, different linear as well as an ensemble classifiers have been tested for their performances. This paper also tries to bring the fact of timing details so that through analysis, it can get derived upon that which approach is more appropriate for better time management as well as with high accuracy of the selected dataset. © 2014 IEEE.},

Naïve Bayes) estimate joint probability distribution p(x,y) or likelihood p(x or y) with the help of different density estimators, which are not suitable for large data sets due to their high time and space complexities. These classifiers also make different assumptions; allow limited dependencies among attributes and estimate one-dimensional likelihood. A new generative classifier known as MassBayes, works without making any assumptions and estimates multi-dimensional likelihood. We evaluate the MassBayes and two different versions of Naïve Bayes (Naïve Bayes using Kernel Density Estimator and Naïve Bayes using Discretisation) for Pendigits data set. Our evaluation shows that MassBayes can work efficiently on large and multi-dimensional datasets.

MANETs uses a decentralized and infrastructure-less network, thus making the nodes to route its messages / data with the help of intermediate nodes. Routing in MANETs is carried out with the help of broadcasting schemes, among which MPR is found to be the effectual and uncomplicated scheme. The MPR scheme broadcasts its messages only to the selected MPR nodes. The selected MPR node may be any node in the network, and there are no obligatory and adequate conditions that provides assurance about the selected node’s integrity. In this paper, we have proposed a novel approach in the MPR node selection, by adding a security feature prior to the MPR node selection. We have verified the time constraints and efficiency with the help of localization techniques. Future events are also been discussed. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={In this paper, a novel Differential Search Algorithm (DSA) approach is proposed to solve multiobjective optimization problems, called Multiobjective Differential Search Algorithm (MODSA). MODSA utilizes the concept of Pareto dominance to determine the direction of a super-organism and it maintains non-dominated solutions in the external repository. This approach also uses the external repository of super-organisms that is used to guide other super-organisms. It guides the artificial organisms to search towards non-crowding and external regions of Pareto front. The performance of proposed approach is evaluated against the other well-known multiobjective optimization algorithms over a set of multiobjective benchmark test functions. Experimental results reveal that the MODSA outperforms the other competitive algorithms for benchmark test functions. © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Feature selection is an optimization problem that selects the features that have minimum redundancy and maximum relevance to improve the efficiency of algorithms. In this paper, we have proposed a novel automatic unsupervised feature selection method based on gravitational search algorithm, called AFSGSA (automatic feature selection using gravitational search algorithm). In contrast to most of existing unsupervised feature selection techniques, the proposed AFSGSA requires no prior knowledge of the data to be classified and number of features to be selected. AFSGSA determines the optimal number of features of the data-set on the run. Statistical property of data-set is used to develop a novel threshold setting concept to refine the features. A novel fitness function is also proposed to make the search more efficient. The performance of AFSGSA has been compared with recently developed well-known feature selection techniques. The experimental results reveal the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed feature selection technique over other existing techniques. © 2014 by the IETE.},

abstract={The goal of this investigation is to study the three layered (core layer, intermediate layer, and peripheral layer) tubular flow of power law fluids with variable viscosity by peristalsis in order to investigate the strength of the role played by an artificially generated intermediate layer to ease constipation.The solution is carried out under the long wavelength and low Reynolds number approximations in the wave frame of reference as the flow is creeping one.The stream functions for each layer such as core layer, intermediate layer, and peripheral layer are determined.The expressions for axial pressure gradient, interfaces, trapping, and reflux limits are obtained. The effects of power law index and viscosities on pressure across one wavelength, mechanical efficiency, and trapping are discussed numerically. It is found that the pressure required to restrain flowrates and the mechanical efficiency increase with the viscosities of the intermediate and peripheral layers as well as with the flow behaviour index. It is observed that the axisymmetric flow in intestines is less prone to constipation than two-dimensional flow and may be more easily overcome with introducing a viscous intermediate layer. © 2015 S.

abstract={A unique applicability of Compton spectroscopy in probing the electronic states of rare earth aluminides using high energy (662 keV) γ-rays is reported. We have measured first-ever Compton profiles of Dy1-xErxAl2 (x=0, 0.2) using 20Ci 137Cs Compton spectrometer. The charge reorganization in Dy1-xErxAl2 (x=0, 0.2), on the formation of compound, has been discussed using the valence band Compton profile data. The experimental Compton profile data unambiguously establish charge transfer from Al to Dy (Dy and Er) on formation of x=0.0 (0.2) compound, which is in tune with spin polarized relativistic Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (SPR-KKR) calculations. A reasonable agreement between SPR-KKR based Compton profiles and the experimental data show applicability of the Green function method in predicting the electronic properties of rare earth compounds. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

To optimize the light extraction efficiency of LEDs, various types of facet-patterning have been introduced on the free surfaces of the n-GaN epitaxial layer. A drastic increase in light extraction efficiency of the LED is observed due to increase of random and multiple scattering of light through patterned surfaces. The improvement in overall light extraction efficiency for the LEDs having rectangular and hexagonal patterning in free surfaces have been estimated around 2.25 and 3.39 times of that of the LED structure with smooth free surface (i.e., without any patterning), respectively. © 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

abstract={A biofluid dynamics mathematical model is developed to study peristaltic flow of non-Newtonian physiological liquid in a two-dimensional asymmetric channel containing porous media as a simulation of obstructed digestive (intestinal) transport. The fractional Oldroyd-B viscoelastic rheological model is utilized. The biophysical flow regime is constructed as a wave-like motion and porous medium is simulated with a modified Darcy-Brinkman model. This model is aimed at describing the digestive transport in intestinal tract containing deposits which induce impedance. A low Reynolds number approximation is employed to eliminate inertial effects and the wavelength to diameter ratio is assumed to be large. The differential transform method (DTM), a semi-computational technique is employed to obtain approximate analytical solutions to the boundary value problem. The influences of fractional (rheological material) parameters, relaxation time, retardation time, amplitude of the wave, and permeability parameter on peristaltic flow characteristics such as volumetric flow rate, pressure difference and wall friction force are computed.

abstract={Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) has made a remarkable improvement in hardware design, resource efficiency, communication and routing protocols, and other aspects thereby, making it widely used in the current decade. Nowadays, people started preferring mobile nodes in the place of static nodes, which brought mobile sensor network into focus. Current position information always shows a key role in Mobile wireless sensor network (MWSN) and accurate localization has always been an encounter for mobile sensor nodes. Installing GPS receivers for each node would also increase network installation cost for a large network, thereby making the sensor nodes to identify its own location coordinates or location reference without using GPS, and is achieved with the help of a special node that knows its location coordinates and protocols, called anchor node. The localization process suffers some setbacks due to adversary nodes. The adversary nodes make the location process tedious by giving false location references. This paper's goal is to confer different localization techniques used by mobile sensor nodes to identify their location information and the attacks confronted during localization.

abstract={Nanoporous gold (npg) produced by dealloying of Au alloys has been recently proposed for many different applications from catalysis to bio-sensors. Furthermore, Au alloys constitute an important model system in the context of corrosion, dealloying, and stress corrosion cracking. Adsorbed self-assembled monolayers of thiol molecules inhibit the dealloying reaction. On thiol-modified Cu-Au alloys dealloying finally proceeds in a localized reaction instead of a homogeneous process. Using ethanethiols as an example, we show here that thiols can be effectively removed by application of anodic oxidation. Homogeneous porosity forms then after an oxidation step. In-situ X-ray diffraction and crystal truncation rod analysis of ethanethiol-modified Au (001) confirms that a bare Au surface is recovered after a similar oxidation step. In consequence, a multi-step dealloying process including complete initial thiol-layers as well as partially or fully re-cleaned surfaces can produce different micro-cracks, providing larger scale openings, and homogeneous nanoporous Au in between. Such hierarchically structured surfaces may show superior applicability for reactions where mass transport into the porous layer plays a decisive role for the reaction rate or detection probability. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Localization is extensively used in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) to identify the current location of the sensor nodes. A WSN consist of thousands of nodes that make the installation of GPS on each sensor node expensive and moreover GPS will not provide exact localization results in an indoor environment. Manually configuring location reference on each sensor node is also not possible in the case of dense network. This gives rise to a problem where the sensor nodes must identify its current location without using any special hardware like GPS and without the help of manual configuration. Localization techniques makes the deployment of WSNs economical. Most of the localization techniques are carried out with the help of anchor node or beacon node, which knows its present location. Based on the location information provided by the anchor node or beacon node, other nodes localize themselves. In this paper we present a succinct survey on the localization techniques used in wireless sensor networks covering its problems and research gap. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

abstract={Traditional naval architecture includes all the departments concatenated into a single physical network and if it has to be separated, then physically different network is formed. This paper strives on removing the logical single network whilst maintaining the physical network intact on all the departments by implementing VLAN. Various automation systems like IBS, IPMS, CCTV, APMS and communication systems could be on the same physical network (reducing the cabling) and logically separated leading to isolation of network traffic to specified systems and smooth running of the automation systems without additional load in it, further as VLAN segment the network into different broadcast domains so the packets are only delivered between ports that are combined for the same VLAN. The latency is of key importance, to boost this up, further rapid spanning tree protocol; RSTP is used to get better results. The monitoring software; wireshark was used to compare the analysis of latency, considering real time architectural parameters. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Sometimes it becomes very difficult to identify the valuable text written by some great personalities; especially when the text is not having a signature or the author is anonymous. Deserted manuscripts or documents without a title or heading can be an additional pain. It might happen that the work of dignitaries are lost or only some part of their valuable piece of work is found available in the libraries or with other storage media's. By deploying Zipf's law with the NLTK module available in python, this problem can be solved to a great extent, helping save the originality of the valuable texts and not leaving them unidentified. This can also be helpful in some real time data analysis where frequency plays an important role; plagiarism detection in written texts is one such example. NLTK is a strong toolkit which helps in extracting, segmenting, parsing, tagging and searching etc. of many natural languages with the help of python modules. In this paper it has been tried to combine Zipf's Law with NLTK to come up with a tool to identify the anonymous or deserted valuable texts. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

abstract={Interaction-centric capabilities for engaging consumers are the basis of "co-creation capabilities" of a firm. These capabilities can be used as a strategic tool to develop competitive advantage for service firms under service-dominant logic. The authors develop a "co-creation continuum" for scaling of services, based on their relative extent of co-creation capability. The study establishes consumer's knowledge about the service process or the application technology, flexibility within the service processes, level of people interaction involved, and degree of importance of the service, as the underlying factors determining co-creation capability of a service. Practicing managers can use this continuum to effectively develop consumer co-creation strategies, by gauging the existing capabilities of their firm and hence, focusing on key areas of improvement. This research also conceptualizes a "co-creation willingness matrix," which is helpful in classification of services based on the firm-consumer willingness to co-create. This classification is useful for the firms lying on the disadvantageous end of the co-creation continuum, to reap the benefits of high level of consumer value co-creation by displaying higher willingness to co-create and by generating consumers' willingness to co-create by adopting suitable strategies. This article also sets out agenda for future research. © 2014 Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={In this information age, providing security over the Internet is a major issue. Internet security is all about trust at a remote distance, because we are dealing with everyone remotely and not able to confirm identity or authenticity in the traditional sense. To increase the password authentication a scheme was proposed by Chun-Ta Li which is basically a smart card-based password authentication and update scheme. The Chun's scheme provides user anonymity and eviction of unauthorized users. In our research work we have crypt analyze the Chun's method and shown that it is vulnerable to various types of attacks: insider attack, off line password verifier attack, stolen verifier attack and impersonating attack. To overcome the security vulnerability of Chun's scheme, we have proposed an advance scheme of password authentication and user anonymity using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and stegnography. The proposed scheme also provides privacy to the client. Based on scheme performance criteria such as immunity to known attacks and functional features, we came to the conclusion that the proposed scheme is much efficient and solves several hard security threats. © 2014 IEEE.},

The recent development and implementation of new technologies have led to a new trend, the nano-revolution unfolding the role of plants in bio- and green synthesis of nanoparticles which seems to have drawn a quite unequivocal attention to the synthesis of stable nanoparticles. Although nanoparticles can be synthesized through many conventional methods, biological route of the synthesis is more competent than the physical and chemical techniques. Biologically synthesized nanoparticles have enjoyed an upsurge of applications in various sectors. Hence, the present study envisions biosynthesis of nanoparticles from plants which are emerging as nanofactories.

abstract={In the present paper, some reliability measures of a computer system of two cold standby identical units are obtained using a semi-Markov process and a regenerative point technique. For this purpose, a reliability model is proposed by considering independent h/w and s/w failure. Initially, one unit is operative and another is kept as spare in cold standby. A single server is provided to conduct preventive maintenance, repair, replacement and up-gradation of the components upon their failure. Then, a maximum operation time system undergoes preventive maintenance, directly from normal mode. If the repair of the h/w is not possible by the server up to a pre-specific time, it is replaced by a new one with some replacement time. However, only up-gradation of the software by a new one is made whenever s/w fails to execute the desired function properly. Priority to h/w repair is given over h/w replacement and s/w up-gradation. The failure time distribution of the h/w and s/w follows a negative exponential while the distributions of preventive maintenance, repair, up-gradation and replacement time are taken as arbitrary with different probability density functions. To depict the importance of the study, graphs are drawn for a particular case with fixed values of other parameters and costs. © 2014 Jordan Journal of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering.},

It is observed that the surface of plasma treated polyester is more hydrophilic due to incorporation of nitrogenous polar functional groups and shows different conformational composition and crystallinity. The ATR–FTIR results clearly indicate the conversion of trans ethylene glycol residue to gauche one after plasma treatment and thus reduction in crystallinity. Plasma treatment has shown synergetic effect on dye uptake.

abstract={Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are on a steady rise in the current decade because of its progressions in hardware design, resource efficiency, communication and routing protocols, and other aspects. Recently, people started preferring mobile nodes in the place of static nodes, which brought mobile sensor network into focus. Location information always plays a key role in Mobile wireless sensor network (MWSN) and precise localization has always been a challenge for mobile sensor nodes. Deploying GPS receivers for each node would render network deployment cost for a dense network. The unavailability of GPS in indoor and underground environment has also put the installation of GPS into question. This makes the sensor nodes to identify its location coordinates or location reference without using GPS, and is achieved with the help of a special node that knows its location coordinates and protocols, called beacon node. This paper’s goal is to confer different localization techniques used by mobile sensor nodes to identify their location information. Problems and future issues have also been discussed. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.},

abstract={Expressed sequence tags (EST) are potential source for the development of genic microsatellite markers, gene discovery, comparative genomics, and other genomic studies. In the present study, 7630 ESTs were examined from NCBI for SSR identification and characterization. A total of 263 SSRs were identified with an average density of one SSR/4.2 kb (3.4% frequency). Analysis revealed that trinucleotide repeats (47.52%) were most abundant followed by tetranucleotide (19.77%), dinucleotide (19.01%), pentanucleotide (9.12%), and hexanucleotide repeats (4.56%). Functional annotation was done through homology search and gene ontology, and 35 EST-SSRs were selected. Primer pairs were designed for evaluation of cross transferability and polymorphism among 11 plants belonging to five different families. Total 402 alleles were generated at 155 loci with an average of 2.6 alleles/locus and the polymorphic information content (PIC) ranged from 0.15 to 0.92 with an average of 0.75. The cross transferability ranged from 34.84% to 98.06% in different plants, with an average of 67.86%. Thus, the validation study of annotated 35 EST-SSR markers which correspond to particular metabolic activity revealed polymorphism and evolutionary nature in different families of Angiospermic plants. © 2014 Shamshad ul Haq et al.},

The failure time of the unit follows negative exponential distribution while the distribution of arrival time, preventive maintenance time, repair time and replacement time of the unit are taken as arbitrary with different probability density functions. The system has been analyzed stochastically in detail using semi-Markov process and regenerative point technique. The behavior of some important measures of system effectiveness has been observed graphically giving particular values to various parameters and costs. © 2013, UK Simulation Society.

abstract={Major industrial sectors like automotive, aerospace and others are increasingly using adhesively bonded high performance polymers in their structural parts. Unfortunately, the surface of polymers is chemically inert and, therefore, exhibits poor adhesion properties. It is established that for successful application of polymeric materials to form structural parts using adhesive bonding, they need to have certain surface properties like polarity/high surface energy. This review article discusses the effect of modifying polymer surfaces by different plasma techniques on the surface energy and surface roughness of the polymers which play an important role in improving adhesive bond strength.},

abstract={In this manuscript, a fast improved technique is proposed for handwritten Devanagari numerals recognition. Today's scenario demands along with the high recognition rate require a technique which is fast and computationally efficient. Existing technique Foreground sub-sampling (FS) is based on the horizontal and vertical projection computation at each granularity level to find the division points. Here we proposed a technique through which the computation of horizontal and vertical projection at each granularity level becomes fast and efficient by using vertical and horizontal integral image. If sample image is 90 by 90 sized by FS technique at granularity level 3, 62100 addition (+) operations are required to find 85 division points while in our proposed technique only 18000 addition (+) operations are enough to compute same features. So the computation time of foreground subsampling technique is reduced 3 times. Our database (handwritten Devanagari numerals) is given by ISI (Indian Statistical Institute), Kolkata. The size of training and testing data are 18783, 3763 respectively and 98.97 % recognition accuracy is achieved.},

abstract={Global production of textiles products has increased more than 72.5 million metric tonnes of which synthetic fibers form an important part [1]. In fact, the production of natural fibers surpasses by synthetic fibers with more than 55% of products in the textile industry [2]. Polyester is the most used synthetic fiber first commercially produced by the du Pont Company. Polyesters are made from chemical substances found mainly in petroleum and are manufactured in three basic forms-fibers, films and plastics of which polyester fibers used to make fabrics is the largest segment. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) (Fig. 1) is the most common polyester used for textile manufacturing. PET is synthesized from ethylene glycol with either terephthalic acid (Fig. 2) or its methyl ester in the presence of an antimony catalyst under high temperature and vacuum to achieve high molecular weights needed to form useful fibers. Production of polyester accounted of 30.3 million metric tonnes in 2008 representing about 72% of the entire man-made fiber [1]. The 2009 global aggregate polyethylene terephthalate output summed up 49.2 m tonnes, of which PET fiber accounted for about two-thirds, whereas PET for packages and films 34% [1]. In 2010, the world textile industry has experienced the most potent growth in 25 years. Manufacturing volumes of natural and manmade fibers rocketed upwards by 8.6%, or 6.4 million tonnes, at 80.8 million tonnes of polyester indus- polyester indus-industrial filament yarn jumped up by spectacular 37%. Viscose fibers produced a record-breaking growth of 17% [2]. PET fibers are expected to account for 50% of the world fibers production in 2012 [1]. © 2013 by Apple Academic Press, Inc.},

abstract={Visual cryptography (VC) is a useful technique that combines the notions of perfect ciphers and secret sharing in cryptography. VC takes a binary image (the secret) and divides it into two or more pieces known as shares. When the shares are printed on transparencies and then superimposed, the secret can be recovered. No computer participation is required. There are various measures on which performance of visual cryptography scheme depends, such as pixel expansion, contrast, security, accuracy, computational complexity, share generated is meaningful or meaningless, type of secret images (either binary or color) and number of secret images(either single or multiple) encrypted by the scheme. In this paper, we will summarize the developments of visual cryptography since its birth in 1994, introduce the main research topics in this area where researchers have been contributing and outline the application of these schemes. © Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2013.},

abstract={Recently, Roy et al., published the synthetic procedure of biologically active mesoionic heterocycles. They have observed a peculiar mechanistic feature that substituted mesoionic derivatives do not undergo cyclisation whereas the unsubstituted one readily participates into the cyclisation. It is also revealed from their experimental study that sulphur containing mesoionic heterocycles are less reactive as compared to the oxygen containing derivatives. In this report, we have evaluated theoretical DFT based local reactivity parameters like fukui functions, local softness and local philicity indices to validate the above mentioned experimental facts. We have also calculated the global reactivity parameters to explain the reactivity differences between the substituted and unsubstituted mesoionic derivatives. The nice correlation between the experimental and theoretical counterpart supports our venture. © 2013 by Apple Academic Press, Inc.},
