abstract={A hexagonal monopole ultra wideband (UWB) antenna with reconfigurable band suspension functionality is experimentally studied in this paper. The proposed antenna is capable to switch its resonance from entire ultra wideband to single band notched ultra wideband applications using single p-i-n diode switch. The impedance bandwidth enhancement of the antenna is achieved by optimization of the hexagonal radiating patch and the ground plane. Single slot is inserted in hexagonal patch to embed the p-i-n diode. Simulated and measured results of return loss, E/H-field patterns and gain are obtained and good agreement is achieved. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper aims to acknowledge the combined power of Big Data, position, motion sensors present in an everyday mobile phone while defocusing the use of GPS, thus lessening the privacy concern. The commonness of mobile phones and their inexpensive MEMS (Micro Electro Mechanical Systems) is exploited in this paper to derive meaningful information. The GPS-denied environment enables the projection of accuracy of location tracking. The scope of this paper is public transport vehicles like buses, metros, shuttles, tubes, trains, airplanes. An experiment is conducted using multiple phones at different locations within the same vehicle. We collect the MEMS sensor readings of various phones within an area and subject them to preprocessing, storing, analyzing and real-time comparing with each other. The concept here is that the readings will be similar, especially at notable data points like turns or acceleration/decelerations. The huge amount of sensor readings from various phones implies dealing with Big Data. The data analysis method used in the paper does not require calibrating the phone sensors. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Two-proton radioactivity with 2p halo is reported theoretically in light mass nuclei A=18–34. We predict 19Mg, 22Si, 26S, 30Ar and 34Ca as promising candidates of ground state 2p-radioactivity with S2p&lt;0 and Sp&gt;0. Observation of extended tail of spatial charge density distribution, larger charge radius and study of proton single particle states, Fermi energy and the wave functions indicate 2p halo like structure which supports direct 2p emission. The Coulomb and centrifugal barriers in experimentally identified 2p unbound 22Si show a quasi-bound state that ensures enough life time for such experimental probes.

abstract={Designing of a type-II nanoscale heterostructure and simulating their optical properties is critical for many applications and remains a challenge. This paper reports designing of a complex type – II ‘W’ shaped symmetric InGaAsP/GaAsSb nano-scale heterostructure grown on InP substrate and mechanism of the transitions taking place within the heterostructure which are responsible for optical properties. In addition, the band alignment, optical gain and lasing wavelength are also studied under the effect of applied external electric field ranging from 10 to 200 kV/cm and variable temperature. On the basis of outcome of the calculations, the proposed heterostructure can be claimed to show a very high optical gain (∼8000/cm) within the MIR (mid infrared) region. Moreover, the results achieved in the study suggest that the application of the both variable temperature and applied external electric field on the heterostructure can control the optical gain as well as lasing wavelength linearly. Due to the linear behavior of the proposed heterostructure, the tunable type –II InGaAsP/GaAsSb nano-scale heterostructure can be claimed as a very suitable heterostructure for the designing of photovoltaic devices operating in the IR region. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In this research study, empirical mathematical models for cutting forces and surface roughness have been developed to investigate the effect of axial depth of cut, feed, radial depth of cut and cutting speed in high-speed ball-end milling of Al2014-T6. Ball-end milling experiments have been planned using central composite design based on response surface methodology. The mathematical models have been established and tested for adequacy. A full quadratic model has been adopted for modelling. It has been found that axial depth of cut is the most dominant cutting parameter for the tangential and axial cutting forces, accounting for 49.38 and 47.12% contributions, respectively. Radial depth of cut is the most dominant parameter for radial force and contributes 69.94% for it. Results also revealed that force components decrease with increase in cutting speed. There is very small variation in cutting force components in the cutting speed range of 75–150 m/min at lower values of axial and radial depth of cut. Surface roughness is effected by cutting speed largely followed by feed. Multi-objective optimization has been performed using composite desirability to optimize the cutting parameters for minimum surface roughness and cutting forces simultaneously. Confirmation tests have been conducted using optimal set of cutting parameters. The results of confirmation tests are very close to the predicted results. © 2017, The Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering.},

abstract={Here we report an in-silico approach for identification, characterization and validation of deleterious non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) in the interleukin-8 gene using three steps. In first step, sequence homology-based genetic analysis of a set of 50 coding SNPs associated with 41 rsIDs using SIFT (Sorting Intolerant from Tolerant) and PROVEAN (Protein Variation Effect Analyzer) identified 23 nsSNPs to be putatively damaging/deleterious in at least one of the two tools used. Subsequently, structure-homology based PolyPhen-2 (Polymorphism Phenotyping) analysis predicted 9 of 23 nsSNPs (K4T, E31A, E31K, S41Y, I55N, P59L, P59S, L70P and V88D) to be damaging. According to the conditional hypothesis for the study, only nsSNPs that score damaging/deleterious prediction in both sequence and structural homology-based approach will be considered as 'high-confidence' nsSNPs. In step 2, based on conservation of amino acid residues, stability analysis, structural superimposition, RSMD and docking analysis, the possible structural-functional relationship was ascertained for high-confidence nsSNPs. Finally, in a separate analysis (step 3), the IL-8 deregulation has also appeared to be an important prognostic marker for detection of patients with gastric and lung cancer. This study, for the first time, provided in-depth insights on the effects of amino acid substitutions on IL-8 protein structure, function and disease association. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={Travelling Salesperson Problem being a classic combinatorial optimization problem is an interesting but a challenging problem to be solved. It falls under the class of NPhard problem and becomes non-solvable for large data set by traditional methods like integer linear programming and branch and bound method, being the earlier popular approaches. Genetic Algorithm based solutions emerged as the most popular tool to solve this which is a heuristic mechanism to find the closest approximate solution to the problem. In this paper, we approach Travelling Salesman Problem using GA approach, a natural selection technique which repeatedly modifies a population of individual solutions, with the added power of modern computing systems. Here we come up with a parallel version of GA for both multicore and many core architectures over OpenMP and CUDA in order to make some of the challenging problems like Vehicle Routing Problem for google maps, DNA sequencing and many more optimization problems involving a good amount of complex computation and data handling. The paper presents a comparative analysis of the results for both CUDA and OpenMP for various degree and structure of graphs depicting close approximation to the accuracy in terms of most optimal path for traversal with highly reduced execution time. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper predict the effect of the object's morphology on the final accuracy of the scanned data, for the case of contactless laser scanning. On the basis of the scanned objects morphology, two important process parameters are specified namely scanning angle and distance of the laser from the part surface. Experiments have been performed with different scanning conditions using full factorial design. An analytical prediction model for determining the standard deviation of the final surface is developed in terms of the aforesaid scanning parameters using response surface methodology (RSM). Furthermore, the optimal scanning parameters are predicted after comparing two almost unexplored nature inspired algorithms i.e. Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) and Moth-Flame Optimization (MFO). Finally, two realistic non-trivial case studies are considered for validation of the proposed methodology. The result shows that the standard deviation of the final reverse engineered models significantly reduced by 21.6% and 13.77%. The adopted methodology provides the optimal combination of morphological scanning process parameters with a considerable reduction in standard deviation for final scanned surface models. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter Berlin/Boston.},

abstract={Brownian motion had been a topic of interest since the last two centuries and researchers have investigated the motion considering size, environment and mass. Few attempts considering the non-rigidity had been published to establish correlation between variance and nanoparticle parameter like size, mass and non-rigidity (stiffness) [1] [2]. In continuation, the present work investigates the significance of non-rigidity (stiffness) on variance in motion of nanoparticle. This work is important to conclude on whether soft nanoparticle moves more or less vis-à-vis a hard nanoparticle. We developed a model using correlation technique applied on Langevin equation for Brownian motion of nanoparticle and based on the simulation results, it was found that the motion is significantly governed by the stiffness of nanoparticles. © 2017 IEEE.},

Since the flow regime is of low Reynolds number, normal propulsion systems would find itself impossible to produce net forward thrust in such media. A rigid helix is found to produce thrust force and is a perfect place to start with in low Reynolds number propulsion. In this paper, a set of helical flagella has been fabricated in macro domain and the effect of change of wavelength, wire diameter and helix diameter is investigated on the thrust force produced by rigid helical filament using Resistive Force Theory. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper reports structural, electrical, and gas sensing characteristics of n-ZnO/p-Si heterojunction diodes fabricated using RF sputtering technique. The microstructural and surface morphological properties have been studied using X-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy, respectively. The electrical properties of the fabricated diodes have been investigated using current-voltage (I - V) and capacitance-voltage (C - V) measurements. The estimated values for rectification ratio, ideality factor, and barrier height were found to be ∼100, 3.27, and 0.72eV, respectively, at room temperature. The values recorded for carrier concentration and barrier height using C - V measurement were 3.82× 1014 cm-3 and 0.79 eV, respectively. The value of series resistance using Chueng's function was found to be 1710 Ω. After detailed structural and electrical characterization, methanol sensing response (3-100 ppm) of n-ZnO/p-Si heterojunction diodes for the temperature range of 27 °C-150 °C have also been investigated. The optimum operating temperature for methanol sensing was found to be considerably low, i.e., 100 °C. The values of response magnitude, response time and recovery time at 100 °C were estimated as 82%, ∼4 and ∼7 s, respectively. The cross sensitivity study for the nearest interfering species, such as ethanol, 1-propanol, butanol, butanone, and benzene, has confirmed the high selectivity of n-ZnO/p-Si heterojunction diodes for methanol sensing. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, we present highly accurate and very efficient stack based surrogate models for standby (idle-time) statistical leakage estimation of CMOS circuits using sampling based methods. Our aim is to replace SPICE simulation with our proposed surrogate models, which can be used to evaluate samples generated by sampling methods in variation space. Our methodology initiates by first characterizing the leakage of basic transistor stacks and then provides estimate of the leakage of basic gates based on these stacks. Transistor stacks are extracted across various standard cells, which are used to estimate leakage of CMOS gates with different input vector combinations. We develop Support Vector Machine (SVM) regression surrogate models and characterize the transistor stacks of CMOS gates, while accounting the combined effect of process variations in transistor length (L), threshold voltage (Vth), oxide thickness (Tox), supply voltage (0.6V−1.2V), temperature (0°C−100°C) and width (28nm−200nm), all scalable at the same time. For gates containing parallel transistor stacks, we merge the parallel transistors having identical inputs, which in turn allows us to use precharacterized basic stacks for leakage calculation, thus avoiding generation of new models. Our experiments illustrate that we only require 30 and 26 stack models to predict the subthreshold and gate tunneling leakage of 20 different gates across 176 input combinations, instead of characterizing leakage model for each input vector separately. SVM regression models generated in our approach have the ability to predict the leakage with maximum average error of 2.7% in mean (μ) and maximum average error of 3.1% in standard deviation (σ), both for OAI22 gate. Our results establish that there is on an average 10× improvement in runtime while estimating the μ and σ of leakage of a gate within 10000 Monte Carlo simulation loop. Our approaches also result into a maximum of 221× runtime improvement for C6288 ISCAS'85 benchmark circuit. We further develop Sparse SVM models using Support Vector spectrum pruning method, which reduces the runtime of the regression models with negligible increase in the error. Runtime efficiency of 17× and 323× is achieved on standard cell library and C6288 benchmark circuit respectively using Sparse SVM models. Our models outperform previous models based on analytical equations and Artificial Neural Network in terms of accuracy. © 2017},

The model was developed in ANSYS and assigned to aluminium alloy 7475-T61 material model. The results showed that the residual stress become more compressive as the plate thickness is increased up to t/d = 2.6 and decreased for further level of thickness. In addition, the residual stress at the edge of the hole become more compressive as the expansion ratio is increased up to 4.5% and decreased for further level of expansion.

abstract={Automobile emissions are the main source of greenhouse gases (GHG) accumulation in environment. As old engines (Euro III or earlier) produce more emissions and it will be difficult to entirely stop their usage especially in developing and underdeveloped nations, it is desired that appropriate emission reduction technologies are tested on such engines to analyze their feasibility and economical acceptability. While most such studies have been conducted on constant speed stationary engines and modern engines, this study tried to analyze the effectiveness of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system on a Euro-1, water-cooled, direct injection, variable speed, compression ignition (C.I.) engine in a laboratory setup in India. This was done by testing an electronic control unit (ECU)-controlled EGR valve running the engine on different speeds; with different torques, as also with varying EGR percentages. Then optimum value of EGR valve opening for each set of engine speed and torque was determined, that is, corresponding to minimum oxides of nitrogen (NOx). Optimum EGR valve position was programmatically fed, for each set of torque and engine speed (in RPM), into EGR ECU and then the engine was run at varying speeds and torques and the emissions were verified in the automated mode. It was found that using EGR, NOx emissions were substantially reduced (average 45% reduction), without significantly impacting the engine performance. However, smoke emission increased with EGR. In order to counter the adverse effects, additional emission reduction technologies should be used in tandem with EGR. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 36: 1685–1693, 2017. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog},

abstract={A theoretical study is presented here for the electro-osmosis modulated peristaltic three-layered capillary flow of viscous fluids with different viscosities in the layers. The layers considered here are the core layer, the intermediate layer and the peripheral layer. The analysis has been carried out under a number of physical restrictions viz. Debye-Hückel linearization (i.e. wall zeta potential ≤ 25 mV) is assumed sufficiently small, thin electric double layer limit (i.e. the peripheral layer is much thicker than the electric double layer thickness), low Reynolds number and large wavelength approximations. A non-dimensional analysis is used to linearize the boundary value problem. Fluid-fluid interfaces, peristaltic pumping characteristics, and trapping phenomenon are simulated. Present study also evaluates the responses of interface, pressure rise, time-averaged volume flow rate, maximum pressure rise, and the influence of Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity on the mechanical efficiency (with two different cases of the viscosity of fluids between the intermediate and the peripheral layer). Trapping phenomenon along with bolus dynamics evolution with thin EDL effects are analyzed. The findings of this study may ultimately be useful to control the microvascular flow during the fractionation of blood into plasma (in the peripheral layer), buffy coat (intermediate layer) and erythrocytes (core layer). This work may also contributes in electrophoresis, hematology, electrohydrodynamic therapy and, design and development of biomimetic electro-osmotic pumps. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Quaternary and ternary alloy semiconductors offer an extra degree of flexibility in terms of bandgap tuning. Modifications in the wave functions and alterations in optical transitions in quaternary and ternary QW (quantum well) heterostructures due to external uniaxial strain provide valuable insights on the characteristics of the heterostructure. This paper reports the optical gain in strained InGaAsP/GaAsSb type-II QW heterostructure (well width = 20 Å) under external uniaxial strain at room temperature (300 K). The entire heterostructure is supposed to be grown on InP substrate pseudomorphically. Band structure, wave functions, energy dispersion and momentum matrix elements of the heterostructure have been computed. 6 × 6 diagonalised k→·p→ Hamiltonian matrix of the system is evaluated and Luttinger-Kohn model has been applied for the band structure and wavefunction calculations. TE mode optical gain spectrum in the QW-heterostructure under uniaxial strain along [110] is calculated. Optical gain of the heterostructure as a function of 2D carrier density and temperature variation is investigated. The variation of the peak optical gain as a function of As and Sb fractions in InGaAsP as a barrier and GaAsSb as a well respectively is exhibited. For a charge carrier injection of 5×1012/cm2, the TE optical gain is 3952 cm−1 at room temperature under no external uniaxial strain. Significant increase in TE mode optical gain is observed under high external uniaxial strain (1, 5 and 10 GPa) along [110] within IR (Infrared region) region. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={We employ the relativistic mean-field plus BCS (RMF+BCS) approach to study the behavior of sd-shell by investigating in detail the single particle energies, and proton and neutron density profiles along with the deformations and radii of even-even nuclei. Emergence of new shell closure, weakly bound structure and most recent phenomenon of bubble structure are reported in the sd-shell. 22C, 24O and 26S are found to have a weakly bound structure due to particle occupancy in 2s1/2 state. On the other hand 22O, 34Ca and 34,48Si are found with depleted central density due to the unoccupied 2s1/2 state and hence they are the potential candidates of bubble structure. 22C and 24O emerge as doubly magic with N = 16 in accord with the recent experiments and 26S emerges as a new proton magic nucleus with Z = 16. N = 14 and Z = 14 are predicted as magic numbers in doubly magic 22O, 34Ca and 34,48Si, respectively. These results are found in agreement with the recent experiments and have consistent with the other parameters of RMF and other theories. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={This paper presents and discusses AC-DC converters used for the Electrolysis of the non-ferrous metals and a case study of Aluminum Smelters at Hindalco to validate that thyristor converters are more energy efficient than diode converters. The most important factor in Aluminium production is the cost of energy used in the process of converting Aluminium oxide to Aluminium. This energy, which accounts for nearly 35% - 40% of the total cost of production of the metal, is primarily in the form of Direct Current (DC) power. DC Power is used in the process of electrolysis to convert Alumina (Aluminium Oxide) to Aluminium. With most of the production of electricity across the world is in the form of Alternating Current (AC) power, the process of conversion of this AC power to DC Power is critical. An efficient AC - DC converter becomes a critical component in the electrolytic reduction process of extracting non-ferrous metals in general and Aluminium in particular. The purpose of this research is to explore the reasons of mixed use of both the converter technologies, re-evaluate actual efficiency data on usage of both technologies and recommend the use of the more appropriate technology based on practical study. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Due to increased data movement and information exchange over internet and web, preserving data confidentiality and security has emerged as a prime concern for the end users. From bank transactions to document verification portals, from government official websites to social media, all these platforms share data remotely over web which contains certain confidential information and thus uses security mechanisms based on cryptographic algorithm to preserve the confidentiality of data preventing any information leakage or breach. RSA being the most popular public key cryptography based algorithm uses data encryption and decryption technique. It uses the mathematical concept of factorization of prime integers. The efficiency of the algorithm in terms of enhancing the security aspect to guess the factors of prime numbers increase when the numbers have high powers. Computing prime factors of these large numbers is compute intensive task where the serial programming makes RSA algorithm to slow down. The paper here presents an OpenMP based algorithmic modification to the code of RSA algorithm to improve the execution time using the parallel processing power of modern day multi-core architecture based machines. Experimental results under the lights of graphical representation shows a considerable speed up gained over the traditional implementation. Further the paper also compares the efficiency with other parallel implementations of RSA algorithm where the reported algorithm is found to perform almost equivalent to the GPGPU based implementation without the need of extra hardware in the form of graphics card and with reduced power consumption of the machine. The paper sums up with a conclusion that GPU based acceleration can be clubbed with proposed method to generate factors severely large prime numbers making it highly difficult to guess the factors.},

W-H plot for the powder samples annealed at 450°C and 750°C shows the presence of tensile strain in them which affects the particle size. The difference in particle sizes obtained from Debye-Scherer formula and W-H plot is seen to reduce for lesser strain value. The field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) images are observed to depict the agglomerated clusters of the particles whose average size favors the XRD results.

abstract={Human Gait is a model of movement while locomotion and it is known as behavioural characteristic of human. Gait recognition is a behavioural biometric method that includes human identification from afar i.e. in absence of human and this is achieved by analysing the behaviour of their walking. Main aim to make GAIT recognition system is to impart a best method to recognize risks in places where high security is required like in banking, parking, airports etc. or to detect disease like Parkinson’s. In this paper we have shown the importance of gait recognition in order to detect whether a human GAIT is normal or abnormal, firstly the features of human gait is collected and then they are classified using neural network (Back propagation) and KNN classification technique. To test the proposed system the database contains 204 gaits and 16 different features were recognised, in which 3 datasets are crouch gait dataset and one normal gait dataset of 4 different humans is collected. We have obtained 100% of classification accuracy for a training data. Testing results shows 39.65% accuracy overall accuracy of system is 69.825%.},

abstract={The present investigation focuses the effect of process parameters on material removal rate (MRR) and surface roughness (Ra) in wire electric discharge machining of Inconel 625. Machining was done by using a normal zinc coated wire and cryogenic treated zinc coated wire. The experiments were performed by considering different process parameters viz. tool electrode, current intensity, pulse on time, pulse off time, wire feed and wire tension. The thickness of work material and dia. of wire are kept constant. Taguchi L18 (21 * 35) orthogonal array of experimental design is used to perform the experiments. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is employed to optimize the material removal rate and surface roughness. Based on analysis it is found that pulse on time, tool electrode and current intensity are the significant parameters that affect the material removal rate and surface roughness. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) are used to identify the microstructure of the machined work piece. © 2017 King Saud University},

abstract={Composite materials are being extensively used in aerospace and automotive industry. The demand for composite materials is increasing due to their superior properties such as high strength to weight ratio, good corrosion resistance and high stiffness. Post machining operations such as drilling, orthogonal cutting, turning are necessary for composite materials to meet the dimensional and functional requirements. Drilling is a major process in manufacturing of holes, required for assembling the components in industrial applications. Drilling of holes in composites leads to a drilling-induced damage called delamination. The researchers have tried to reduce the drilling-induced damage by minimizing the operating variables and tool design. However, the research on delamination analysis using finite element method (FEM) is limited. This paper provides a comprehensive literature review on machining of composites which mainly focuses on conventional methods like turning, milling, trimming and drilling and also on simulation methods including discrete element method and finite element method. A brief and in depth review for drilling of composites using finite element method is delivered, which provides a knowledge on damage of the composites caused during drilling and orthogonal cutting. Comparison of experimental and simulation results shows an overall vision on machining of CFRP using FEM tools. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

These complexes were characterized by elemental analysis, FTIR and NMR (1H, 13C, 27Al) spectral studies. Spectral studies of these complexes suggest the presence of bi-dentate mode of the oximato moieties in the solution state. Soft transformations of aluminium(III) iso-propoxide and their oxime derivatives to pure alumina were carried out by the sol-gel technique. The powder XRD patterns of all the formed alumina suggest formation of cubic phase (γ-alumina) with average crystallites size of 7–30 nm. Optically transparent crack free alumina film was deposited on glass substrate using alumina sol, prepared by complex [Al(OiPr){ONC(CH3)2}], through dip coating method. The film sintered at 500 °C is amorphous in nature as indicated by XRD study. The alumina film is found to be ∼95% optically transparent in the visible region. The observed particle size distribution of alumina thin film in AFM images is found to be 13 ± 2 nm. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Mycosporine-like amino acids are the most common group of transparent ultraviolet radiation absorbing intracellular secondary metabolites. These molecules absorb light in the range of ultraviolet-A and -B with a maximum absorbance between 310 and 362 nm. Cyanobacteria might have faced the most deleterious ultraviolet radiation, which leads to an evolution of ultraviolet protecting mycosporine-like amino acids for efficient selection in the environment. In the last 30 years, scientists have investigated various cyanobacteria for novel mycosporine-like amino acids, applying different induction techniques. This review organizes all the cyanobacterial groups that produce various mycosporine-like amino acids. We found out that cyanobacteria belonging to orders Synechococcales, Chroococcales, Oscillatoriales, and Nostocales are frequently studied for the presence of mycosporine-like amino acids, while orders Gloeobacterales, Spirulinales, Pleurocapsales, and Chroococcidiopsidales are still need to be investigated. Nostoc and Anabaena strains are major studied genus for the mycosporine-like amino acids production. Hence, this review will give further insight to the readers about potential mycosporine-like amino acid producing cyanobacterial groups in future investigations. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

abstract={A numerical simulation for three dimensional steady flow of nanofluids passing through an exponential stretching sheet in presence of magnetohydrodymaics is presented. The surface of stretching sheet is considered as pervious. Buongiorno model associated with Brownian motion and thermophoretic diffusion is also employed. Well known similarity transformations are used to convert the governing equations into a set of ordinary differential equations. The transformed equations are then solved numerically using fourth order Runge-Kutta method. The effects of transverse magnetic field and permiability on dimensionless fluid velocity, fluid temperature, skin friction, Nusselt number and Sherwood number are examined. The numerical results accomplished in the present study are validated and felt to be in good agreement with the previously published results. The numerical computations reveal that that the Lorentz force due to presence of magnetic field impinges its resistance on fluid motion and enhances the thermal resistance. As a consequence, heat transfer rate from the sheet gets reduced in association with the porosity of the medium. © 2017},

abstract={This paper deals with a problem where the effect of variable magnetic field and chemical reaction on free convective flow of an electrically conducting incompressible water based nanofluid over an exponentially stretching sheet has been investigated. In the present study, Buongiorno model associated with Brownian motion and thermophoretic diffusion is employed to describe the heat transfer enhancement of nanofluids. Some suitable similarity transformations reduced the governing boundary layer non-linear partial differential equations into a set of ordinary non-linear differential equations. The transformed equations are then solved numerically using fourth order Runga-Kutta method along with Shooting technique. The major outcomes of the present study is that the magnetic field impedes the fluid motion while thermal as well as mass buoyancy forces accelerate it, the thermophoretic diffusion enhances dimensionless fluid temperature as well as concentration leading to thicker thermal and concentration boundary layers. On the other hand, concentration exponent, Brownian motion parameter and chemical reaction parameter exhibit reverse trend on temperature and concentration. In addition, the presence of magnetic field under the influence of thermal as well as mass buoyancies supports to reduce the rate of heat transfer as well as wall shear stress while the first order chemical reaction develops a thinner concentration boundary layer. © 2017 The Society of Powder Technology Japan},

abstract={This paper presents a novel approach in addressing a critical power system issue, i.e., automatic generation control (AGC) in a smart grid scenario. It proposes the design and implementation of an optimized fuzzy logic controller (FLC) for AGC of interconnected power network. There are three different sources of power generation considered in the two-area interconnected model of power system network. First area is equipped with a single reheat thermal unit and a superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) unit, while another area has a hydro-unit with SMES. A multi-stage optimization strategy for the optimal solution of FLC for tie-line and frequency oscillation suppression is proposed in this paper using an ant colony optimization technique. The optimization of FLC is carried out in four different stages. The first stage is the optimization of range of input and output variables; the second stage is the optimization of membership function; the third and fourth stages are the optimization for rule base and rule weight optimization, respectively. The performance of the proposed controller is also compared with another control approaches to stabilize Ptie-line and Δf oscillations; these are the Ziegler–Nichols-tuned proportional–integral–derivative (PID) controller and genetic algorithm optimized PID controller. A comprehensive analysis of the traditional techniques and proposed techniques is presented on the basis of major dynamic performance parameters, i.e., settling time and peak overshoot. © 2017, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Neuroinflammation, the condition associated with the hyperactivity of immune cells within the CNS (central nervous system), has recently been linked to a host range of neurodegenerative disorders. Targeting neuroinflammation could be of prime importance as recent research highlights the beneficial aspects associated with modulating the inflammatory mediators associated with the CNS. One of the main obstructions in neuroinflammatory treatments is the hindrance posed by the blood-brain barrier for the delivery of drugs. Hence, research has focused on novel modes of transport for drugs to cross the barrier through drug delivery and nanotechnology approaches. In this Review, we highlight the therapeutic advancement made in the field of neurodegenerative disorders by focusing on the effect neuroinflammation treatment has on these conditions. © 2017 American Chemical Society.},

This paper reports optical gain realized in Al0.8Ga0.2As/GaAs0.8P0.2 type-I QW-heterostructure (varying well width 6nm-22nm). Band alignment, wavefunctions and optical gain of the nano-scale heterostructure under electromagnetic field perturbation is reported. The 6×6 diagonalised k. p Hamiltonian matrix is evaluated and Luttinger-Kohn model has been applied for the band structure calculations. Optical gain spectrum in the QW-heterostructure under external electric fields of (20, 40 and 60 kV/cm) is calculated. Optical gain (x and z polarizations) of the nano-scale heterostructure under well width and temperature variations is investigated. The optical gain spectrum of the heterostructure is seen to gradually rise with shrinking well width. Also the optical gain curve shows a decrease in gain with rising temperature levels. For a charge carrier injection of 4 × 1012/cm2 the optical gain is ∼220 under input x polarization [100] and ∼625 under z polarization [001] at 300K. The heterostructure is seen to be operating in the energy range of 1.5 to 1.75 eV (708 to 826 nm). Thus, a wide range wavelength tuning is achievable. © 2017 IEEE.},

A good wavelength selective filter with bandwidth about 10.20nm and centre wavelength of pass band 1.4201um is achieved. In the next design, photonic crystal quasi-square cavity based ADF is realised with elliptical scatters for different major and minor axis configurations thus having different ellipticity. It is observed that the output response of the filter is very sensitive to the dimensions of coupling rods and scatter rods. It is observed that when the radius of the scatter rods is increased, then the centre wavelength of the bands get shifted towards higher wavelength range. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Abstract: Heteroleptic complexes of the type [V(NPh)(OiPr)3-n{(ONC)(CH3)(C4H3O-2)}n] {where n = 1 (1), 2 (2) and 3 (3)} were synthesized by the reactions of [V(NPh)(OiPr)3] (A) with 2-acetylfuryl oxime in different molar ratios in anhydrous benzene. All these new derivatives have been characterized by elemental analyses, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (1H, 13C {1H}), 51V) and fast atom bombardment mass spectral studies. Spectral studies appear to be indicating mono-dentate and bi-dentate mode of attachment of the oximato moieties in the solution and solid state, respectively. Fast atom bombardment mass study of one of the representative derivative, [V(NPh){(ONC)(CH3)(C4H3O-2)}3] (3) suggests the monomeric nature of all these complexes. Thermogravimetric curve of [V(NPh){(ONC)(CH3)(C4H3O-2)}3] (3) shows large thermal events. Hydrolysis of [V(NPh)(OiPr)3] (A) and [V(NPh){(ONC)(CH3)(C4H3O-2)}3] (3) in moist propan-2-ol medium yielded vanadia, (a) and (b), respectively. However, hydrolysis of [V(NPh)(OiPr)3] (A) in n-hexane medium using calculated amount of water yielded hybrid material, (vn).The presence of (V = NPh) group in (vn) is confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance spectral studies as well as by the thermogravimetric study. The X-ray diffraction patterns of vanadia, (a) and (b) indicate formation of orthorhombic phase and the scanning electron microscope images of (a) and (b) show rod like morphology of the crystallites. Absorption spectra of vanadia, (a) and (b) indicate energy band gaps of 2.62 and 2.43 eV, respectively. Graphical Abstract: Heteroleptic complexes of the type [V(NPh)(OiPr)3-n{(ONC)(CH3)(C4H3O-2)}n] {where n = 1, 2 and 3} were synthesized by the reactions of [V(NPh)(OiPr)3] with 2-acetylfuryl oxime. Hydrolysis of [V(NPh)(OiPr)3] and [V(NPh){(ONC)(CH3)(C4H3O-2)}3] in moist propan-2-ol medium yielded vanadia in orthorhombic phase, whereas, hydrolysis of [V(NPh)(OiPr)3] in n-hexane medium yielded hybrid material containing (V = NPh) linkages.

abstract={Biomimetic synthesis of metal nanoparticles (NPs) is safe and eco-friendly; therefore, find diverse applications. Considering this, the soil fungi Penicillium chrysogenum strain Fungal germplasm collection centre/BLS1 was isolated, characterized and explored to synthesize extracellular silver NPs (AgNPs) under optimised conditions. The synthesis of AgNPs was investigated using ultraviolet (UV)-visible spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis. Process optimisation exhibited AgNPs synthesis within 8 h using 2 mM AgNO3 at pH 11 and temperature 70°C. TEM analysis revealed polydispersed ellipsoidal shaped AgNPs with average particle size 96.8 nm as measured by DLS. AgNPs showed negative zeta potential that confers surface stability in solution. FTIR spectra confirmed the presence of protein bound to AgNPs. Antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus by the AgNPs (100 ppm) was demonstrated by counting colony forming unit, disc diffusion, and growth kinetics assay. Additionally radial assay revealed antifungal activity of AgNPs (100 ppm) against phytopathogenic fungi Sclerotinia sclerotiorum Microbial type culture collection 8785. Furthermore, AgNPs (100 ppm) did not show any cytotoxic effects on human Red blood cells. Therefore, this novel fungal strain can be utilised for biofabrication of AgNPs under optimised conditions and have shown strong antimicrobial property. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2017.},

abstract={This paper presents a modified particle swarm optimization (MPSO) algorithm for the evaluation of geometric characteristics defining form and function of planar surfaces. The geometric features of planar surfaces are decomposed into four components; namely straightness, flatness, perpendicularity, and parallelism. A non-linear minimum zone objective function is formulated mathematically for each planar surface geometric characteristic. Finally, the result of the proposed method is compared with previous work on the same problem and with other nature inspired algorithms. The results demonstrate that the proposed MPSO algorithm is more efficient and accurate in comparison to other algorithms and is well suited for effective and accurate evaluation of planar surface characteristics. © 2017 Vimal Kumar Pathak et al.},

abstract={This paper emphasizes the development of control strategy for inter-area oscillation suppression for a unified two-area hydro–thermal deregulated power system. A proportional derivative-type fuzzy logic controller with integral (PDFLC+I) controller was proposed for automatic generation control. Further comparisons among conventional integral controller, proportional integral derivative controller, and PDFLC+I are carried out, where the PDFLC+I controller is optimized by four different optimization techniques namely, algorithm, ant colony optimization, classical particle swarm optimization, and adaptive particle swarm optimization. In PDFLC+I controller optimization, scaling parameters of controllers are optimized. A comparative study shows that the proposed PDFLC+I controller has a better dynamic response following a step load change for the combination of PoolCo and bilateral contract-type transaction in deregulated environment. Proposed controller performance has also been examined for ±30% variation in system parameters. Non-linearity in the form of governor dead band is taken into account during simulation. © 2017, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={The present numerical simulations are carried out to investigate the effect of viscous dissipation, temperature dependent viscosity and heat source/sink on magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) unsteady Carreaue nanofluid over a cone filled with different alloy nanoparticles. We considered two different types of alloy nanoparticle namely nickel chromium iron alloy (Nimonic 80A) and titanium aluminum vanadium alloy (Ti%6Al%4V). The governing equations of the flow are solved using the Runge-Kutta and Newton's method. The present numerical results are compared with the previous study and found agreement with the uncertainty of ± 2.5%. Effects of various non-dimensional parameters such as Eckert number, power index parameter, volume fraction, heat source/sink parameter, viscous variation parameter and semi-vertical angle of the cone on the momentum and thermal boundary layer including the friction factor coefficients and local Nusselt number are presented and analyzed for two different alloy considered in the present study. It is found that the viscous variation parameter enables to enhance the heat transfer rate. The Ti%6Al%4V alloy has higher friction factor coefficient along the azimuthal direction of the flow while Nimonic 80A alloy boosts up the friction coefficient along the tangential direction. It is worth to mention that the heat transfer rate of Nimonic 80A alloy is higher than that of Ti%6Al%4V alloy. Hence, Nimonic 80A alloy signifies a better thermal performance than the Ti%6Al%4V alloy. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In a mobile wireless network, the unnecessary handoff is the main issue that effects the performance of the network. A handoff occurs when the Received Signal Strength (RSS) is less than the threshold RSS and the new RSS (from neighbors Access point) is more than the present RSS. Earlier the handoff decision algorithms consider RSS only which results in an increase in handoff counting or handoff rate but in a wireless communication system, the signal strength varies due to scattering, shadowing and reflection because of obstacles in the network region. This variation in RSS leads to unnecessary handoff. In this paper, a new method for handoff decision is proposed to reduce the unnecessary handoff. With simulation results or mathematical analysis 25% unnecessary handoff reduced. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Android operating system is widespread in today's smart-phone market due to its open source model, its easy functionality and huge number of Apps and App-Stores (the official and others). The coverage of some 90% of the market, it is also the place-holder for user's personal as well as sensitive information (IMEI, IMSI, etc.). There is a tendency of Apps user to trust on Android OS for securing his/her data but it has been proved that Android OS is more vulnerable to exploitation either for fun or for monetary purpose. Malware detection for Android OS has become an upcoming research problem of interest. Dynamic Taint Analysis is an efficient analysis in existing Android malware detection analysis. The aim of this paper is to work towards Dynamic Taint Analysis of Android malware using automatic tagging and with out modification in Android platform. In order to do this, this paper surveys exhaustively the available literature and works related to dynamic taint analysis. This paper proposes some novel ideas to improve the existing solution with more accuracy. There are two phases of our novel algorithm, the first phase is training phase for feature extraction and the second phase is the analysis phase for automatic tagging and tainting. We have developed a framework named AndroTaint, which is working on Dynamic Taint Analysis. AndroTaint follows a novel supervised and unsupervised Anomaly Detection technique with high precision, recall and harmonic mean. Our Dynamic Taint Analysis algorithm categorizes the App is risky, benign, malicious or aggressive as per their feature and behaviour. We have measured AndroTaint effectiveness on the basis of timeline for building dataset and 10-fold cross validation. AndroTaint covers 90% of malware and benign in analysis phase with less false positive and false negative. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={India's commercial building sector is witnessing robust growth. India continues to be a key growth market among global corporates and this is reflective in the steady growth in demand for prime office space. A recent trend that has been noted is the increase in demand for office spaces not just in major cities but also in smaller tier II and Tier III cities. Growth in the commercial building sector projects a rising trend of energy intensive mechanical systems in office buildings in India. The air conditioning market in India is growing at 25% annually. This is due to the ever increasing demand to maintain thermal comfort in tropical regions. Air conditioning is one of the most energy intensive technologies which are used in buildings. As a result India is witnessing significant spike in energy demand and further widening the demand supply gap. Challenge in India is to identify passive measures in building envelope design in office buildings to reduce the cooling loads and conserve energy. This paper investigates the overall heat gain through building envelope components and natural ventilation in warm and humid climate region through experimental and simulation methods towards improved thermal environmental performance. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Background and objectives This paper aims to investigate the unsteady flow of two types of nanofluids i.e Copper water nanofluids and Silver water nanofluids) through finite length non-uniform channel driven by peristaltic sinusoidal wave propagations. Methods The governing equations are reduced in linear form using dimensional analysis and considering the low Reynolds number and large wavelength approximations. The time dependent temperature field, axial velocity, transverse velocity and pressure difference are obtained analytically in closed form solution. Trapping phenomenon is also discussed with the help of contour plots of stream function. A comparative study of pure water (Newtonian fluid), Copper water nanofluids and Silver water nanofluids under the influence of relevant physical parameters is made in graphical form and also discussed. The effects of absorption parameter and Grashof number on velocity profiles, temperature profiles and pressure distribution along the length of channel are examined. Results conclusions The computational results reveal that the velocity profile is maximum for Silver water nanofluids however, it is least for Copper water nanofluids. It is also concluded the temperature profile is more for pure water in comparison to Silver water and Copper water nanofluids. This model is applicable to design, micro-peristaltic pumps which help in Nanoparticle-based targeted drug delivery and to transport the sensitive or corrosive fluids, sanitary fluids, slurries and noxious fluids in nuclear industry. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Education and human development are in conjunction with the dynamism of the contemporary world. The education system has sensed the need to churn out young entrepreneurs in order to drive the economy forward at a significant pace, and today entrepreneurship development is headway with a host of technical subjects. However, it is imperative to recognise that the entrepreneur is first and foremost, a brand on his/her own accord, even before he/she projects his/her company. One's image is crucial in the advancement of his/her venture and life at large. In today's competitive world, one has to stand out amidst the multitudes, personally as well as professionally. Technical know-how is not always enough as a professional. One needs the winning edge! Image Management concretely leverages one's position on the ladder of growth, success and recognition as well as aspirations in the vitality of the contemporary world. Thus emerges a weighty need for the incorporation of the study of Image Management in the education system for every budding entrepreneur. Ironically, the education system has yet to recognise and explore this area. The paper recognises this need and attempts to conceptually bridge the gap by bringing forth the relevance, purpose and utility of Image Management. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.

The density functional theory (DFT) in the framework of full potential linearized augmented plane wave (FP-LAPW) scheme has been used for the present calculations with local density approximation (LDA) and generalized gradient approximation (GGA). Electronic properties deal with energy bands and density of states (DOSs), while optical properties describe refractive index and absorption coefficient. The energy bands are interpreted in terms of DOSs. The computed value of band gap is in agreement with that reported in the literature. Our results predict AgScO2 as indirect band-gap semiconductor. Our calculated value of the refractive index in zero frequency limits is 2.42. The absorption coefficient predicts the applicability of AgScO2 in solar cells and flat panel liquid crystal display as a transparent top window layer. © Indian Academy of Sciences.},

abstract={This paper presents a mathematical model for simulating viscous, incompressible, steady-state blood flow containing copper nanoparticles and coupled heat transfer through a composite stenosed artery with permeable walls. Wall slip hydrodynamic and also thermal buoyancy effects are included. The artery is simulated as an isotropic elastic tube, following Joshi et al. (2009), and a variable viscosity formulation is employed for the flowing blood. The equations governing the transport phenomena are non-dimensionalized and the resulting boundary value problem is solved analytically in the steady state subject to physically appropriate boundary conditions. Numerical computations are conducted to quantify the effects of relevant hemodynamic, thermophysical and nanoscale parameters emerging in the model on velocity and temperature profiles, wall shear stress, impedance resistance and also streamline distributions. The model may be applicable to drug fate transport modeling with nanoparticle agents and also to the optimized design of nanoscale medical devices for diagnosing stenotic diseases in circulatory systems. © 2017, Società Italiana di Fisica and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.},

abstract={The poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) polymer blend films were prepared by solution casting method with varying PolyChloroTriFluoroEthylene (PCTFE) concentrations (1–5 wt %). The crystallinity, bonding behavior and disorder in the films were investigated with X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), UV–visible and ellipsometry techniques, while surface morphology was studied using Atomic force microscopy (AFM). The nanocrystalline nature of PMMA is seen to be preserved in the blends although there are clear indications of bond modifications. The addition of PCTFE results in the improvement of overall crystallinity of the films via the interaction among PMMA and degraded PCTFE molecules when the films are casted from diluted solutions. In agreement, corresponding disorder in terms of Urbach energy shows a decreasing trend upon inclusion of more and more PCTFE molecules. Micro-Raman spectra are dominated by fluorescence background, which is proposed as arising from degraded PCTFE. Supporting this, FTIR spectra also shows modifications in bonding as a function of PCTFE percentage, but this bond modification is not enough to produce refractive index variation in the sample, which is dominated by the host PMMA contribution for all the PCTFE concentrations. The study suggests the useful range of PCTFE concentration in which PMMA host properties can be modified for optimizing optical and structural properties without much degradation of PCTFE. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This paper mainly focuses on the influence of transverse magnetic field as well as thermal radiation on three-dimensional free convective flow of nanofluid over a linear stretching sheet. One remarkable aspect of this study is that a new micro-convection model namely Patel model has been introduced in view of enhancement of thermal conductivity and hence more heat transfer capability of nanofluid. The non-linear partial differential equations have been converted into strong non-linear ordinary differential equations by employing suitable transformations and these transformed equations are solved by Runga-Kutta method of fourth order along with Shooting technique as well as Secant method for better approximation. From this study, it is found that the presence of magnetic field slows down the fluid motion while it enhances the fluid temperature leading to a reduction in heat transfer rate from the surface. It is also found that enhancing thermal radiation parameter causes a reduction in heat transfer rate. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

The image scrambling accomplished using the chaotic function with iterations along the length of the image to be scrambled. The Linear canonical transform (LCT) is used to encrypt all the three components of colour image i.e. Red, Green and Blue at the same time. Application of the LCT over these components makes to not affect each other. So the connections between Red, Green and Blue components is condensed in the encrypted components. The security of the colour image is increased using the proposed algorithm. Simulation results represents that the proposed algorithm is best suited for the colour image encryption as well it provide safety to various attacks. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Biomimetic propulsion mechanisms are increasingly being explored in engineering sciences. Peristalsis is one of the most efficient of these mechanisms and offers considerable promise in microscale fluidics. Electrokinetic peristalsis has recently also stimulated significant attention. Electrical and magnetic fields also offer an excellent mode for regulating flows. Motivated by novel applications in electro-conductive microchannel transport systems, the current article investigates analytically the electromagnetic pumping of non-Newtonian aqueous electrolytes via peristaltic waves in a two-dimensional microchannel with different peristaltic waves propagating at the upper and lower channel wall (complex wavy scenario). The Stokes couple stress model is deployed to capture micro-structural characteristics of real working fluids. The unsteady two-dimensional conservation equations for mass and momentum conservation, electro-kinetic and magnetic body forces, are formulated in two dimensional Cartesian co-ordinates. The transport equations are transformed from the wave frame to the laboratory frame and the electrical field terms rendered into electrical potential terms via the Poisson-Boltzmann equation, Debye length approximation and ionic Nernst Planck equation. The dimensionless emerging linearized electro-magnetic boundary value problem is solved using integral methods. The influence of Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity (characteristic electro-osmotic velocity), couple stress length parameter (measure of the polarity of the fluid), Hartmann magnetic number, and electro-osmotic parameter on axial velocity, volumetric flow rate, time-averaged flow rate and streamline distribution are visualized and interpreted at length. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Motivated by novel developments in surface-modified, nanoscale, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) biomedical devices, we study theoretically the ciliary induced transport by metachronal wave propagation in hydromagnetic flow of copper-water nanofluids through a parallel plate channel. Under the physiological constraints, creeping flow is taken into consideration i.e. inertial forces are small compared with viscous forces. The metachronal wavelength is also considered as very large for cilia induced MHD flow. Magnetic Reynolds number is sufficiently large to invoke magnetic induction effects. The physical problem is linearized and exact solutions are developed for the resulting boundary value problem. Closed-form expressions are presented for the stream function, pressure rise, induced magnetic field function and temperature. Mathematica symbolic software is used to compute and illustrate numerical results. The influence of physical parameters on velocity profile, pressure gradient and trapping of bolus are discussed with the aid of graphs. The present computations are applicable to simulations of flow control of in nano-magneto-biomimetic technologies. © 2017 The Physical Society of the Republic of China (Taiwan)},

abstract={The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of fiber orientation and ply stacking sequence of basalt-carbon hybrid composite laminates on the critical buckling strength, experimentally and by using nonlinear finite element analysis. The composite laminated plates are simply supported and subjected to axial compression load. Nonlinear FEA results using ANSYS have good agreement with the experimental results. FEA results showed that the outer layers have the most significant influence on the buckling strength of the composite laminated material. Furthermore, placing carbon fiber reinforced layers in the outer surface of the basalt-carbon/epoxy hybrid laminates results in significant increase in the critical buckling load compared to placing basalt fiber reinforced layers in the outer surface. It is also concluded that [0 2 C/0B/+45B] S laminate is the best combination of the hybrid stacking sequences as far as buckling strength is concerned. © 2017, National Institute of Science Communication and Information Resources (NISCAIR).

The surface-sterilized explants after staining with lactophenol cotton blue showed the presence of endophytic fungi in intercellular spaces of ground and dermal tissues. In transverse sections of leaf at 100* magnification, dense blue colonies of endophytic fungi in epidermis and mesophyll region were recorded, while sprinkled colonies were seen in vascular bundles. In transverse sections of stem at 100* magnification, dense colonies of endophytic fungi in phloem and slightly lesser in epidermal region were observed. Scattered colonies were also recorded in xylem and cortex tissues. The fungal colonies were also present in intracellular and extracellular regions of both explants. Further studies will be required to identify these fungal isolates through pure culture on PDA plates to explore their biosynthetic pathway.},

The entire structure is assumed to be grown over the GaAs substrate. In order to calculate the optical gain of the structure, first 4 × 4 Kohn-Luttinger Hamiltonian is solved to determine the sub-band dispersion and corresponding envelope wave functions; and then transition matrix elements calculations is designed to perform calculations of momentum matrix elements and dipole moments of selected transitions taking into account spin concept of the charge carriers. The calculated optical gain corresponding to maximum intensity meets at photonic energy ∼ 1.64 eV and at corresponding wavelength ∼ 756 nm. The maximum gain value corresponds to e1-hh1 transitions.

Being different from conventional broadside Magneto-Electric dipole antenna, this antenna has been excited by Z shaped feed line to impart end-fire radiation pattern. A wide impedance bandwidth of 23.9%, with 8.5dBi peak gain and 8.7dBi peak directivity has been achieved for the frequency range 12.2GHz-15.5GHz. Antenna efficiency of 90% and low cross polarization level for entire range of operation has also been observed. The antenna also exhibits low side lobe radiations and almost identical E plane and H plane radiation patterns in the given frequency range.

abstract={Tinospora cordifolia is a prioritized medicinal plant and having an immense medicinal importance especially in Indian medicinal system. But this plant needs a regeneration protocol for its rapid propagation. An efficient regeneration protocol was developed for T. cordifolia using nodal explants. High frequency of multiple shoot formation was induced when the nodal segments were cultured on MS medium supplemented with BAP (1.0 mg L−1) and 2-iP (0.5 mg L−1). The highest mean number of shoots per nodal explant (7.9 ± 0.45) with highest shoot length (9.3 ± 0.48 cm) and 86% response were achieved on this media and hormonal concentration. The optimum rooting was obtained on ½ strength of MS medium augmented with IBA (0.5 mg L−1) with 8.3 ± 0.46 cm root length and 89% response. Micropropagated plantlets were found to be identical with the mother plant when clonal fidelity of these plantlets were analyzed with inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) marker. The berberine content was analyzed through LCMS QToF and the highest amount was found in in vitro callus (19.8 µg/gm) followed by stem (9.3 µg/gm) and leaves of field-grown plants (8.4 µg/gm). Further, presence of berberine was confirmed by ESI–MS spectra with protonated molecular ions ([M + H]+) at m/z 336. Furthermore, MS–MS fragmentation pattern confirmed for the presence of berberine in both the samples. Both the spectra (standard and samples) showed common peaks for berberine in the form of protonated molecular ions ([M + H]+) at m/z 320, m/z 304, m/z 292, m/z 278 in MS/MS mode. The study revealed that developed protocol is potent for rapid mass propagation of this plant species with high accumulation of important secondary metabolite berberine. © 2017, The Author(s).},

abstract={A mathematical model is developed to analyze electro-kinetic effects on unsteady peristaltic transport of blood in cylindrical vessels of finite length. The Newtonian viscous model is adopted. The analysis is restricted under Debye-Hückel linearization (i.e., wall zeta potential ≤ 25mV) is sufficiently small). The transformed, nondimensional conservation equations are derived via lubrication theory and long wavelength and the resulting linearized boundary value problem is solved exactly. The case of a thin electric double layer (i.e., where only slip electro-osmotic velocity considered) is retrieved as a particular case of the present model. The response in pumping characteristics (axial velocity, pressure gradient or difference, volumetric flow rate, local wall shear stress) to the influence of electro-osmotic effect (inverse Debye length) and Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity is elaborated in detail. Visualization of trapping phenomenon is also included and the bolus dynamics evolution with electro-kinetic effects examined. A comparative study of train wave propagation and single wave propagation is presented under the effects of thickness of EDL and external electric field. The study is relevant to electrophoresis in haemotology, electrohydrodynamic therapy and biomimetic electro-osmotic pumps. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={This paper presents the results of an experimental investigation of the strength, permeability, abrasion, carbonation, and shrinkage characteristics of concrete containing various percentages of copper tailing as partial replacement of natural fine aggregates. M 25 Grade concrete was designed as per specific national specifications. Copper tailing was used to replace natural sand in the range of 0-80%. It was observed that the copper-tailing concrete with up to 80% substitution exhibited a comparable compressive and flexural strength when compared to the control specimens. From the abrasion test, it was noted that the specimens could be implemented in general-purpose and heavy-duty floor tiles. The shrinkage strains, water permeability, and carbonation of copper-tailing concrete were observed to be increasing with increasing replacement amounts of copper tailing. The concrete containing copper tailing replacing up to 70% of natural fine aggregates could be recommended for all applications, and substitution levels beyond 70% could be recommended for nonstructural applications, pavements, etc. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

The compounds were characterised by elemental analyses, FT-IR and NMR (1H, 27Al &amp; 51V) spectral studies. The desired single-phase aluminium vanadate, AlVO4, (a &amp; b) have been obtained easily from the precursors, (1) and (2), respectively, by the sol-gel process. Formation of triclinic phase in both of the AlVO4 (a &amp; b) samples was confirmed by powder XRD patterns. SEM image of (b) exhibits formation of nano-grains with agglomers like surface morphologies. Composition of AlVO4 sample (b) was investigated by EDX analysis, which shows presence of aluminium and vanadium in 1:1 atomic ratio.

abstract={A low voltage self-biased high swing cascode current mirror (SHCCM) with improved bandwidth has been proposed. The recently reported SHCCM architecture use the bulk-driven quasi-floating gate (BDQFG) MOS transistors to enhance the effective transconductance which improves the current mirror input resistance and bandwidth range over the same architecture realized using bulk-driven MOS transistors. To further improve the bandwidth the proposed BDQFG based SHCCM uses two resistances which makes the current mirror frequency response free from input capacitors and also reduces the parasitic capacitance effect which results in increased bandwidth with an advantage of having no degradation in other performance parameters of current mirror. The proposed current mirror operates well for input current range from 0 to 200 μA with good linearity and shows the bandwidth of 298 MHz (i.e., 1.6 times over prior reported BDQFG based SHCCM). The observed input and output resistance is 306 Ω and 165 kΩ, respectively. Further, the THD analysis is carried to prove the robustness of proposed current mirror. The complete analysis is performed on UMC 0.18 μm technology using HSpice.},

abstract={A mathematical model is developed for electro-osmotic peristaltic pumping of a non-Newtonian liquid in a deformable micro-channel. Stokes' couple stress fluid model is employed to represent realistic working liquids. The Poisson-Boltzmann equation for electric potential distribution is implemented owing to the presence of an electrical double layer (EDL) in the micro-channel. Using long wavelength, lubrication theory and Debye-Huckel approximations, the linearized transformed dimensionless boundary value problem is solved analytically. The influence of electro-osmotic parameter (inversely proportional to Debye length), maximum electro-osmotic velocity (a function of external applied electrical field) and couple stress parameter on axial velocity, volumetric flow rate, pressure gradient, local wall shear stress and stream function distributions is evaluated in detail with the aid of graphs. The Newtonian fluid case is retrieved as a special case with vanishing couple stress effects. With increasing the couple stress parameter there is a significant increase in the axial pressure gradient whereas the core axial velocity is reduced. An increase in the electro-osmotic parameter both induces flow acceleration in the core region (around the channel centreline) and it also enhances the axial pressure gradient substantially. The study is relevant in the simulation of novel smart bio-inspired space pumps, chromatography and medical micro-scale devices. © 2017, Società Italiana di Fisica and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={The Inhomogeneous plasma with positive ions and electrons in which collisions are taking place is considered. To include the modification due to the magnetized plasma, a static magnetic field B0 is considered to be applied in the z-direction and the wave propagation is taken at an angle θ with it in the (X, Z) plane. The ions are assumed to be cold and singly charged. Fluid equations which take into account the recombination effects are formulated for ions and the electrons. Potential is found from Poisson's equation using normal mode analysis (NMA) along with linear approximation, neglecting higher order perturbed terms. From Potential equation, dispersion relation is generated which is solved numerically for obtaining the value of ω using typical plasma parameters. The behavior of growth rate with magnetic field, propagation angle, recombination constant along with different plasma oscillation wavelength to Debye length ratio (λ / λDe) has been studied. Two types of instabilities has been observed. Both the instabilities showing the same behavior with respect to recombination constant, magnetic field and (λ / λDe) plasma oscillation wavelength to Debye wavelength ratio. But they behave opposite to each other with respect to propagation angle (angle between the magnetic field and the propagation vector). © 2017 Author(s).},

abstract={Isotropic Compton profiles of transition metal based ceramics TaB and VB have been measured using 137Cs (661.65 keV) γ-ray Compton spectrometer. The experimental momentum densities are compared with those deduced using linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) with Hartree-Fock (HF), density functional theory (DFT) with Wu-Cohen generalized gradient approximation (WCGGA) and also the hybridization of HF and DFT (namely B3PW and PBE0) schemes. It is found that LCAO-DFT-WCGGA scheme based profiles give an overall better agreement with the experimental data, for both the borides. In addition, we have computed the Mulliken's population (MP) charge transfer data, energy bands, density of states and Fermi surface topology of both the borides using full potential-linearized augmented plane wave (FP-LAPW) and LCAO methods with DFT-WCGGA scheme. Cross-overs of Fermi level by the energy bands corresponding to B-2p and valence d-states of transition metals lead to metallic character in both the compounds. Equal-valence-electron-density profiles and MP analysis suggest more ionic character of VB than that of TaB. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

It was concluded that though not much harm has happened to the underground water in any of these locations but the same was not fit for drinking either. Out of the 3 locations, Bagru had the worst situation followed by Sanganer and Muhana. The unit successfully eliminated arsenic and lead fully and achieved about 75% reduction in fluoride, chloride and turbidity.

abstract={Passive cooling is a building design approach that focuses on heat gain control and heat dissipation in a building in order to improve the indoor thermal comfort with low or nil energy consumption. Appropriate air temperature distribution in a room is necessary for thermal comfort. By using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) it is possible to compare optional ways of air supply for maintaining thermal comfort in a conditioned zone equipped with passive cooling like EATHE. Using these simulations, designer can choose the best method of air supply in the room diminishing the risk of an incorrect solution. This paper compares three cases in which integration of active (AC) and passive (EATHE) cooling was analysed with the help of CFD tool. The uniform heat flux from the surface was set to 55 W/m2, AC air velocity of 3 m/s and supply temperature kept constant at 291 K. k-E model was considered for the turbulence model. Results was analysed and it was concluded that minimum time taken and maximum temperature drop was achieved with the installation of both the equipment on the same side of the room. © 2017 The Authors.},

abstract={The Variable Refrigerant Flow (VRF) technology has emerged as promising alternative to conventional systems, especially for small residential and commercial buildings which are largely untouched in regard to the energy efficiency of space conditioning systems despite the huge energy saving potential. This study aims to find out whether VRF split system provides an energy efficient and viable retrofit option for this sector. This paper compares the performance of an inverter based VRF Unitary AC with Constant Volume Unitary AC using the field performance testing. Both systems were installed in two geometrically and thermally identical rooms, with 14.5 m2 floor area each. Observations were made in the months of January to May, the systems were operated from 10 AM to 6 PM, auxiliary heating was also provided to vary the zone internal load conditions; the auxiliary heat load provided by the electrical heaters was 2 kW and 4 kW. The results were analyzed and it was found that the VRF technology is energy saving only when it works on part load conditions; minimum (negative) savings were observed when the outdoor temperature was equal to the rated outdoor DBT i.e. when the system was operating at full load conditions while maximum savings i.e. 40% were observed when the outdoor DBT is nearly equal to the indoor set point temperature. © 2017 The Authors.},

abstract={With rising population, development, and environmental pollution, availability of potable water is shrinking fast. Thus, it is required to focus on the distillation of available water. Solar Still is one of the promising technologies available to purify water because of its low cost, energy, and skill requirement. However, the efficiency of present technology is low, so it is required to advance the designs of existing solar stills. In this study, a multi-phase three-dimensional CFD model of a simple solar still developed for simulation with using ANSYS FLUENT. The simulation has been done for transient state to validate the results with experimental data for climate conditions of Jaipur (26°13'N, 75°49'E). Within the scope of this study, simulation results were found to be in good agreement with the experimental data. It is also examined that thermal efficiency of the Solar Still is higher from 16:00 to 17:00 hrs. Parametric analyses has been done to enhance the productivity of Solar Still. Different materials were used in the basin to increase the heat capacity, absorption capacity and the evaporation rate. The impact of varying the depth of the basin water was also studied. It has been found that the Solar Still have more productivity for low water depth. © 2017 The Authors.},

abstract={In the present work, we report exchange bias tuning by varying thin film deposition parameters such as synthesis method and underlying layer patterning. The patterned substrates for this study were prepared by self-assembly of polystyrene (PS) latex spheres (~530 nm) on Si (100) substrate. The desired magnetic nanocaps composed of CoO/Co bilayer film on these patterned substrates were prepared by molecular beam epitaxy technique under ultra-high vacuum conditions. For this, a Co layer of ~10 nm thickness was deposited on the substrates and then oxidized in-situ to form CoO/Co/PS in-situ oxidized film or ex-situ in ambiance which also gives CoO/Co/PS naturally oxidized film. Simultaneously, reference thin films of Co (~10 nm) were also prepared on plane Si substrate and similar oxidation treatments were performed on them respectively. The magnetic properties studied using SQUID technique revealed higher exchange bias (~1736 Oe) in the in-situ oxidized Co/PS film as compared to that in naturally oxidized Co/PS film (~1544 Oe) and also compared to the reference film. The observed variations in the magnetic properties are explained in terms of surface patterning induced structural changes of the deposited films and different oxidation methods. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={A mathematical model to simulate oxygen delivery through a capillary to tissues under the influence of an external force field is presented. The multi-term general fractional diffusion equation containing force terms and a time dependent absorbent term is taken into account. Fractional calculus is applied to describe the phenomenon of sub-diffusion of oxygen in both transverse and longitudinal directions. A new computational algorithm, i.e., the new iterative method (NIM) is employed to solve the spatio-temporal fractional partial differential equation subject to appropriate physical boundary conditions. Validation of NIM solutions is achieved with a modified adomian decomposition method (MADM). A parametric study is conducted for three loading scenarios on the capillary-radial force alone, axial force alone and the combined case of both forces. The results demonstrate that the force terms markedly influence the oxygen diffusion process. For example, the radial force exerts a more profound effect than axial force on sub-diffusion of oxygen indicating that careful manipulation of these forces on capillary-tissues may assist in the effective reduction of hypoxia or other oxygen depletion phenomena. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={The transport of single-wall carbon nanotube (CNT) nanofluids with temperature-dependent variable viscosity is analyzed by peristaltically driven flow. The main flow problem has been modeled using cylindrical coordinates and flow equations are simplified to ordinary differential equations using long wavelength and low Reynolds' number approximation. Analytical solutions have been obtained for axial velocity, pressure gradient and temperature. Results acquired are discussed graphically for better understanding. It is observed that with an increment in the Grashof number the velocity of the governing fluids starts to decrease significantly and the pressure gradient is higher for pure water as compared to single-walled carbon nanotubes due to low density. As the specific heat is very high for pure water as compared to the multi-wall carbon nanotubes, it raises temperature of the muscles, in the case of pure water, as compared to the multi-walled carbon nanotubes. Furthermore, it is noticed that the trapped bolus starts decreasing in size as the buoyancy forces are dominant as compared to viscous forces. This model may be applicable in biomedical engineering and nanotechnology to design the biomedical devices. © 2017, Società Italiana di Fisica and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={The present investigation focusses on a mathematical study of creeping viscous flow induced by metachronal wave propagation in a horizontal ciliated tube containing porous media. Creeping flow limitations are imposed, i.e. inertial forces are small compared to viscous forces and therefore a very low Reynolds number (Re 1) is taken into account. The wavelength of metachronal wave is also considered to be very large for cilia movement. The physical problem is linearized and exact solutions are developed for the differential equation problem. Mathematica software is used to compute and illustrate numerical results. The influence of slip parameter and Darcy number on velocity profile, pressure gradient and trapping of bolus are discussed with the aid of graphs. It is found that with increasing magnitude of the slip parameter, the trapped bolus inside the streamlines increases in size. The study is relevant to biological propulsion of medical micromachines in drug delivery.},

This has necessitated a comprehensive approach in planning the expansion ofthe system with the incorporation of DG units for effective and reliable operation of the system. In this study, a robustHybrid Islanding Detection Technique (HIDT) has been proposed for identifying the islanding event early and accuratelyin the distribution networks with DGs installed by a two-step Genetic Algorithm (GA) process. As the reliability ofpower supply to the customer is of utmost importance, a priority-based load shedding scheme is proposed. Theproposed load shedding scheme sheds only the vulnerable loads in the island for regaining the frequency and voltagestabilities. By the proposed methods, a comprehensive solution for system planning and emergency control actionscan be obtained for effective operation of the system with DG units. The proposed methods are investigated onstandard IEEE 33 and 69 bus distribution systems under different loading conditions. The results obtained show thatthe proposed methods are able to identify the islanding event more effectively and also regain the stability in theisland with less amount of load shedding. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2016.},

abstract={Integration of Distributed Generation (DG) in electric power networks poses complexities and challenges to the system operator. The DGs can provide positive impact on the operation of the system if located and cited properly. This paper proposes the DG (Type I and Type III) placement and sizing algorithm to reduce system losses and improve the voltage profile of the system. Modal analysis and Continuous Power Flow (CPF) are used to determine the candidate buses for the DG placement. A voltage stability constrained optimal sizing of DG is obtained using Genetic Algorithm (GA). The superiority of the proposed algorithm has been verified by the various performance indices. The performance of the proposed methodology is investigated on standard IEEE-33 and IEEE-69 bus radial distribution system. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents a hybrid fuzzy sliding mode controller for control of speed in a BLDC motor drive. For the most part, Brushless DC motors have been utilized as a part of different modern and local applications due to its favorable characteristics such as straightforward structure, extensive torque, long utilize time, great speed regulation. However the BLDC motor frameworks have questionable and nonlinear attributes which corrupt execution of controllers. Sliding mode controllers (SMC) are very useful in controlling the non-linearities in the system. But due to the effect of chattering in SMC based drives, the use of controller is limited. Henceforth a novel hybrid fuzzy sliding mode controller is exhibited in this paper for effectively reducing the chattering effect. Simulation study is carried out in MATLAB so as to validate the performance of the said scheme. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Effort estimation plays a pivotal role for planning the development of any software applications. When there is a need of developing web-based applications, the need of proper estimation of its effort is considered to be very essential. Web-based software projects are different than conventional projects, and hence the task of estimation is a complex one. It is observed that the literature does not provide a guidance to the analysts to use a particular model for effort estimation of this type of applications. A number of models like IFPUG Function Point Model, NESMA, MARK-II, etc. are being considered for effort estimation of web-based applications. The efficiency of these models can be improved by employing certain intelligent techniques on them. This study considers the application of various machine learning techniques such as K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Constrained Topological Mapping (CTM), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) and Classification and Regression Tree (CART) for effort estimation of web-based applications using IFPUG Function Point approach. The ISBSG dataset, Release 12 has been considered in this study for obtaining the IFPUG Function Point data. The effectiveness of these machine learning techniques-based effort estimation models is assessed with the help of certain metrics, in order to evaluate performance of desired web-based applications. © 2017 ACM.},

Energy bands and density of states (DOS) computations are performed using different flavors of exchange and correlations. The calculations are performed using Wu-Cohen generalized gradient approximation (WC-GGA), Perdew et al. (PBE-sol) and the most accurate modified Becke and Johnson (mBJ) potentials. Our investigations show that energy bands and DOS computed using mBJ potential are in better agreement with the available experimental data. Optical properties such as, dielectric tensor components, absorption spectra, reflectivity, refractivity, dielectric loss, are investigated using mBJ potential. Imaginary peaks of di-electric tensor ε2(ω), are interpreted by means of inter-band transitions from valence to conduction band. High intensity absorption curves from 3 to 5 eV, energy band gap depicted for ZnGa2Te4 (1.61 eV) and CdGa2Te4 (1.78 eV) materials indicates their applicability for solar photovoltaic and other optoelectronic applications. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This paper presents an analytical study of magnetohydrodynamics and convective heat transfer of nanofluids synthesized by three different shaped (brick, platelet and cylinder) silver (Ag) nanoparticles in water. A two-phase nanoscale formulation is adopted which is more appropriate for biophysical systems. The flow is induced by metachronal beating of cilia and the flow geometry is considered as a cylindrical tube. The analysis is carried out under the low Reynolds number and long wavelength approximations and the fluid and cilia dynamics is of the creeping type. A Lorentzian magnetic body force model is employed and magnetic induction effects are neglected. Solutions to the transformed boundary value problem are obtained via numerical integration. The influence of cilia length parameter, Hartmann (magnetic) number, heat absorption parameter, Grashof number (free convection), solid nanoparticle volume fraction, and cilia eccentricity parameter on the flow and heat transfer characteristics (including effective thermal conductivity of the nanofluid) are examined in detail. Furthermore a comparative study for different nanoparticle geometries (i.e. bricks, platelets and cylinders) is conducted. The computations show that pressure increases with enhancing the heat absorption, buoyancy force (i.e. Grashof number) and nanoparticle fraction however it reduces with increasing the magnetic field. The computations also reveal that pressure enhancement is a maximum for the platelet nano-particle case compared with the brick and cylinder nanoparticle cases. Furthermore the quantity of trapped streamlines for cylinder type nanoparticles exceeds substantially that computed for brick and platelet nanoparticles, whereas the bolus magnitude (trapped zone) for brick nanoparticles is demonstrably greater than that obtained for cylinder and platelet nanoparticles. The present model is applicable in biological and biomimetic transport phenomena exploiting magnetic nanofluids and ciliated inner tube surfaces. © 2016 The Society of Powder Technology Japan},

LPS is the most developed Lean Construction tool used in improving work plans and control of projects. The work described in this paper presents results of an ongoing construction project in closing phase. It focuses on contractor's implementation of LPS to analyze how lean construction techniques improve performance and productivity. To achieve this, action research model was undertaken. The research was carried out in a Bishop Heber college construction site, where multipurpose buildings were being constructed by a sole contractor. A comparison-based survey was conducted with construction professionals to identify current practices and exposure LPS has in India. The results reveal that implementing LPS had significant improvements over traditional management and a notable increase in average Percentage Plan Completed. This progress was enabled by the way the site was planned, managed and controlled using LPS. The paper concludes by discussing ing results of implementing LPS, including benefits, barriers, and the critical success factors for this project. However, there were some potential barriers reported which hinder the achieving full potential of LPS. © IAEME Publication.},

abstract={In recent years, major industrial sectors such as automotive, aerospace, building, biomedical, and others have increasingly been employing polymer composites for structural applications, but these polymers are known to exhibit poor adhesion characteristics owing to their low surface free energy (SFE) and lack of polar functional groups on their surfaces. This chapter discusses the effect of modifying polymer surfaces by different plasma techniques on the SFE and surface roughness of the polymers, which play an important role in improving adhesive bond strength. This chapter highlights the importance of plasma for surface activation of polymer composites to form structural parts using adhesive bonding for high-end applications. The chapter is divided into five sections. Section 3.1 gives an introduction to the chapter. Section 3.2 gives a brief summary of the adhesives being used for high-end applications. Section 3.3 gives a detailed overview of the adhesion phenomenon, its mechanisms, wetting, adhesion in polymer systems, and the need for surface modification.

abstract={Due to diverse applications in the field of science and engineering, study of bi-metallic nano alloy clusters is very much popular. Among such nano clusters, the compound formed between Cu-Ag has gained considerable interest because of their unique optical, electronic and magnetic properties. Density functional theory (DFT) is one of the most popular techniques of quantum mechanics to study the electronic properties of materials. Conceptual DFT-based descriptors are indispensable tools to correlate the experimental properties of nano compounds and composites. In this report, we have studied CuAgn; (n = 1-8) nano alloy clusters within theoretical framework of DFT at B3LYP level. The calculated nano alloy clusters show interesting odd-even oscillation behaviors, indicating even number of clusters show higher stability as compare to their neighbor odd number clusters. A close agreement between experimental bond length and computed data also reflect in this analysis. © 2018 by Apple Academic Press, Inc.},

abstract={This paper deals with unsteady oscillatory flow of viscous incompressible fluid with heat & mass transfer in a horizontal channel partially occupied by porous medium following the Darcy-Brinkman model. The inner territory of the channel consists of two regions; one of them is filled with porous material and second is clear fluid. At the porous medium fluid interface, interfacial coupling conditions for the fluid velocity, temperature and concentration were used to derive the analytical solution. Some standard values of Schmidt number like Hydrogen(0.22), Helium(0.30), Amonia(0.78); Eckert number (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2) and Prandtl number for water(0.71) and Air(7.0) was considered in this paper. The effects of pertinent physical fluid parameter like porosity, viscosity ratio, density ratio etc. on velocity, temperature and concentration distribution are considered and demonstrated through graphs. Heavier diffusive species and high molecular diffusivity ratio decreases the fluid concentration throughout the region. Increasing values of Prandtl number upsurge the fluid temperature throughout the region. © 2017 ANAME Publication. All rights reserved.},

abstract={With the advancement in technology and the rising need to remain connected to the Internet even while on the move, Network Mobility (NEMO) has come into existence. It is an extension of mobile IPv6 which enables a set of nodes to collectively move from one place to another without disrupting their connection to the Internet. In hierarchical NEMO, due to the high degree of nesting in mobile network, pinball routing problem, inefficient route and end to end delay in packet transmission are quite common. Therefore, considering these problems, we have come up with a solution called Route Optimization for Inter and Intra Network (ROIIN) which will provide one tunnel solution in case of inter-network packet transmission and an efficient route optimization in case of intra-network communications. The proposed solution is simulated in NS2 and the observed results of our simulation shows better efficiency as compared to the existing solutions. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, London.},

The server is subject to sudden halt while in normal busy period and immediately after repair process, its service resumes. The server failure and server repair follow the exponential distributions. Once the system becomes vacant, the server takes functioning vacation during which the customer waiting in the queue tends to renege and server serves the customer at a lower rate. The steady state probabilities are obtained in terms of transition rates of inflow and outflow processes by means of matrix geometric approach. Various measures of performance of the model are determined in terms of system state probabilities. Further impact of model parameters on these measures are shown graphically with the help of numerical illustration.},

abstract={The inventive use of language in different areas by humans makes them creative and innovative. The use of innovative language in advertisements is to hold the attention of consumers and to motivate them to purchase different products. They (advertisers) use different and updated language techniques in advertising; one of them is code mixing (CM), which refers to the mixing of words from different languages in a systematic pattern. This paper intended to provide the role and impact of code • mixing in advertising in India through the interviews conducted from 100 individuals. This will result in understanding the concept of code - mixing from the perspective of 'global advertising strategy'. Additionally, it would help in understanding the cultural identities of other regions and 'social responsibilities'. The results obtained from lexical analysis of code mixed advertisements and readers' attitudinal surveys showed that the linguistic factors of advertisements are designed keeping multilingual reader's psychology in mind. Advertisers strategically utilize their linguistic creativity by including different symbolic meanings in their creative linguistic repertoire. It helps in keeping the product memorable. In order to fulfil the purpose of the study, quantitative approach was used to check whether code mixing in advertisements works as a successful language strategy in having imprints on consumers' minds. The paper provides new explanations using exploratory and descriptive analysis that would be helpful as an evidence to enhance the quality of communication in marketing. It will further provide insights to the advertisers forthe development of new marketing policies.},

abstract={Indian Railways (IR) which is a vertically integrated organization under Ministry of Railways is in urgent need of reforms. It has been discussed since long that the current organizational structure of IR is a major deterrent for its commercial orientation, promoting competition and providing a level playing field to other players in the sector. As a result, private investments in the sector have been negligible in spite of several attempts made by the Ministry of Railways. Indian policy makers have been apprehensive about vertical unbundling citing negative experiences from British Railways. The authors believe that given the framework that vertical unbundling provides for leveraging private investments and operational efficiencies, it should be explored as an option for IR. This paper is an attempt in this direction wherein the unbundling of policy making, infrastructure and services is explored. Authors have studied the German Railway Reform in depth and explored the implications of similar unbundling for IR.},

A three dimensional rectangular slot loaded dielectric (Alteration of Dielectric Substrate) of the antenna for dual-band (S & C) operation has been proposed for remote sensing applications. In this paper, first a single layer convexo-concave patch antenna with a concave bow tie slot is designed and analyzed. Then a superstrate layer is introduced with this antenna. A comparative study between the single layer and multilayer convexo-concave patch antenna is done and it is observed that after the application of a superstrate layer with alteration of dielectric substrate the antenna resonates at two different frequencies 3.17 GHz and 5.34 GHz with a bandwidth of 7% and 17% respectively. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, the optoelectronic nature of the CdGa2 X4 (X = S, Se) solar cell materials are examined using full potential linear augmented plane wave (FP-LAPW) method as embodied in WIEN2K code. In present computation, we have used most suitable modified Backe-Johnson (mBJ) potential under the framework of density functional theory (DFT). The calculated electronic properties like energy band structure and density of states spectra show that these materials exhibit a direct band gap (Γ–Γ) result of 3.22 eV and 2.36 eV for CdGa2 S4 and CdGa2 Se4 compounds, respectively. Absorption spectra for CdGa2 X4 (X = S, Se) compounds have been studied and it has been found that above the band gap, absorption are taking place and it covers wide visible spectrum energy range. On the basis of calculated band gap, density of states and absorption coefficient spectra, it is found that these compounds can be suitably applicable in optoelectronic devices such as solar cell.

abstract={The present article studies theoretically the electrokinetic pumping of nanofluids with heat and mass transfer in a micro-channel under peristaltic waves, a topic of some interest in medical nano-scale electro-osmotic devices. The microchannel walls are deformable and transmit periodic waves. The Chakraborty-Roy nanofluid electrokinetic formulation is adopted in which Joule heating effects are incorporated. Soret and Dufour cross-diffusion effects are also considered. Under low Reynolds number (negligible inertial effects), long wavelength and Debye linearization approximations, the governing partial differential equations for mass, momentum, energy and solute concentration conservation are derived with appropriate boundary conditions at the micro-channel walls. The merging model features a number of important thermo-physical, electrical and nanoscale parameter, namely thermal and solutal Grashof numbers, the Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity (maximum electro-osmotic velocity) and Joule heating to surface heat flux ratio. Closed-form solutions are derived for the solute concentration, temperature, axial velocity, averaged volumetric flow rate, pressure difference across one wavelength, and stream function distribution in the wave frame. Additionally expressions are presented for the surface shear stress function at the wall (skin friction coefficient), wall heat transfer rate (Nusselt number) and wall solute mass transfer rate (Sherwood number). The influence of selected parameters on these flow variables is studied with the aid of graphs. Bolus formation is also visualized and analyzed in detail. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Purpose - The purpose of this study is to analyze magnetohydrodynamic three-dimensional flow of Casson nanofluid over a stretching sheet in presence of thermophoresis and Brownian motion effects. In contrast, the convective surface boundary conditions with the effects of radiation are applied. Design/methodology/approach - The governing partial differential equations are transformed into highly nonlinear coupled ordinary differential equations consisting of the momentum, energy and nanoparticle concentration via suitable similarity transformations, which are then solved the using optimal homotopy analysis method (OHAM) a Mathematica Package BVPh2.0. Findings - The influence of emerging physical flow parameters on fluid velocity component, temperature distribution and nanoparticle concentration are discussed in detail. Also, anOHAM solution demonstrates very good correlation with those obtained in the previously published results. It is noticed that OHAM can overcome the earlier restriction, assumptions and limitation of traditional perturbation method. The main advantage of this method is that OHAM can be applied directly to nonlinear differential equations without using linearization and round-off errors, and therefore, it cannot be affected by error associated to discretization. Originality/value - Here the approximate solutions are compared with the numerical results published in earlier work. © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The synthesized sensor molecules exhibit significant red shift in their absorption spectra with visual color changes on interaction with Cu(II) and Zn(II) ions. In addition, the optimized sensor showed excellent selectivity towards Cu(II) and Zn(II) ions with fluorescence “turn off” and “turn on” modes respectively. Along with this, anion recognition studies were carried out using UV-visible and fluorescence spectrophotometric titrations which revealed that synthesized sensors also exhibit selective sensing of F−, CH3COO− and H2PO4 − ions via H-bond interaction and subsequent deprotonation to elicit distinct visual color change from light yellow to orange with significant quenching in its emission intensity. Furthermore, the in-situ prepared sensor-anion adduct solution exhibited colorimetric “On-Off” sensing of Cu(II) and Zn(II) ions, which was confirmed through UV-visible titration experiments. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

abstract={Analytical solutions are developed for the electro-kinetic flow of a viscoelastic biological liquid in a finite length cylindrical capillary geometry under peristaltic waves. The Jefferys’ non-Newtonian constitutive model is employed to characterize rheological properties of the fluid. The unsteady conservation equations for mass and momentum with electro-kinetic and Darcian porous medium drag force terms are reduced to a system of steady linearized conservation equations in an axisymmetric coordinate system. The long wavelength, creeping (low Reynolds number) and Debye–Hückel linearization approximations are utilized. The resulting boundary value problem is shown to be controlled by a number of parameters including the electro-osmotic parameter, Helmholtz–Smoluchowski velocity (maximum electro-osmotic velocity), and Jefferys’ first parameter (ratio of relaxation and retardation time), wave amplitude. The influence of these parameters and also time on axial velocity, pressure difference, maximum volumetric flow rate and streamline distributions (for elucidating trapping phenomena) is visualized graphically and interpreted in detail. Pressure difference magnitudes are enhanced consistently with both increasing electro-osmotic parameter and Helmholtz–Smoluchowski velocity, whereas they are only elevated with increasing Jefferys’ first parameter for positive volumetric flow rates. Maximum time averaged flow rate is enhanced with increasing electro-osmotic parameter, Helmholtz–Smoluchowski velocity and Jefferys’ first parameter. Axial flow is accelerated in the core (plug) region of the conduit with greater values of electro-osmotic parameter and Helmholtz–Smoluchowski velocity whereas it is significantly decelerated with increasing Jefferys’ first parameter. The simulations find applications in electro-osmotic (EO) transport processes in capillary physiology and also bio-inspired EO pump devices in chemical and aerospace engineering. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={An analytical investigation is presented to study the unsteady peristaltic transport of nanofluids. Three different geometries of nanoparticle viz bricks, cylinder and platelets are considered in our analysis. The flow geometry is taken as nonuniform channel of finite length to explore our model for wide range of biomedical applications. Exact solutions are obtained for the non-dimensional governing equations subject to physically realistic boundary conditions. The effects of nanoparticle shapes on effective thermal conductivity, axial velocity, transverse velocity, temperature, and pressure difference distributions along the length of non-uniform channel with variation of different flow parameters are discussed with the help of graphical illustrations. It is observed that platelet shaped nanoparticles carry maximum velocity whereas brick shaped nanoparticles are the best to enhance the thermal conductivity. An inherent property of peristaltic transport i.e. trapping is also discussed. This model is applicable in drugs delivery system where different geometries of drugs are delivered and it is also applicable to design a microperistaltic pump for transportation of nanofluids. © 2017 The Authors},

abstract={In many industrial situations, machines are subjected to random breakdowns. In this paper, we consider the asynchronous vacation policy for the multi-server machine repair problem with server breakdown and two types of spares. According to this policy, when a certain number of servers become idle at a service completion instant, the servers will take an asynchronous vacation of random length together. If the servers find no waiting failed unit in the system and the number of servers on vacation is less than the total number of servers, then these servers can take vacation individually and continue to take vacation if the vacation condition is satisfied. Each server is subject to breakdowns in working state only and can be repaired according to exponential service time distribution. Matrix geometric method is used to obtain the queue size distribution. Various performance measures viz. the expected number of the idle servers, busy servers and vacationing servers, etc. are determined. The sensitivity analysis is made to examine the effect of parameters on various performance measures. Copyright © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={This paper describes the performance of thermal storage integrated micro-cogeneration system based on single cylinder diesel engine. In addition to electricity generated from genset, waste heat from hot exhaust of diesel engine was used to heat water in a double pipe heat exchanger of 67.70 cm length with inside tube diameter of 3.81 cm and outside tube diameter of 5.08 cm. Additionally, a latent heat thermal energy storage system was also integrated with this cogeneration system. A shell and tube type heat exchanger of 346 mm diameter and 420 mm height with 45 tubes of 18 mm diameter each was designed and fabricated, to store thermal energy, in which Erythritol (C4H10O4) was used as phase changing material. The test results show that micro capacity (4.4 kW), stationary, single cylinder, diesel engine can be successfully utilized to simultaneously produce power as well as heating, and to also store thermal energy. Slight decrease in engine performance was observed when double pipe heat exchanger and latent heat thermal energy storage system was integrated with engine but the amount of energy which could be recovered was significant. Maximum percentage of energy saved was obtained at a load of 3.6 kW and was 15.2%. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Old engines (Euro III or earlier) produce more emissions, and it will be difficult to entirely stop their usage especially in developing and under-developed nations; hence, it is desired that appropriate emission reduction technologies are tested on such engines to analyze their feasibility and economical acceptability. While most such studies have been conducted on constant speed stationary engines and modern engines, this study tried to analyze the effectiveness of an uncoated wall-flow type ceramic diesel particulate filter on a Euro-I, water-cooled, direct injection, variable speed, compression ignition engine in a laboratory set-up in India. Also, this study focused on diesel particulate filter regeneration by two methods: active regeneration by diesel injection in the particulate filter using an electronic control unit and off-board regeneration by taking out and heating the diesel particulate filter in an electrical resistance furnace at 650 °C for 10 h. The results, in the form of smoke emission, NOx emission and engine performance, obtained using both the regeneration methods were analyzed, and conclusions were drawn. It was found that using diesel particulate filter, particulate matter emissions (smoke) were almost entirely eliminated. It was also found that off-board regeneration had numerous advantages compared to active regeneration. Since a furnace would be needed for off-board regeneration, an exchange process for diesel particulate filter is suggested. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={The work initially isolates and identifies the bacteria from pharmaceutical industrial wastewaters having amidase activity and then immobilizes and optimizes the reaction conditions adopting variants of batch, fed batch and continuous reactor system for maximum bioconversion of acetamide to acetohydroxamic acid. The maximum acyltransferase activity was obtained in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) with substrate concentration 0.850 mmoles of acetamide and 1.7 mmoles of hydroxylamine hydrochloride with resting cells 0.94 mg (cell dry weight) (0.322 Uml-1) for 20 min at 55 °C. It had showed broad substrate specificity. Acetamide was the best substrate followed by acetonitrile. Industrial wastewater contains a large number of metal ions thus in view of future application of this research for real pharmaceutical wastewater treatment, the effect of a various metal ions on the immobilized cells was studied. Among the various metal ions and inhibitors, AgNO3 had only severely affected the enzyme activity. The short operation time of the proposed process, coupled with the possibility of an enzyme reuse during several cycles, are effective tools to implement this economically competitive semi-continuous reactor for amide biodegradation in pharmaceutical wastewaters. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

abstract={Necessity of opening of energy gap in the band structure of, otherwise a zero gap semiconductor, graphene, is a must for its use in fabrication of high speed electronic devices. One such technique, for opening of energy gap in graphene, is by way of doping the pristine graphene with boron or nitrogen. Besides many important applications, to which B- and N-doped graphene has been put, the one very important for solving the global energy crisis is by way of its capacity for hydrogen storage. In this paper electronic structure of B- and N-doped graphene has been studied by using Density Functional Theory, as implemented in WIEN2K code. PBE-GGA (Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof 96) pseudo-potential is used for solving the Schrodinger equation in self-consistent manner and to account for the exchange and correlation effects through the use of Generalized Gradient Approximation. The band structure calculations reveal that whereas a band gap opens at the symmetry point K both for B- and N-doped graphene, the center of the gap (i.e., the Dirac point in pristine graphene) is shifted above the Fermi level by about 2.20 eV for B-doped graphene, and shifted down the Fermi level by about the same amount for N-doped graphene, when the doping level was kept 25% in each case. The energy gap opened was found to be about 0.30 eV for B-doped graphene and 0.45 eV for N-doped graphene. The linear dispersion characteristics obtained at Dirac point for pristine graphene, almost vanish for B-/N-doped graphene, due to symmetry breaking and opening of energy gap. The band structure and Density of States of B-/N-doped graphene are found also to depend on the choice of cell parameters. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

It was observed that microorganism allocated substrate between maintenance and growth in the form of maintenance coefficient. Which could be induced by endogenous respiration owing to high solids retention time (SRT), predation on bacteria, chemical toxicity, adverse environment, and viral attack on bacteria. The wastewater treatment process may experience one or more maintenance inducing factors; nevertheless, high SRT and prevailing environmental conditions are imminent and thus considered as primary maintenance (mp), while remaining are classified as secondary maintenance (ms). Average yield coefficient reduction at HDO was 32.7% and 28.2% compared to stoichiometric and at normal DO, respectively. The observed primary and secondary maintenance was 0.11gCOD/gVSS.d (±0.01) at an SRT of 25.2 d (±2.0) and 0.096 g 0.1 gCOD/gVSS.d (±0.045) at an SRT of 24.2 d (±3.6d), respectively. The results obtained under the study are not as precise as on pure culture and defined substrate, nevertheless, it gives an idea that how stress factors inducing maintenance need to be addressed more seriously and objectively while managing our efforts on sludge reduction. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},
