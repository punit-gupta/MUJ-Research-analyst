Abstract = {{This article emphasizes the need for an alternative index which
   considers sustainability of human development and formulates an index
   based on strong sustainability. The strong sustainability notion
   underlines the need for sustaining natural capital resembling ecological
   footprints and is superior to a weak sustainability criterion since
   natural capital cannot be substitutable to a wider extent for fostering
   sustainable human development. The Ecological Footprint Biocapacity
   Index (EFBI) constructed is used in formulating Sustainable Human
   Development Index (SHDI) along with the other components of UNDP HDI. A
   comparative analysis has been made to justify the Sustainability
   Assessment Index as an appropriate index than other available indices.
   Statistics applied on the UNDP HDI and the Sustainable HDI shows
   significant difference between the two. The goal is to logically justify
   the need for a suitable index which can capture human development in
   terms of its sustainability.}},

Abstract = {{The present report adds to the ongoing research on Si/Ge nanostructures
   by discussing the results obtained utilizing unique features of
   Synchrotron radiation (SR). Based on the structural and electronic
   properties of this system investigated in our earlier work, we have
   synthesized {[}Si(5 nm)/Ge(5 nm)](x)10 multilayers (MLS) and exposed it
   to a range of incident photon energies (utilizing synchrotron radiation)
   and at different incident angles for the photoemission spectroscopic
   measurements. It is shown how the interface features are enhanced
   simultaneously suppressing the signals from topmost atomic layers. Also
   the effect of incident angle variation is discussed, which gives a clear
   picture of interface electronic properties of Si/Ge system. Significant
   changes in Si 3p, Ge 4p and s band features are observed in the valence
   band density of states. The overall results present an interesting
   observation of thoroughly investigating the basic building bilayer stack
   of the multilayer structure by combining energy and/or angle variation
   with low energy sputter depth profiling. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Study of status of safe injection practice and knowledge regarding
   injection safety among primary health care workers in Baglung district,
   western Nepal}},
Journal = {{BMC INTERNATIONAL HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{JAN 3}},
Abstract = {{Background: Unsafe injection practices and injection overuse are
   widespread in developing countries harming the patient and inviting
   risks to the health care workers. In Nepal, there is a dearth of
   documented information about injection practices so the present study
   was carried out: a) to determine whether the selected government health
   facilities satisfy the conditions for safe injections in terms of staff
   training, availability of sterile injectable equipment and their proper
   disposal after use and b) to assess knowledge and attitudes of
   healthcare workers in these health care facilities with regard to
   injection safety.
   Methodology: A descriptive cross-sectional mixed type (qualitative and
   quantitative) survey was carried out from 18th May to 16th June 2012.
   In-depth interviews with the in-charges were conducted using a
   semi-structured questionnaire. Observation of the health facilities
   using a structured observation tool was done. The data were analysed
   manually by summarizing, tabulating and presenting in various formats.
   Results: The in-charges (eight males, two females) who participated in
   the study ranged in age from 30 to 50 years with a mean age of 37.8
   years. Severe infection followed by pain was the most important cause
   for injection use with injection Gentamicin being most commonly
   prescribed. New single use (disposable) injections and auto-disable
   syringes were used to inject curative drugs and vaccines respectively.
   Sufficient safety boxes were also supplied to dispose the used syringe.
   All health care workers had received full course of Hepatitis B vaccine
   and were knowledgeable about at least one pathogen transmitted through
   unsafe injection practices. Injection safety management policy and waste
   disposal guideline was not available for viewing in any of the
   facilities. The office staff who disposed the bio-medical wastes did so
   without taking any safety measures. Moreover, none of these staff had
   received any formal training in waste management.
   Conclusions: Certain safe injection practices were noticed in the
   studied health care facilities but there remain a number of grey areas
   where unsafe practices still persists placing patient and health workers
   at risk of associated hazards. Training concentrating on injection
   safety, guidelines to dispose biomedical waste and monitoring of the
   activity is needed.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{The electronic structure and electron momentum density distribution in
   BaO and BaS are presented using Compton spectroscopy. The first-ever
   Compton profile measurements on polycrystalline BaO and BaS were
   performed using 59.54 keV gamma-rays. To interpret the experimental
   data, we have computed the theoretical Compton profiles of BaO and BaS
   using the linear combination of atomic orbitals method. In the present
   computation, the correlation scheme proposed by Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof
   and the exchange scheme of Becke were considered. The hybrid B3PW and
   Hartree-Fock based profiles were also computed for both compounds. The
   ionic configurations are performed to estimate the charge transfer on
   compound formation, and the present study suggests charge transfer from
   Ba to O and S atoms. On the basis of equal-valence-electron-density
   profiles, it is found that BaO is more ionic as compared to BaS.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MAGNETISM AND MAGNETIC MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{326}},
Pages = {{97-102}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Exchange bias results are reported on Co/Co nanotriangles prepared by
   depositing ultra-thin (10 nm) ferromagnetic Co film using molecular beam
   epitaxy on polystyrene nanospheres (530 nm). Then the surface was
   exposed to oxygen under high vacuum conditions to form antiferromagnetic
   CoO layer on top. After liftoff of these nanospheres, well defined
   triangles array was seen. For comparison, a similar film was
   simultaneously deposited on plane Si (100) substrate. Magnetization
   measurements carried out at room temperature with different orientations
   of magnetic field show that the nanotriangles exhibit higher coercivity
   as compared to that of the film deposited on plane substrate (in
   parallel direction). However, in perpendicular direction, lesser
   coercivity is observed in triangular film. In this case, the exchange
   bias measurements carried out after field cooling reveal a lesser
   exchange bias field for Co/Co triangles as compared to that of
   continuous film. These observations are attributed to the thermally
   unstable nature of triangles where thermal fluctuation flips the AFM
   moments resulting in lower exchange bias. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Aim To analyse the cytomorphological features of keratinocytes in smears
   obtained from the oral mucosa of tobacco users and from oral squamous
   cell carcinoma lesions.
   Methodology Oral smears were obtained from clinically, normal appearing
   mucosa of oral squamous cell carcinoma patients (n=20) and from the
   mucosa of smokers (n=20), and apparently healthy individuals (n=20) were
   used as controls. The smears were histochemically stained and
   cytomorphological assessment of the keratinocytes was carried out.
   One-way ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) was used for comparing the
   parameters among multiple groups and Tukey-HSD test was used to compare
   the mean values between groups.
   Results The mean nuclear area of keratinocytes from the mucosa of
   tobacco users was 46 +/- 2.57 and that of the oral squamous cell
   carcinoma lesion was 81.54 +/- 4.31. While there was a significant
   (P=0.001) reduction in the cellular area of keratinocytes from oral
   squamous cell carcinoma lesion when compared with those from oral smears
   of tobacco users.
   Conclusion Cytomorphometric analysis of keratinocytes can serve as a
   useful adjunct in the early diagnosis of oral squamous cell carcinomas.}},
