Owing these reasons various biologically sustainable methods of sludge reduction including the application of high oxygenation have been successfully tested. Experiments on actual sewage in two lab-scale sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) were conducted under normal (1.5â€“2.5 mgDO/L) and high dissolved oxygen (DO) (HDO: 3â€“6.5 mgDO/L) regimes. It was observed that microorganism allocated substrate between maintenance and growth in the form of maintenance coefficient. Which could be induced by endogenous respiration owing to high solids retention time (SRT), predation on bacteria, chemical toxicity, adverse environment, and viral attack on bacteria. The wastewater treatment process may experience one or more maintenance inducing factors; nevertheless, high SRT and prevailing environmental conditions are imminent and thus considered as primary maintenance (mp), while remaining are classified as secondary maintenance (ms). Average yield coefficient reduction at HDO was 32.7% and 28.2% compared to stoichiometric and at normal DO, respectively. The observed primary and secondary maintenance was 0.11gCOD/gVSS.d (Â±0.01) at an SRT of 25.2 d (Â±2.0) and 0.096 g 0.1 gCOD/gVSS.d (Â±0.045) at an SRT of 24.2 d (Â±3.6d), respectively. The results obtained under the study are not as precise as on pure culture and defined substrate, nevertheless, it gives an idea that how stress factors inducing maintenance need to be addressed more seriously and objectively while managing our efforts on sludge reduction.

Peristalsis is one of the most efficient of these mechanisms and offers considerable promise in microscale fluidics. Electrokinetic peristalsis has recently also stimulated significant attention. Electrical and magnetic fields also offer an excellent mode for regulating flows. Motivated by novel applications in electro-conductive microchannel transport systems, the current article investigates analytically the electromagnetic pumping of non-Newtonian aqueous electrolytes via peristaltic waves in a two-dimensional microchannel with different peristaltic waves propagating at the upper and lower channel wall (complex wavy scenario). The Stokes couple stress model is deployed to capture micro-structural characteristics of real working fluids. The unsteady two-dimensional conservation equations for mass and momentum conservation, electro-kinetic and magnetic body forces, are formulated in two dimensional Cartesian co-ordinates. The transport equations are transformed from the wave frame to the laboratory frame and the electrical field terms rendered into electrical potential terms via the Poisson-Boltzmann equation, Debye length approximation and ionic Nernst Planck equation. The dimensionless emerging linearized electro-magnetic boundary value problem is solved using integral methods. The influence of Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity (characteristic electro-osmotic velocity), couple stress length parameter (measure of the polarity of the fluid), Hartmann magnetic number, and electro-osmotic parameter on axial velocity, volumetric flow rate, time-averaged flow rate and streamline distribution are visualized and interpreted at length.

The most important factor in Aluminium production is the cost of energy used in the process of converting Aluminium oxide to Aluminium. This energy, which accounts for nearly 35% - 40% of the total cost of production of the metal, is primarily in the form of Direct Current (DC) power. DC Power is used in the process of electrolysis to convert Alumina (Aluminium Oxide) to Aluminium. With most of the production of electricity across the world is in the form of Alternating Current (AC) power, the process of conversion of this AC power to DC Power is critical. An efficient AC - DC converter becomes a critical component in the electrolytic reduction process of extracting non-ferrous metals in general and Aluminium in particular. The purpose of this research is to explore the reasons of mixed use of both the converter technologies, re-evaluate actual efficiency data on usage of both technologies and recommend the use of the more appropriate technology based on practical study.

The load distribution shift of the gear pair results in increased contact and bending stresses with the maximum stresses leaning towards the edge of the face width. These stress changes cause failures and gear performance variations, such as pitting, scuffing, crack initiation and eventually tooth breakage. In this paper, the contact and bending stresses of a misaligned spur gear pair were evaluated with and without friction by employing corresponding analytical methods and finite element method (FEM). Friction coefficient values of 0.1 to 0.3 were used to evaluate the effects of friction on contact and bending stress distribution of a spur gear pair with axial and angular misalignments. The stress concentration was found to be higher at the contact point and at the tooth root of the gear with the augmentation of the misalignment distance and angle. The maximum contact and bending stresses increased by 67.5% and 18.9%, respectively, when axial misalignments were subjected. Similarly, the maximum contact and bending stresses increased by 27.0% and 62.4%, respectively, for angular misalignments. Furthermore, the contact and bending stresses increased proportionally with the increasing coefficient of friction. Finally, the relationships between the normalized stress and misalignments (both axial and angular) were established.

For this, we propose to employ beating of dark hollow Gaussian laser beams (DHGBs) of different beam orders in plasma. In view of realistic situations, we also include the collisions between the electrons and the neutrals. Because of a special intensity gradient distribution in DHGBs, the emitted THz radiation is found to have a unique field profile with multiple focii. The dependence of plasma density, order of the beams and collision frequency on the THz field amplitude is discussed. The important feature to consider hollow Gaussian laser beams is having the same power at different beam orders. It is found that the amplitude of the emitted radiation is highly sensitive to the beam order of the incident lasers. An optimization of the plasma parameters and the lasers characteristics can lead to the enhancement in the THz intensity and the efficiency of the mechanism.

Though the problems of reâ€“scaling and rotation in region duplication, have been sufficiently investigated using keyâ€“point based methods, post-processing based attacks such as flip, blur, brightness and noise, remain an open challenge in this field. In this paper, we address the problem of copyâ€“move forgery detection in images, plus aim to identify copied regions, having undergone different geometric (such as rotation, reâ€“scale), and postâ€“processing attacks (such as Gaussian noise, blurring and brightness adjustment). In the proposed algorithm we introduce a region based keyâ€“point selection concept, which is considerably more discriminative than single SIFT keyâ€“point extraction. In this work, we apply Centroid Linkage Clustering, to identify duplicated regions in an image, from matched key-points. Also, we introduce a Graph Similarity Matching algorithm, to optimize false matches. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method in terms of forgery detection and localization efficiency, for a wide range of geometric and post-processing based attacks in region duplication.

An interpretive structural modelling (ISM) - MICMAC methodology is employed to identify the inter-relationships among the barriers of TPM implementation. A hierarchy model of these barriers is developed; by driving and dependence power of the barriers. MICMAC methodology determines driving and driven barriers based on their driving and dependence power.

One such technique, for opening of energy gap in graphene, is by way of doping the pristine graphene with boron or nitrogen. Besides many important applications, to which B- and N-doped graphene has been put, the one very important for solving the global energy crisis is by way of its capacity for hydrogen storage. In this paper electronic structure of B- and N-doped graphene has been studied by using Density Functional Theory, as implemented in WIEN2K code. PBE-GGA (Perdewâ€“Burkeâ€“Ernzerhof 96) pseudo-potential is used for solving the Schrodinger equation in self-consistent manner and to account for the exchange and correlation effects through the use of Generalized Gradient Approximation. The band structure calculations reveal that whereas a band gap opens at the symmetry point K both for B- and N-doped graphene, the center of the gap (i.e., the Dirac point in pristine graphene) is shifted above the Fermi level by about 2.20Â eV for B-doped graphene, and shifted down the Fermi level by about the same amount for N-doped graphene, when the doping level was kept 25% in each case. The energy gap opened was found to be about 0.30Â eV for B-doped graphene and 0.45Â eV for N-doped graphene. The linear dispersion characteristics obtained at Dirac point for pristine graphene, almost vanish for B-/N-doped graphene, due to symmetry breaking and opening of energy gap. The band structure and Density of States of B-/N-doped graphene are found also to depend on the choice of cell parameters.

Thus, it provides logically centralized visibility of the entire networking infrastructure to the controller. It enables the applications running on top of the control plane to innovate through network management and programmability. To envision the centralized control and visibility, the controller needs to discover the networking topology of the entire SDN infrastructure. However, discovering and maintaining a global view of the underlying network topology is a challenging task because of (i) frequently changing network topology caused by migration of the virtual machines in the data centers, mobile, end hosts and change in the number of data plane switches because of technical faults or network upgrade; (ii) lack of authentication mechanisms and scarcity in SDN standards; and (iii) availability of security solutions during topology discovery process. To this end, the aim of this paper is threefold. First, we investigate the working methodologies used to achieve global view by different SDN controllers, specifically, POX, Ryu, OpenDaylight, Floodlight, Beacon, ONOS, and HPEVAN. Second, we identify vulnerabilities that affect the topology discovery process in the above controller implementation. In particular, we provide a detailed analysis of the threats namely link layer discovery protocol (LLDP) poisoning, LLDP flooding, and LLDP replay attack concerning these controllers. Finally, to countermeasure the identified risks, we propose a novel mechanism called TILAK which generates random MAC destination addresses for LLDP packets and use this randomness to create a flow entry for the LLDP packets. It is a periodic process to prevent LLDP packet-based attacks that are caused only because of lack of verification of source authentication and integrity of LLDP packets. The implementation results for TILAK confirm that it covers targeted threats with lower resource penalty.

The concept here is that the readings will be similar, especially at notable data points like turns or acceleration/decelerations.

The Chun\'s scheme provides user anonymity and eviction of unauthorized users. In our research work we have crypt analyze the Chun\'s method and shown that it is vulnerable to various types of attacks: insider attack, off line password verifier attack, stolen verifier attack and impersonating attack. To overcome the security vulnerability of Chun\'s scheme, we have proposed an advance scheme of password authentication and user anonymity using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and stegnography.

In general, rather than simply supported beam and diaphragm, microcantilever beams are widely preferred in BIO-MEMS and RF-MEMS for biosensing and RF switching, respectively. The lower level detection ability and simple structure make these cantilevers more applicable in many applications. The rectangular cantilever beams are most widely used in TG detection. but due to their constant or planner geometry and non-adhesion of analyte they are less sensitive in case of nano or pico level biosensing. This paper introduces the fractal surface geometry concept for increasing the deflection sensitivity corresponding to lower molecular or analyte loading. The rectangular and stepped cantilever beam structures along with fractal surface are simulated and analysed for TG molecular pressure 294.3 Pa. Both the rectangular and stepped microcantilever beams with fractal surface exhibit better free end or tip deflection (nearly 2Ã—) as compare to the planner surface based beam.

The present concrete matrix gives only 10 to 12 percent of flexural strength as compared to its compressive strength. Human hair lasts for decades before finally decomposing and entering to Carbon and Nitrogen cycle. The waste human hair dumped in the streams chokes the streams and increases the environmental burden. In this experimental work, feasibility for enhancing the flexural strength of concrete with two-dimensional variation in human hair i.e., the length of hair fiber and its proportion in the concrete matrix, has been investigated. The concrete specimens tested at the age of 7 and 28 days, reveled an increase in the flexural strength as compared to the control mix.

Electrokinetic transport with peristaltic phenomena grabbed a significant attention due to its novel applications in engineering. Electrical fields also provide an excellent mode for regulating flows. The electrohydrodynamics problem is modified by means of Debyeâ€“HÃ¼ckel linearization. Firstly, the governing flow problem is described by continuity and momentum equations in the presence of electrokinetic forces in Cartesian coordinates, then long wavelength and low/zero Reynolds (â€œneglecting the inertial forcesâ€) approximations are applied to modify the governing flow problem. The resulting differential equations are solved analytically in order to obtain exact solutions for velocity profile whereas the numerical integration is carried out to analyze the pumping characteristics. The physical behaviour of sundry parameters is discussed for velocity profile, pressure rise and volume flow rate. In particular, the behaviour of electro-osmotic parameter, phase difference, and Helmholtzâ€“Smoluchowski velocity is examined and discussed. The trapping mechanism is also visualized by drawing streamlines against the governing parameters. The present study offers various interesting results that warrant further study on electrokinetic transport with peristalsis.

In silico models assumed normal strain or strain energy density (SED) as the stimulus to predict loading-induced osteogenesis, however, these models may have limited success in fitting the in vivo new bone formation at several instances. For example, rest-inserted cyclic loading amplifies the new bone formation as compared to continuous-cyclic loading even though similar strain magnitude were induced in both the cases. It is also believed that loading-induced interstitial fluid flow can also be a potential stimulus of osteogenesis. The present study hypothesizes that fluid motion as osteogenic stimulus may explain the afore-mentioned anomalies. Accordingly, this work studies osteogenesis as functions of SED and canalicular fluid motion using an in silico model. Therefore, the new bone formation is considered roughly proportional to stimuli above their osteogenic thresholds. This model attempts to simulate in vivo new bone formation noticed in rest-inserted cantilever loading studies. The model\'s prediction of site-specific new bone formation improves when fluid flow is considered as the stimulus. It is also noticed that fluid motion as the stimulus closely fits the new bone formation for another in vivo study where the effects of aging on osteogenesis were examined. These attempts to establish fluid flow as a potential osteogenic stimulus can be useful in the prediction of site-specific new bone formation. The findings will ultimately be useful in designing biomechanical interventions such as prophylactic exercises to cure bone loss.

An in-depth study was carried out to biosynthesize, characterize and assess any possible mutagenic potential and ecotoxicity of the microbial polysaccharide biopolymer. Microstructural investigations using confocal microscopy, Fourier transform (FT)-Raman depth profile mapping and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the biosynthetically modified polysaccharide revealed internal structural perturbations, as well as occlusion of granular pores by extraneous materials. The Raman 3D mapping depth profile along with time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry also indicated important structural and surface modifications, which could be correlated to the production of microbial exopolysaccharides and secondary metabolites. The study then looked into any possible genetic mutation and ecological risks associated with the biosynthetically modified polysaccharide through the investigation of genotoxicity and ecotoxicity. The genotoxicity study was carried out through bacterial reverse gene mutation (Ames) test by using two different strains (TA98 and TA100) of bacteria.

Aadhar has not only helped in better identification of Indians but it has also lead them to reap enormous benefits of various government grants as well as subsidies, including the LPG subsidies as well as the scholarships intended for the meritorious students. This number carries various positive implications with itself. At the same time it also suffers from certain shortcomings of the likes of security concerns. This paper aims to assess and analyse the financial aspect of Aadhar/UID. The area under purview here is that of seeding the Aadhar with bank accounts of individuals in India. An assessment has been undertaken of the extent to which individuals feel to be benefitted out of this linkage. The results depict that the people consider this linkage as an effective tool for better identification of an individual.

Changes in surge distances are facilitated by predefining number of steps and different wheel speeds which varies from 0.5v to 2.5v where v is 0.3605 m/s in real scenario. Robot with a predefined wheel speed takes minimum one step and maximum up to six steps after which the environmental conditions change. For a single step and a predefined wheel speed, 100 simulations were performed. There are five different wheel speeds to be tested for a step size hence 500 simulations are recorded. So with different combinations of step size varying from one to six with five different wheel speeds produces 3000 simulations.

A nice correlation has been found between optical properties of the aforesaid nano-clusters with our evaluated theoretical descriptors. The similar agreement between experimental bond length and computed data is also reflected in this analysis.

Closed-form solutions are derived for the non-dimensional boundary value problem. The computations demonstrate that magnitude of electric potential function is increased with a decrease in the thickness of the electrical double layer (EDL). Stronger electric field also decelerates the flow and decreases local wall shear stress. Hydrodynamic pressure is increased with EDL thickness whereas it is suppressed with electric field.

Additionally the study focusses on examining the effect of consumer\'s online purchase attitude on their purchase intention. Design/Methodology/Approach: An empirical study was conducted where 100 individuals responded towards the questionnaire. The study examines that how an individual\'s perception differs from each other on the different factors affecting their purchase attitude which will determine their online purchase intention. Findings:The proposed framework explains the 64% of the total variance in purchase attitude affected by some identified factors in online shopping. Out of these major identified factors six factors were proven to have a significant effect on the purchase attitude i.e. risk of identity theft, risk of losing privacy, trustworthiness of the vendor, past purchase experience and time taken to deliver the products whereas the remaining three factors were proven to have no significant effect on the purchase attitude i.e. product return policy, time taken to access web page and information on FAQ\'s and complaint resolution.Additionally As a result the literature support the positive relationship betweenattitude and online purchase intention. Research Limitations/Implications:The study was limited to the population of two cities of Rajasthan i.e. Ajmer and Jaipur taking small sample into consideration. Additionally the study could cover only 64% of variability in the online purchase intention due to the discussed factors. Practical Implications:The study contributes towards the development of the various ecommerce models and helps the various e-commerce companies as well as the online vendors to understand the different factors affecting online purchase intention due to differences in attitude which will increase their revenue and improve upon their strategies. Social implications: The study will benefit the society by providing the various critical factors affecting an individual\'s online purchase intention to be considered while shopping online and would create more awareness among them about purchasing over the internet.

Amplified stressing is harmful to tree but the concept on contrary is useful in current context and envisages amplified generation of electricity to actuate nanoswimmer. It has been observed through simulation results that amplification of stresses to the tune of 68.95% is achievable by simple primary branching.

The cilia are arranged at equal intervals and protrude normally from both walls of the infinitely long channel. A metachronal wave is generated due to natural beating of cilia and the direction of wave propagation is parallel to the direction of fluid flow. Appropriate expressions are presented for deformation via longitudinal and transverse velocity components induced by the ciliary beating phenomenon with cilia assumed to follow elliptic trajectories. The conservation equations for mass, longitudinal and transverse (linear) momentum and angular momentum are reduced in accordance with the long wavelength and creeping Stokesian flow approximations and then normalized with appropriate transformations. The resulting non-linear moving boundary value problem is solved analytically for constant micro-inertia density, subject to physically realistic boundary conditions. Closed-form expressions are derived for axial velocity, angular velocity, volumetric flow rate and pressure rise. The transport phenomena are shown to be dictated by several non-Newtonian parameters, including micropolar material parameter and Eringen coupling parameter, and also several geometric parameters, viz eccentricity parameter, wave number and cilia length. The influence of these parameters on streamline profiles (with a view to addressing trapping features via bolus formation and evolution), pressure gradient and other characteristics are evaluated graphically. Both axial and angular velocities are observed to be substantially modified with both micropolar rheological parameters and furthermore are significantly altered with increasing volumetric flow rate. Free pumping is also examined. An inverse relationship between pressure rise and flow rate is computed which is similar to that observed in Newtonian fluids. The study is relevant to hemodynamics in narrow capillaries and also bio-inspired micro-fluidic devices.

This paper proposes a methodology for using chaotic current mode-controlled DC (Direct Current)-DC (Direct Current) boost converter in spread spectrum communication. A noncoherent receiver is developed. For this, an Adaline-based adaptive filter is designed to recover the message from spread spectrum signal at the receiver end. The proposed Adaline-based receiver is tested by transmitting various types of message signals while considering white noise at different signal-to-noise ratio. For designing noncoherent receiver-based chaotic communication, use of power electronics converters is expected to play a vital role in the future.

Among the various processes of manufacturing prevalent for discontinuous nano hybrid metal matrix composites, particularly stir casting is accepted as a favorable method, which is also commercially viable. Stir casting is advantageous for mass production of composites for being simple and flexible in nature along with cost effectiveness.

Methods: The governing equations are reduced in linear form using dimensional analysis and considering the low Reynolds number and large wavelength approximations. The time dependent temperature field, axial velocity, transverse velocity and pressure difference are obtained analytically in closed form solution. Trapping phenomenon is also discussed with the help of contour plots of stream function. A comparative study of pure water (Newtonian fluid), Copper water nanofluids and Silver water nanofluids under the influence of relevant physical parameters is made in graphical form and also discussed. The effects of absorption parameter and Grashof number on velocity profiles, temperature profiles and pressure distribution along the length of channel are examined. Results conclusions: The computational results reveal that the velocity profile is maximum for Silver water nanofluids however, it is least for Copper water nanofluids. It is also concluded the temperature profile is more for pure water in comparison to Silver water and Copper water nanofluids. This model is applicable to design, micro-peristaltic pumps which help in Nanoparticle-based targeted drug delivery and to transport the sensitive or corrosive fluids, sanitary fluids, slurries and noxious fluids in nuclear industry.

On-board powering is the major concern for locomotion of nanoswimmer and is being considered to be addressed by energy transduction mechanism to harness energy from surrounding using energy of stochastic vibrations by electrostatic, electromagnetic, and piezoelectric means. Among all, piezoelectric is emerging as a promising conversion transduction mechanism of energy harnessing for artificial nanoswimmer. In this context, in present work, an elastic flagellum of a nanoswimmer is modeled as a cantilever beam and a simulation study is done in COMSOL. The novel design of branched flagellum is conceived, modeled, and simulated. COMSOL simulation studies have been performed to compare the effect of primary and secondary branching in flagellum design in terms of stress and electric potential. Enhancement in stress and electric potential is observed approximately 20 and 15% on increasing secondary branching uniformly on the main structure of cantilever beam towards free end and keeping primary branches constant. An enhanced stress allows for larger efficiency of conversion mechanism and, therefore, it is concluded that branching of flagellum can be pivotal in increasing on-board harnessing of energy for propulsion of nanorobots.

Polymers of karaya gum are ideal choice over synthetic ones because of its natural availability, cost effectiveness, non-hazardous nature, easy recovery, and physicochemical properties. Moreover, the tree is widely used in tribal populations for its indigenous remedies against various ailments like oligospermia, leucorrhoea, constipation, body swelling, throat infection, wound healing, etc. Biochemical analysis authenticates photophysical, photochemical as well as pharmacological uses, and validates ethnobotanical applications by tribal communities up to some extent. The main purpose of this review is to highlight the potential of Sterculia urens, based on its ethnobotanical uses, industrial potential and perspectives of conservation and sustainable management. A comprehensive survey of literature was done to further explore various growth constraints, conservation strategies, and wide industrial applications. Sterculia urens has embraced significant values in international trade market due to its exceptional properties. Also the presence of diverse bioactive compounds has made this plant of interest for scientific research. Owing to the wide range of commercial applications and lack of knowledge regarding the scientific gum tapping methods, the plant has been exploited extensively for its highly valued products, while the propagation in natural habitat has been declining over the past few years. Excessive consumption of karaya gum has resulted in critically low abundance and thus this plant is now considered as endangered plant species in some states of India. Keeping in view its endangered status, conservation, and mass scale production through biotechnological approaches are fruitful towards maintaining its biological abundance.

In this study, a latent heat thermal energy storage system (LHTESS) for stationary C.I. engine exhaust heat was developed and integrated with engine. A shell and tube type heat exchanger having 346 mm diameter and 420 mm height with 45 numbers of tubes with 18 mm diameter was developed to store thermal energy, in which Erythritol (C4H10O4) was used as a phase change material. The engine performance and the thermal energy storage system performance parameters such as amount of heat stored, and charging efficiency were evaluated. Slight decrease in the engine performance was observed when latent heat thermal energy storage system was integrated to engine but amount of energy which could be recovered was significant. At a load of 4.4 kW the maximum charging efficiency, recovery efficiency and percentage energy saved was 69.53%, 38% and 11.33% respectively.

The normalized governing equations are reduced with lubrication approximations (long wavelength and low Reynolds number assumptions). Poisson-Boltzmann equation is also simplified by using Debye-HÃ¼ckel linearization. No slip conditions are imposed at the channel walls. The analytical solutions are obtained for temperature field and nanoparticle volume fraction. However, a perturbation method is used to find out an approximate solution for axial velocity, pressure rise and volumetric flow rate. The perturbation solutions are further graphically illustrated with MATLAB software. The perturbation solution is also validated with numerical results simulated by MATLAB coding through BVP command. The effects of thermal radiation and non-Newtonian parameters on flow characteristics, pumping characteristics, wall shear stress and trapping phenomenon are discussed. A comparative study is also made to study the electroosmotic flow through uniform and nonuniform asymmetric microfluidic channel.

It falls under the class of NPhard problem and becomes non-solvable for large data set by traditional methods like integer linear programming and branch and bound method, being the earlier popular approaches. Genetic Algorithm based solutions emerged as the most popular tool to solve this which is a heuristic mechanism to find the closest approximate solution to the problem. In this paper, we approach Travelling Salesman Problem using GA approach, a natural selection technique which repeatedly modifies a population of individual solutions, with the added power of modern computing systems. Here we come up with a parallel version of GA for both multicore and many core architectures over OpenMP and CUDA in order to make some of the challenging problems like Vehicle Routing Problem for google maps, DNA sequencing and many more optimization problems involving a good amount of complex computation and data handling. The paper presents a comparative analysis of the results for both CUDA and OpenMP for various degree and structure of graphs depicting close approximation to the accuracy in terms of most optimal path for traversal with highly reduced execution time.

Different concrete mixes, prepared for three water-cement ratios and 5 jarosite replacement levels. One fourth of cement has been replaced by fly ash in all the concrete mixtures. When compared to the control mixes, encouraging results were obtained in the tests to determine the mechanical properties of the concrete containing jarosite. The other important aspect of concrete i.e. durability has been revealed as satisfactory. The leaching of jarosite in concrete mixtures has been observed within the permissible limits of United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). The addition of jarosite as a partial sand replacement in concrete (along with fly ash as mineral admixture) up to 25% could be a new alternative feasible solution to its disposal issue. Also, the concrete with 15% jarosite as a sand replacement could be best suited for road and building construction purpose.

Recent advancements in nanotechnology-based medicines have opened new horizons for combating multidrug resistance in microorganisms. In particular, the use of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) as a potent antibacterial agent has received much attention. The most critical physico-chemical parameters that affect the antimicrobial potential of AgNPs include size, shape, surface charge, concentration and colloidal state. AgNPs exhibits their antimicrobial potential through multifaceted mechanisms. AgNPs adhesion to microbial cells, penetration inside the cells, ROS and free radical generation, and modulation of microbial signal transduction pathways have been recognized as the most prominent modes of antimicrobial action. On the other side, AgNPs exposure to human cells induces cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, and inflammatory response in human cells in a cell-type dependent manner. This has raised concerns regarding use of AgNPs in therapeutics and drug delivery. We have summarized the emerging endeavors that address current challenges in relation to safe use of AgNPs in therapeutics and drug delivery platforms. Based on research done so far, we believe that AgNPs can be engineered so as to increase their efficacy, stability, specificity, biosafety and biocompatibility. In this regard, three perspectives research directions have been suggested that include (1) synthesizing AgNPs with controlled physico-chemical properties, (2) examining microbial development of resistance toward AgNPs, and (3) ascertaining the susceptibility of cytoxicity, genotoxicity, and inflammatory response to human cells upon AgNPs exposure.

This decoupling provides several advantages such as flexibility, programmability, and centralized control. However, SDN also introduces new vulnerabilities due to the required communication between data plane and control plane. Examples of threats that leverage such vulnerabilities are the control plane saturation and switch buffer overflow attacks. These attacks can be launched by flooding the TCP SYN packets from data plane (i.e., switches) to the control plane. This paper presents SAFETY, a novel solution for the early detection and mitigation of TCP SYN flooding. SAFETY harnesses the programming and wide visibility approach of SDN with entropy method to determine the randomness of the flow data. The entropy information includes destination IP and few attributes of TCP flags. To show the feasibility and effectiveness of SAFETY, we implement it as an extension module in Floodlight controller and evaluate it under different conditional scenarios. We run a thorough evaluation of our implementation through extensive emulation via Mininet. The experimental results show that when compared to the state-of-the-art, SAFETY brings a significant improvement (13%) regarding processing delay experienced by a legitimate node. Other parameters such as CPU utilization at the controller and attack detection time are also examined and shows improvement in various scenarios.

It is also known as brittle bone disease. Surgical procedure is one of the ways adopted by clinicians for the management of OI. In recent years, it has however become clear that physical activity is equally important for managing OI in both children and adults. Exogenous mechanical stimulation e.g. prophylactic exercises may be useful in improving the bone mass and strength of OI bones as loading-induced mechanical components e.g. normal strain and canalicular fluid flow stimulate remodeling activities. Several studies have characterized the strain environment in OI bones, whereas, very few studies attempted to characterize the canalicular fluid flow. In the present study, we anticipate that canalicular fluid flow reduces in OI bone as compared to healthy bone under physiological loading. This work accordingly computes the canalicular fluid distribution in the single osteon model of OI and control/normal bones subjected to normal physiological loadings. A transversely isotropic poroelastic model of osteon is developed. Loading is applied in accordance with gait cycles reported for OI and healthy bones. Fluid distribution patterns computed for OI and healthy bones are compared at different time-points of stance phase of the gait cycle. A significant reduction in fluid flow is observed in case of OI bone as compared to healthy bone. This clearly indicates that improvements in physical activities or exercises can be designed to enhance the level of canalicular fluid flow to initiate possible osteogenic activities and the bone.

We have taken a small step in this direction by treating the query as a question and classifying it with the best suited classification algorithm. In this paper, we have tried to find out that when a perfect-informer of the question (knowing what is asked) is provided as an input for classification algorithms like SVN, NaÃ¯ve Base, and decision tree, we want to observe their accuracy on the same data set of questions.

A detailed study of the stages of development of the antenna has been made, illustrating the effect that various design elements have on the operating characteristics of the final design. There is specific emphasis on the use of slots in the ground plane. Variations in return loss, gain, VSWR, operating frequency and bandwidth with changes in the design of the ground plane have been documented. The antenna is designed to perform in the X-band, more specifically around 9 GHz, making it well suited for short range search.

Fluid viscosity is considered as a function of both depth and temperature. The Runge-Kutta fourth-order method along with the shooting technique is employed for solving a set of coupled ordinary differential equations. The computed results reveal that heat transfer is appreciably enhanced with more porosity and rotation of the fluid.

The wall surface is propagating with sinusoidal wave velocity c. The flow characteristics are governed by the mass, momentum and energy conservation principle. Low Reynolds number and large wavelength approximations are taken into consideration to simplify the non-linear terms. Analytical solutions for axial velocity, temperature field, pressure gradient and stream function are obtained under certain physical boundary conditions. Two types of nanoparticles, SiO2 and Ag, are considered for analysis with water as base fluid. This is the first article in the literature that discusses the SiO2 and Ag nanoparticles for a peristaltic flow with variable viscosity. The effects of physical parameters on velocity, temperature, pressure and trapping are discussed. A comparative study of SiO2 nanofluid, Ag nanofluid and pure water is also presented.

People who are not intended to be the recipients of the message should not even suspect that a hidden message exists. Text steganography is challenging as it is difficult to hide data in text without affecting the semantics. Retention of the semantics in the generated stego-text is crucial to minimize suspicion.This paper proposes a technique for text steganography using classical language Sanskrit. As Sanskrit is morphologically rich with a very large vocabulary, it is possible to modify the cover text without affecting the semantics. In addition numerical encoding is used to map a Sanskrit character to a numerical value. This helps in hiding the message effectively. Moreover, in this technique, a key is used for additional security. The key is generated dynamically and is appended to the final message to further add security to the proposed method. The proposed method generated stego-texts with syntactic correctness of 96.7%, semantic correctness of 86.6%, and with a suspicion factor of just 23.4% upon evaluation.

Methods The governing equations are reduced in linear form using dimensional analysis and considering the low Reynolds number and large wavelength approximations. The time dependent temperature field, axial velocity, transverse velocity and pressure difference are obtained analytically in closed form solution. Trapping phenomenon is also discussed with the help of contour plots of stream function. A comparative study of pure water (Newtonian fluid), Copper water nanofluids and Silver water nanofluids under the influence of relevant physical parameters is made in graphical form and also discussed. The effects of absorption parameter and Grashof number on velocity profiles, temperature profiles and pressure distribution along the length of channel are examined. Results conclusions The computational results reveal that the velocity profile is maximum for Silver water nanofluids however, it is least for Copper water nanofluids. It is also concluded the temperature profile is more for pure water in comparison to Silver water and Copper water nanofluids. This model is applicable to design, micro-peristaltic pumps which help in Nanoparticle-based targeted drug delivery and to transport the sensitive or corrosive fluids, sanitary fluids, slurries and noxious fluids in nuclear industry.

Major cities of India were industrialized and required more work force in metropolitan cities, leading to uncoordinated and unplanned growth, often termed as urban sprawl. Urban sprawl destroyed the natural resources such as open green space, agricultural land, open water bodies and ground water. In this paper, an attempt has been made to monitor urban sprawl using Shannon\'s Entropy model, Remote Sensing, and GIS for city Jaipur, India. The changed entropy value during the years 1972-2013 proves more dispersed growth in the city. The built-up area of Jaipur has increased from 40 km2 in 1972 to 400 km2 in 2013. Land use percentage of urban settlement is doubled as compared to the urban population of Jaipur during 1972-2013.

A full quadratic model has been adopted for modelling. It has been found that axial depth of cut is the most dominant cutting parameter for the tangential and axial cutting forces, accounting for 49.38 and 47.12% contributions, respectively. Radial depth of cut is the most dominant parameter for radial force and contributes 69.94% for it. Results also revealed that force components decrease with increase in cutting speed. There is very small variation in cutting force components in the cutting speed range of 75â€“150Â m/min at lower values of axial and radial depth of cut. Surface roughness is effected by cutting speed largely followed by feed.

At T=0, the quenching effect of deformation is predominant. DF is found usually less in oblate deformation than in prolate. DF decreases with increasing prolate deformation even though the 2s-orbit is empty which shows the role of deformation in central depletion apart from the unoccupancy in s-orbit as is usually believed. As T increases, the occupancy of s-orbit increases, shell structure melts, the deformation vanishes and the weakening of central depletion is solely due to the temperature. The bubble effect is eliminated at Tâ‰ˆ3â€“5 MeV as indicated by DF and the charge form factor. The temperature effect is found less prominent in superheavy bubble nuclei where the role of shell effects is indicated.

The load distribution shift of the gear pair results in increased contact and bending stresses with the maximum stresses leaning towards the edge of the face width. These stress changes cause failures and gear performance variations, such as pitting, scuffing, crack initiation and eventually tooth breakage. In this paper, the contact and bending stresses of a misaligned spur gear pair were evaluated with and without friction by employing corresponding analytical methods and finite element method (FEM). Friction coefficient values of 0.1 to 0.3 were used to evaluate the effects of friction on contact and bending stress distribution of a spur gear pair with axial and angular misalignments. The stress concentration was found to be higher at the contact point and at the tooth root of the gear with the augmentation of the misalignment distance and angle.

Similarly, the maximum contact and bending stresses increased by 27.0\\% and 62.4\\%, respectively, for angular misalignments.

The desired magnetic nanocaps composed of CoO/Co bilayer film on these patterned substrates were prepared by molecular beam epitaxy technique under ultra-high vacuum conditions. For this, a Co layer of ~10 nm thickness was deposited on the substrates and then oxidized in-situ to form CoO/Co/PS in-situ oxidized film or ex-situ in ambiance which also gives CoO/Co/PS naturally oxidized film. Simultaneously, reference thin films of Co (~10 nm) were also prepared on plane Si substrate and similar oxidation treatments were performed on them respectively. The magnetic properties studied using SQUID technique revealed higher exchange bias (~1736 Oe) in the in-situ oxidized Co/PS film as compared to that in naturally oxidized Co/PS film (~1544 Oe) and also compared to the reference film. The observed variations in the magnetic properties are explained in terms of surface patterning induced structural changes of the deposited films and different oxidation methods.

In the first phase, a software reliability growth model has been proposed with compounded decreased error rate to predict the software reliability. The model is further extended by incorporating Cobb-Douglas production function to model the combined effect of time and resources used. Multi-layer feed-forward neural network is used to solve the problems. The weights associated with various input parameters are updated using generalised delta rule and Levenberg-Marquardt method. A comparison is then made with the results from existing models in the literature. The work is validated by using two famous real data sets.

The purpose of this paper is to contribute to this debate by exploring the LIBs in SMEs through three case studies. Design/methodology/approach A case study approach was employed followed by interpretive structural modelling (ISM) to model the interrelationship among the LIBs. Findings This study reveals that lack of management commitment, leadership and resources are the key barriers to lean implementation in SMEs in India. Furthermore, poor communication between different levels of the organisation and inadequate dissemination of the knowledge of lean benefits also creates hindrance in lean implementation.

Additionally, due to the presence of artifacts and variation in skin texture and smooth lesion boundaries, the accuracy of such methods gets hampered. The objective of this research is to develop an automated hair detection and lesion segmentation algorithm using lesion-specific properties to improve the accuracy. The aforementioned objective is achieved in two ways. Firstly, a novel hair detection algorithm is designed by considering the properties of dermoscopic hair. Second, a novel chroma-based geometric deformable model is used to effectively differentiate the lesion from the surrounding skin. The speed function incorporates the chrominance properties of the lesion to stop evolution at the lesion boundary. Automatic initialization of the initial contour and chrominance-based speed function aids in providing robust and flexible segmentation. The proposed approach is tested on 200 images from PH2 and 900 images from ISBI 2016 datasets. Average accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and overlap scores of 93.4, 87.6, 95.3, and 11.52% respectively are obtained for the PH2 dataset. Similarly, the proposed method resulted in average accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and overlap scores of 94.6, 82.4, 97.2, and 7.20% respectively for the ISBI 2016 dataset.

The source is capable to produce eight spectral lines for pure helium in the VUV range from 20 to 60 nm and total 24 spectral lines covering the wavelength range 20â€“106 nm for the admixture of gases.

In the current study, a novel nanoparticle assisted polymer flooding approach was carried out to overcome these limitations. To determine whether nanoparticles influence the displacement efficiency of the injected fluid, we used a blend of xanthan gum and nickel nanoparticles. We have evaluated the changes in the dilute solution viscosity of xanthan when the nickel nanoparticles are added and have found out that a xanthan-nickel nanoparticles mixture has a higher intrinsic viscosity of 55.25 dL/g compared to 49.13 dL/g for the gum solution. Efficiency of nanoparticle assisted polymer flooding was evaluated in sand packed bioreactors with âˆ¼0.6 PV of residual oil in place (ROIP). Flooding results demonstrated the highest recovery of 5.98% of additional ROIP with xanthan-nickel nanoparticle mixture compared to 4.48 and 4.58% of ROIP during the separate flooding of xanthan and nanoparticles, respectively.

Sensors generate sensitive data in many applications and thus methods to secure the data so as to prevent easy access by unauthorized agents are essential. Security against false data injection or data tampering can be provided through encryption of sensor data; but it increases load on processing. Securing data, however, puts a burden on the node battery. Data aggregation aims both at data reduction so as to spend less time for encryption as well as reduce transmission load, but demanding additional processing at aggregating node. Thus, aggregation and security are contradictory solutions. The dilemma can be resolved by allowing targeted malleability of encrypted data through homomorphic encryption. The recent research works recommend schemes which use homomorphic MACs, signatures and a blend of private and public cryptography to achieve the purpose. This paper proposes a generalized framework which will be more secure in aspects of secure data aggregation and security of data which include the data privacy and detection of tampering data through homomorphic primitive.

In silico models assumed normal strain or strain energy density (SED) as the stimulus to predict loading-induced osteogenesis, however, these models may have limited success in fitting the in vivo new bone formation at several instances. For example, rest-inserted cyclic loading amplifies the new bone formation as compared to continuous-cyclic loading even though similar strain magnitude were induced in both the cases. It is also believed that loading-induced interstitial fluid flow can also be a potential stimulus of osteogenesis. The present study hypothesizes that fluid motion as osteogenic stimulus may explain the afore-mentioned anomalies. Accordingly, this work studies osteogenesis as functions of SED and canalicular fluid motion using an in silico model. Therefore, the new bone formation is considered roughly proportional to stimuli above their osteogenic thresholds. This model attempts to simulate in vivo new bone formation noticed in rest-inserted cantilever loading studies. The model\'s prediction of site-specific new bone formation improves when fluid flow is considered as the stimulus. It is also noticed that fluid motion as the stimulus closely fits the new bone formation for another in vivo study where the effects of aging on osteogenesis were examined. These attempts to establish fluid flow as a potential osteogenic stimulus can be useful in the prediction of site-specific new bone formation. The findings will ultimately be useful in designing biomechanical interventions such as prophylactic exercises to cure bone loss. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

With increasing Hartmann number, the formation of bolus in the regime (associated with trapping) is inhibited up to a critical value of magnetic field. Flow rate, axial velocity and local wall shear stress are strongly decreased with greater Hartmann number whereas pressure difference is enhanced with higher Hartmann number at low time values but reduced with greater elapse in time. With greater electro-osmotic parameter (i.e. smaller Debye length), maximum time-averaged flow rate is enhanced, whereas the axial velocity is reduced. An increase in electrical field parameter (i.e. maximum electro-osmotic velocity) causes an increase in maximum time-averaged flow rate.

In this article, the nonlinear optical response of pseudorelativistic electrons in phosphorene under intense applied electromagnetic field is investigated. Using Floquet theory, we demonstrate the anisotropic behaviour of anomalous Rabi oscillations in phosphorene, which occurs far from the conventional resonance. The role of anisotropy on anomalous Rabi oscillations in phosphorene is also justified numerically. The Bloch-Siegert shift is observed under strong driving field that strongly depends on the anisotropy of the energy bands of phosphorene. A theoretical description of the pump-probe experiment is given to detect the anomalous Rabi oscillations in phosphorene. The differential transmission coefficient shows a sinusoidal behaviour as a function of pump pulse duration whose amplitude exhibits a power law decay, which is quite different from graphene (relativistic fermionic system). So the Floquet theory can be used to characterize the different fermionic systems.

In peroxide-shunt assays, this variant exhibits an increased rate of turnover for thioanisole and benzaldehyde oxidation as compared to the wild-type (WT) Mb. Indeed, in the presence of excess hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a 9-fold and 81-fold increase in activity was observed over multiple turnovers for thioanisole sulfoxidation and benzoic acid formation, respectively. The increased oxidation activity in the H64NH2Tyr Mb mutant underlined the role of NH2Tyr in the distal active-site scaffold in peroxide activation.

Additionally, due to the presence of artifacts and variation in skin texture and smooth lesion boundaries, the accuracy of such methods gets hampered. The objective of this research is to develop an automated hair detection and lesion segmentation algorithm using lesion-specific properties to improve the accuracy. The aforementioned objective is achieved in two ways. Firstly, a novel hair detection algorithm is designed by considering the properties of dermoscopic hair. Second, a novel chroma-based geometric deformable model is used to effectively differentiate the lesion from the surrounding skin. The speed function incorporates the chrominance properties of the lesion to stop evolution at the lesion boundary. Automatic initialization of the initial contour and chrominance-based speed function aids in providing robust and flexible segmentation.

The education system has sensed the need to churn out young entrepreneurs in order to drive the economy forward at a significant pace, and today entrepreneurship development is headway with a host of technical subjects. However, it is imperative to recognise that the entrepreneur is first and foremost, a brand on his/her own accord, even before he/she projects his/her company. One\'s image is crucial in the advancement of his/her venture and life at large. In today\'s competitive world, one has to stand out amidst the multitudes, personally as well as professionally. Technical know-how is not always enough as a professional. One needs the winning edge! Image Management concretely leverages one\'s position on the ladder of growth, success and recognition as well as aspirations in the vitality of the contemporary world. Thus emerges a weighty need for the incorporation of the study of Image Management in the education system for every budding entrepreneur. Ironically, the education system has yet to recognise and explore this area. The paper recognises this need and attempts to conceptually bridge the gap by bringing forth the relevance, purpose and utility of Image Management. Â© Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.

Since, a molecule is the smallest component whose electrical properties can be engineered, it can be argued that the ultimate integrated circuit will be constructed at the molecular level. This fact has been the driving force behind molecular electronics research of recent times. This article investigates the aspects of modeling, synthesis and analysis of nanocell based molecular memory. In our work, we have developed the HSPICE as well as probabilistic models for nanocell based molecular memory.

A gear pair in action is generally subjected to contact loading at the mating surface. In this paper, the stresses due to contact loading have been evaluated on the surface of gear tooth and along the gear tooth depth. The spur gear was considered for this study for two different loading conditions, torques of 150 Nm and 200 Nm. The involute profile of the spur gear was generated using an ANSYS APDL program prior to spur gear model development. The finite element analysis was carried out using ANSYS 15. The Finite Element Method (FEM) was comparatively an easy and accurate technique for analysing the nonlinear gear contact stresses. Frictional coefficients ranging from 0.0 until 0.3 were selected and the corresponding contact stresses were found to be directly proportional to the friction coefficients. A governing equation for the relationship between the dimensionless contact stress values and gear tooth depth ratios for varying friction coefficients was established. The results showed that the maximum stress was located beneath the surface of the gear tooth in contact for low friction coefficient values, Î¼ < 0.23. The stress trend remains the same for Î¼ > 0.23 but the surface stress becomes greater than the stresses beneath the surface. Furthermore, the position of maximum stress along the depth of contact was unchanged regardless of the amount of torque applied and frictional coefficient values.

The similar shape character has a very minute difference, which is called critical region and used to discriminate them by human beings. The primary goal of the current work is to identify the critical region of the similar character and use the same to generate additional features in order to minimize the classification errors in the end results. It is also quite challenging to identify the critical region as the characters are written in different handwriting styles and fonts.

Creeping flow is taken into account (inertial forces are small compared with viscous forces) i.e., Reynolds number is low (Re <1) and wavelength is also taken to be very large. The Buongiorno formulation for nanofluids is employed with an Oberbeck-Boussinesq approximation. Closed-form solutions are developed for the non-dimensional governing equations subject to physically realistic boundary conditions.

The Jefferys\' non-Newtonian constitutive model is employed to characterize rheological properties of the fluid. The unsteady conservation equations for mass and momentum with electro-kinetic and Darcian porous medium drag force terms are reduced to a system of steady linearized conservation equations in an axisymmetric coordinate system. The long wavelength, creeping (low Reynolds number) and Debye-Hiickel linearization approximations are utilized. The resulting boundary value problem is shown to be controlled by a number of parameters including the electro-osmotic parameter, Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity (maximum electro-osmotic velocity), and Jefferys\' first parameter (ratio of relaxation and retardation time), wave amplitude. The influence of these parameters and also time on axial velocity, pressure difference, maximum volumetric flow rate and streamline distributions (for elucidating trapping phenomena) is visualized graphically and interpreted in detail. Pressure difference magnitudes are enhanced consistently with both increasing electro-osmotic parameter and Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity, whereas they are only elevated with increasing Jefferys\' first parameter for positive volumetric flow rates. Maximum time averaged flow rate is enhanced with increasing electro-osmotic parameter, Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity and Jefferys\' first parameter. Axial flow is accelerated in the core (plug) region of the conduit with greater values of electro-osmotic parameter and Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity whereas it is significantly decelerated with increasing Jefferys\' first parameter.

Major cities of India were industrialized and required more work force in metropolitan cities, leading to uncoordinated and unplanned growth, often termed as urban sprawl. Urban sprawl destroyed the natural resources such as open green space, agricultural land, open water bodies and ground water. In this paper, an attempt has been made to monitor urban sprawl using Shannonâ€™s Entropy model, Remote Sensing, and GIS for city Jaipur, India. The changed entropy value during the years 1972-2013 proves more dispersed growth in the city. The built-up area of Jaipur has increased from 40 km2 in 1972 to 400 km2 in 2013. Land use percentage of urban settlement is doubled as compared to the urban population of Jaipur during 1972-2013. This study shows remarkable urban sprawl in fringe areas of Jaipur city in the last 41 years.

The microchannel walls are deformable and transmit periodic waves. The Chakraborty-Roy nanofluid electrokinetic formulation is adopted in which Joule heating effects are incorporated. Soret and Dufour cross-diffusion effects are also considered. Under low Reynolds number (negligible inertial effects), long wavelength and Debye linearization approximations, the governing partial differential equations for mass, momentum, energy and solute concentration conservation are derived with appropriate boundary conditions at the micro-channel walls. The merging model features a number of important thermo-physical, electrical and nanoscale parameter, namely thermal and solutal Grashof numbers, the Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity (maximum electro-osmotic velocity) and Joule heating to surface heat flux ratio. Closed-form solutions are derived for the solute concentration, temperature, axial velocity, averaged volumetric flow rate, pressure difference across one wavelength, and stream function distribution in the wave frame. Additionally expressions are presented for the surface shear stress function at the wall (skin friction coefficient), wall heat transfer rate (Nusselt number) and wall solute mass transfer rate (Sherwood number). The influence of selected parameters on these flow variables is studied with the aid of graphs. Bolus formation is also visualized and analyzed in detail. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The flow of current in arc-discharge method varies in the range 50â€“200Â A. Further arc-synthesized carbon nanotubes are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and the results are compared with nanotubes grown by chemical vapor deposition method. XRD result shows a characteristic peak (0 0 2) at 26.54Â° corresponding to the presence of carbon nanotubes. SEM and TEM results give morphology of as-synthesized multi-walled nanotubes. TEM results indicate synthesis of well-graphitized carbon nanotubes by arc-discharge method. Dispersion of arc-synthesized nanotubes in SDS solution under the effect of different sonication times is studied. Dispersion of nanotubes in SDS solution is analyzed using UVâ€“visâ€“NIR spectroscopy and it shows an absorption peak at 260Â nm. It was found that with the increase in sonication time, the absorption peak in UVâ€“visâ€“NIR spectra will increase and optimum sonication time was 2 hours. Functionalization of synthesized carbon nanotubes by H2SO4 and HNO3 acids has been studied and analysis of functionalized groups has been done using FT-IR spectroscopy and compared and the results are reported in this paper.

The Poisson-Boltzmann equation for electric potential distribution is implemented to accommodate the electrical double layer in the microchannel.

The solution of the electrical potential is based on the Debye- HÃ¼ckel approximation for a symmetric (Z: Z) electrolyte solution. Closed form solutions for axial velocity, pressure gradient, pressure rise along one wavelength and stream function are derived. To examine the influence of physical parameters like Bingham plug flow width, electroosmotic parameter and Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity on pumping characteristics, computational results are illustrated. With vanishing yield stress, the Newtonian case is retrieved. An increase in plug flow width is observed to decrease volumetric flow rate and has a varied influence on the pressure rise depending on whether the flow is in the free pumping or pumping region.

The Jeffrey viscoelastic model is utilized which features both relaxation and retardation terms of relevance to real polymers. A magnetic body force is incorporated for the influence of static radial magnetic field. The mass and momentum conservation equations are formulated in an intrinsic coordinate system and transformed with appropriate variables into a nondimensional system between the wave and the laboratory frames, under lubrication (i.e., low Reynolds number and long wavelength) approximations. Kinematic and no-slip boundary conditions are imposed at the channel walls. A magnetic body force is incorporated for the influence of static radial magnetic field in the primary momentum equation. An analytic approach is employed to determine closed-form solutions for stream function, axial pressure gradient, and volumetric flow rate. Spatiotemporal plots for pressure distribution along the channel (passage) length are presented to study the influences of curvature parameter, relaxation-to-retardation time ratio (Jeffrey first viscoelastic parameter) and Hartmann number (magnetic field parameter). The effects of these parameters on radial velocity distributions are also visualized. Cases of trapping and reflux in a curved channel are discussed. Streamline distributions are included to study trapping phenomena and to investigate more closely the impact of curvature, magnetic field, and viscoelastic properties on bolus evolution.

Double-diffusive convection in the asymmetric microchannel is also carried out. The walls of the microchannel are propagating with a finite phase difference in a sinusoidal manner. Rosseland diffusion flux model is employed to examine the thermal radiation effect. The zeta potential on the walls is considered very low to apply HÃ¼ckelâ€“Debye approximations. The coupled non-linear governing equations are simplified by using dimensional analysis and lubrication theory. The closed form solutions for potential function, nanoparticle fraction field, solute concentration field, temperature field, stream function, and axial velocity are derived under the appropriate boundary conditions. It is noteworthy that the pumping characteristics strongly depend on the magnetic fields, electric fields, electric double layer thickness, Jeffery parameter, thermal radiation and Grashof number. Furthermore, trapping phenomenon is analyzed under the effects of Hartmann number, Jeffrey parameter, Grashof number and Helmholtzâ€“Smoluchowski velocity.

With the advancement in the technological aspects of the communication mechanism, the textual form of data has taken the shape of audiovisual format, and more and more content over internet is being shared in this form. Data sharing in this form calls for the need of high bandwidth consumption which may slow down the network resulting in performance degradation of content delivery networks due to congestion. Several attempts have been made by the researchers to propose various techniques and algorithms to achieve optimal performance of the network resources under high-usage circumstances. But due to high-dense network architectures, the performance implementations of suggested algorithms for congestion may not be able to produce the desired results in real time. In this paper, we have presented an optimized multi-core architecture-based parallel version of two congestion control algorithmsâ€”leaky bucket and choke packet. The experimental results over a dense network show that optimized parallel implementation using OpenMP programming specification gets the network rebalancing in a very short span of time as compared to its serial counterpart. The proposed approach runs 60% faster than the serial implementation. The graphical map for the speed up continues to increase with the size of the network and routers.

As old engines (Euro III or earlier) produce more emissions and it will be difficult to entirely stop their usage especially in developing and underdeveloped nations, it is desired that appropriate emission reduction technologies are tested on such engines to analyze their feasibility and economical acceptability. While most such studies have been conducted on constant speed stationary engines and modern engines, this study tried to analyze the effectiveness of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system on a Euro-1, water-cooled, direct injection, variable speed, compression ignition (C.I.) engine in a laboratory setup in India. This was done by testing an electronic control unit (ECU)-controlled EGR valve running the engine on different speeds; with different torques, as also with varying EGR percentages. Then optimum value of EGR valve opening for each set of engine speed and torque was determined, that is, corresponding to minimum oxides of nitrogen (NOx). Optimum EGR valve position was programmatically fed, for each set of torque and engine speed (in RPM), into EGR ECU and then the engine was run at varying speeds and torques and the emissions were verified in the automated mode. It was found that using EGR, NOx emissions were substantially reduced (average 45\\% reduction), without significantly impacting the engine performance. However, smoke emission increased with EGR. In order to counter the adverse effects, additional emission reduction technologies should be used in tandem with EGR.

An integrated approach has been used to incorporate ultrafineÂ fluorcanasite (FC) glass-ceramic particulates within nanocellulose matrix, synthesized from lignocellulosic biomass. Epichlorohydrin (ECH) was used as a chemical cross-linking agent for hydrogel synthesis. The compositions and properties of bio-nanocomposite hydrogels were controlled by varying the loading of FC and ECH. Moreover, microstructural characterizations and functional group analysis of synthesized nanocellulose and bio-nanocomposite hydrogels were carried out using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). SEM studies revealed successful extraction of cellulosic nanofibres and interconnected porous micro-architecture of injectable hydrogels. Incorporation of FC particulates resulted into development of well-defined micro-porous morphology. FT-IR studies indicated the presence of hydroxyl groups and possible interactions between nanocellulose and FC reinforcements. The rheological study of the developed injectable hydrogel was carried out at different frequency, amplitude and temperature sweeps. The studies revealed that after the incorporation of FC, dynamic storage modulus increased, while synergistically enhancing the injectability of the bio-nanocomposite hydrogels. An optimum loading level of FC reinforcement could also be established. Swelling behaviour studies of the hydrogels demonstrated higher degree of swelling and enhanced structural integrity with incorporation of FC. The novel bio-nanocomposite injectable hydrogels developed in this study,Â could demonstrate promising potential as injectable implant material.

The inclusion of frequency doubling effect (counter rotating term) in the conventional rotating wave approximation (RWA) changes the resonance condition thereby producing a rather small shift in the resonance condition, which is known as the Bloch-Siegert shift (BSS). Rabi oscillations in Dirac-Weyl fermionic systems exhibit anomalous behavior far from resonance, called anomalous Rabi oscillations. Therefore, in the present work, we study the phenomenon of the Bloch-Siegert shift in Weyl semimetal and topological insulator (TI) far from resonance, called anomalous Bloch-Siegert shift (ABSS). It is seen that the change in the resonance condition of anomalous Rabi oscillations is drastic in Weyl semimetal and TI. The ABSS in Weyl semimetals is highly anisotropic, whereas it is isotropic in TI. In case of TI, it is the Chern number which plays a crucial role to produce substantial change in the ABSS.

In addition, the band alignment, optical gain and lasing wavelength are also studied under the effect of applied external electric field ranging from 10 to 200 kV/cm and variable temperature.

In hierarchical NEMO, due to the high degree of nesting in mobile network, pinball routing problem, inefficient route and end to end delay in packet transmission are quite common.

In this paper, a parallel version of this ordering algorithm over CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) has been discussed by identifying an approach to process-independent portions of the graph simultaneously for load flow analysis over radial distribution networks. The serial implementation of topological sort has been first discussed followed by its implementation on thread-block architecture of CUDA modifying the serial algorithm.

The model was trained on images of various hand gestures in a multi-class classification setting. This allows the user to choose a custom trigger gesture for oneself. To test the efficiency of such a model in the trigger detection process, we have made 7,000 videos (each 10s long) consisting of random images from the test set which were never shown to the model during the training process. It is experimentally shown that such a system has a better performance than the other state-of-the art techniques used in static hand gesture image recognition tasks. This approach also finds real-time application and can be applied to develop small scale devices which trigger any particular response by capturing the gestures made by the people.

The growth rates of both the instabilities are enhanced by the magnetic field but their magnitudes attain a minimum value at certain angles of the wave propagation depending upon the wavelength of oscillations. At a critical value of ionization rate there is a sudden fall in the growth of both the instabilities, the reason of which is understood as the Landau damping. A further enhancement in the ionization suppresses the usual TSI whereas the magnetic field-driven instability attains much lower growth.

Web-based software projects are different than conventional projects, and hence the task of estimation is a complex one. It is observed that the literature does not provide a guidance to the analysts to use a particular model for effort estimation of this type of applications.

Ovarian Cancer, Lymphomas & Leukemia. For optimal gene selection, ReliefF method is used as a filter based gene selection and Random gene subset selection algorithm is used as a wrapper based gene selection.

The crystallinity, bonding behavior and disorder in the films were investigated with X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), UVâ€“visible and ellipsometry techniques, while surface morphology was studied using Atomic force microscopy (AFM). The nanocrystalline nature of PMMA is seen to be preserved in the blends although there are clear indications of bond modifications. The addition of PCTFE results in the improvement of overall crystallinity of the films via the interaction among PMMA and degraded PCTFE molecules when the films are casted from diluted solutions. In agreement, corresponding disorder in terms of Urbach energy shows a decreasing trend upon inclusion of more and more PCTFE molecules. Micro-Raman spectra are dominated by fluorescence background, which is proposed as arising from degraded PCTFE. Supporting this, FTIR spectra also shows modifications in bonding as a function of PCTFE percentage, but this bond modification is not enough to produce refractive index variation in the sample, which is dominated by the host PMMA contribution for all the PCTFE concentrations. The study suggests the useful range of PCTFE concentration in which PMMA host properties can be modified for optimizing optical and structural properties without much degradation of PCTFE.

Moreover, sensors S1 and S2 also recognize fluoride ions via H-bond interaction and subsequent deprotonation to elicit a color change from colorless to yellow conspicuous to the naked eye. Detailed UV-visible analyses revealed that the sensors interact with copper ions in a 1: 1 binding stoichiometry with a detection range of 10-7 M. In addition, competing binding studies by UV-visible analyses revealed that the sensors exhibit more selectivity toward copper ions in comparison to fluoride ions.

Asbestos a naturally occurring fibrous mineral declared a Group I definite carcinogen by IARC (International Agency for Research on Cancer), a unit of WHO in the year 1987, has been extensively used since World War II to the near past for various commercial products. According to the most recent World Health Organization (WHO) estimates, asbestos-related diseases, resulting from exposure at workplace claims more than 107000 lives every year worldwide. The various types of toxic effects induced by asbestos in humans include - i) inflammation and fibrogenesis of lung, ii) mesothelioma iii) asbestosis and iv) bronchogenic carcinoma. The stability of asbestos in natural environment and its biological aggressiveness is related to their fibrous structure and dimensions. The actual risk associated with the exposure to nanosized asbestos, which is still unknown and escapes most regulations worldwide, has been shown in various toxicity assessment studies conducted on various animal models.In an effort to reduce the size of asbestos and therby its toxicity by limiting its biopersistence, oxalic acid treatment of asbestos coupled to power ultrasound treatment was carried out. The nanosized particles formed were still found to retain their hazardous effect. Similar were the results obtained on strong acid treatment of asbestos as well. A probable solution to the asbestos toxicity problem therefore envisaged was bioremediation. This involved the secretion of iron chelating molecules termed siderophores by microbes, which are of significance due to their ability to form very stable and soluble complexes with iron. Iron in asbestos composition is a major factor responsible for its carcinogenicity, removal or extraction of which would prove to be an effective answer to the worldwide problem. Siderophores are low molecular weight organic compounds with a very high and specific affinity to chelate iron and enhance their diffusion to the microbial cell surface. A number of successful experiments carried out in vitro have shown positive results concerning reduction in asbestos toxicity on chelation of iron by siderophores. The present investigation tends to put forth the aspect of these biomolecules secreted by specific bacteria and fungi as potent tools to fight the micro to nano sized asbestos fibre toxicity.

Firstly, the governing flow problem is described by continuity and momentum equations in the presence of electrokinetic forces in Cartesian coordinates, then long wavelength and low/zero Reynolds (neglecting the inertial forces) approximations are applied to modify the governing flow problem. The resulting differential equations are solved analytically in order to obtain exact solutions for velocity profile whereas the numerical integration is carried out to analyze the pumping characteristics. The physical behaviour of sundry parameters is discussed for velocity profile, pressure rise and volume flow rate. In particular, the behaviour of electro-osmotic parameter, phase difference, and Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity is examined and discussed.

In this paper, we introduce a new ranking algorithm that computes the rank of a task, based on its successor rank and its predecessors average communication time, instead of its successors rank. The advantage of this ranking algorithm is that two dependent tasks are assigned to the same machine and as a result the scheduled length is reduced. The task selection phase selects a ready task from each workflow and creates a task pool. The resource selection phase initially assigns tasks using min-min heuristic, after initial assignment, tasks are moved from the highly loaded machines to the lightly loaded machines. Our resource selection algorithm increases the load balance among the resources due to tasks assignment heuristic and reassignment of tasks from the highly loaded machines.

Stokes\' couple stress fluid model is employed to represent realistic working liquids. The Poisson-Boltzmann equation for electric potential distribution is implemented owing to the presence of an electrical double layer (EDL) in the micro-channel. Using long wavelength, lubrication theory and Debye-Huckel approximations, the linearized transformed dimensionless boundary value problem is solved analytically. The influence of electro-osmotic parameter (inversely proportional to Debye length), maximum electro-osmotic velocity (a function of external applied electrical field) and couple stress parameter on axial velocity, volumetric flow rate, pressure gradient, local wall shear stress and stream function distributions is evaluated in detail with the aid of graphs. The Newtonian fluid case is retrieved as a special case with vanishing couple stress effects. With increasing the couple stress parameter there is a significant increase in the axial pressure gradient whereas the core axial velocity is reduced. An increase in the electro-osmotic parameter both induces flow acceleration in the core region (around the channel centreline) and it also enhances the axial pressure gradient substantially.

While most such studies have been conducted on constant speed stationary engines and modern engines, this study tried to analyze the effectiveness of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system on a Euro-1, water-cooled, direct injection, variable speed, compression ignition (C.I.) engine in a laboratory setup in India. This was done by testing an electronic control unit (ECU)-controlled EGR valve running the engine on different speeds; with different torques, as also with varying EGR percentages. Then optimum value of EGR valve opening for each set of engine speed and torque was determined, that is, corresponding to minimum oxides of nitrogen (NOx). Optimum EGR valve position was programmatically fed, for each set of torque and engine speed (in RPM), into EGR ECU and then the engine was run at varying speeds and torques and the emissions were verified in the automated mode. It was found that using EGR, NOx emissions were substantially reduced (average 45% reduction), without significantly impacting the engine performance. However, smoke emission increased with EGR. In order to counter the adverse effects, additional emission reduction technologies should be used in tandem with EGR.

In silico models assumed normal strain as the stimulus to predict the sites of new bone formation. These models, however, may fail to fit the amount of newly formed bone. Loading parameters such as strain, frequency, and loading cycle decide the amount of new bone formation. The models did not incorporate this information. In fact, there is no unifying relationship to quantify the amount of new bone formation as a function of loading parameters. Therefore, the present work aims to establish an empirical relationship between loading parameters and a new bone formation parameter i.e. mineral apposition rate (MAR). A neural network model is used to serve the purpose. Loading parameters are supplied as input, whereas, MAR served as output. The model is trained and tested with experimental data. The model establishes an empirical relationship to estimate MAR as a function of loading parameters. The model\'s predictions of MAR align with in vivo experimental results. The model\'s response is analyzed which indicates that the bone adaptation characteristics are successfully captured in the relationship.

However, we identified that the inherent features of ICN also causes new vulnerabilities in the network. In this paper, we first propose a novel attack called as Bitrate Oscillation Attack (BOA), which exploits fundamental ICN characteristics: in-network caching and interest aggregation, to disrupt DASH functionality. In particular, the proposed attack forces the bitrate and resolution of video received by the attacked client to oscillate with high frequency and high amplitude during the streaming process. To detect and mitigate BOA, we design and implement a reactive countermeasure called Fair-RTT-DAS. Our solution ensures efficient bandwidth utilisation and improves the user perceived Quality of Experience (QoE) in the presence of varying content source locations. For this purpose, Fair-RTT-DAS consider DASH\'s two significant features: round-trip-time (RTT) and throughput fairness. In the presence of BOA in a network, our simulation results show an increase in the annoyance factor in user\'s spatial dimension, i.e., increase in oscillation frequency and amplitude. The results also show that our countermeasure significantly alleviates these adverse effects and makes dynamic adaptive streaming friendly to ICN\'s implicit features.

In reality different land covers within a pixel can be found due to continuum of variation in landscape and intrinsic mixed nature of most classes. Mixed pixels may not be appropriately processed by traditional image classifiers, which assume that pixels are pure. The existence of mixed pixels led to the development of several approaches for soft (often termed fuzzy in the remote sensing literature) classification in which each pixel is allocated to all classes in varying proportions. However, while the proportions of each land cover within each pixel may be predicted, the spatial location of each land cover within each pixel is not. Thus, it is important to develop and implement a classifier that can work as soft classifiers for landslide identification. This work is an attempt to document and identify landslide areas by five spectral indices using temporal multi-spectral images from IRS-P6 LISS-IV images. To improve the spectral properties of spectral indices for specific class identification (in this case landslide) a Class Based Sensor Independent (CBSI) technique proposed. The result indicates that CBSI based Transformed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (TNDVI) temporal indices data gives better results for landslide identification with minimum entropy and membership range.

The long wavelength, creeping (low Reynolds number) and Debyeâ€“HÃ¼ckel linearization approximations are utilized. The resulting boundary value problem is shown to be controlled by a number of parameters including the electro-osmotic parameter, Helmholtzâ€“Smoluchowski velocity (maximum electro-osmotic velocity), and Jefferysâ€™ first parameter (ratio of relaxation and retardation time), wave amplitude. The influence of these parameters and also time on axial velocity, pressure difference, maximum volumetric flow rate and streamline distributions (for elucidating trapping phenomena) is visualized graphically and interpreted in detail. Pressure difference magnitudes are enhanced consistently with both increasing electro-osmotic parameter and Helmholtzâ€“Smoluchowski velocity, whereas they are only elevated with increasing Jefferysâ€™ first parameter for positive volumetric flow rates. Maximum time averaged flow rate is enhanced with increasing electro-osmotic parameter, Helmholtzâ€“Smoluchowski velocity and Jefferysâ€™ first parameter. Axial flow is accelerated in the core (plug) region of the conduit with greater values of electro-osmotic parameter and Helmholtzâ€“Smoluchowski velocity whereas it is significantly decelerated with increasing Jefferysâ€™ first parameter.

In this paper, we propose using texture descriptors extracted from the nucleus image for detection of ALL. The disease causes change in the chromatin distribution of the nucleus, which can be observed in the form of texture. We have used two texture features, namely Local Binary pattern and Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix for automatic detection of ALL. A comparative analysis of both the features is presented. It is seen that LBP features perform better than GLCM features.

Fly ash samples exhibit an average HIRM value (400.07 Ã— 10âˆ’5Â Am2Â kgâˆ’1) that is comparable to that of soil samples. The pre- and post-monsoon samples show a consistent reduction in the concentration of magnetically â€œhardâ€ minerals with increasing distance from the power plant. These data suggest that fly ash has indeed been transported from the power plant to the sampling locations. Hence, HIRM may perhaps be used as a proxy for tracking fly ash from coal-fired thermal power plants. Seasonal data show that the distribution of fly ash to the surrounding areas is minimum during monsoons. They also point to the dominance of SP magnetite in early-monsoon season, whereas magnetic depletion is documented in the monsoon season. This seasonal difference is attributable to both pedogenesis and anthropogenic activity i.e. operation of the thermal power plant.

Almost 60%-80% of the children coming to pediatric and endocrinology outpatient department for the evaluation of short stature are still labeled as idiopathic. Objectives: The aim of this study is to identify various chromosomal alterations causing idiopathic short stature (ISS) and short stature with dysmorphic features not pertaining to known genetic syndromes. Materials and Methods: After exclusion of all nutritional, systemic, endocrine, and syndromic causes of short stature, 19 patients with height <2 standard deviation scores were subjected to chromosomal microarray (CMA) study using Affymetrix CytoScan 750K array and CMA Scanner 3000 platform. Results: We identified total 61 copy-number variant (CNV) and polymorphs (33 gains, 11 loss, and 17 gain-mosaics) not described as normal variants in database of genomic variations. We identified SHOX haploinsufficiency as a cause of short stature in two patients, whereas one patient was gain-mosaic for SHOX. All three had normal conventional karyotype. One of these patients also had deletion of PAX3, which could be the cause of both short stature and associated mild intellectual impairment in this patient. We also found a long noncoding RNA, namely, KIAA0125 and a pseudogene ADAM6 in 18 out of our 19 patients which might have a regulatory role. Conclusion: This study shows that CMA is a very promising tool for the identification of pathogenic CNVs in patients with ISS. It can also help to identify novel genes controlling height and can open up new insight into pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying ISS, and thus may help to unfold new therapeutic targets for treatment of this condition. The association of CNV having genes for long noncoding RNAs, such as KIAA0125 and pseudogene such as ADAM6 with ISS suggest that they may play a role in controlling the expression of height-related genes and it needs further investigations.

A L9 array was used to analyse the response of pressure-crank angle gradient \"dp/dÎ¸\" as the output variable. From the Taguchi analysis of the effect of the three parameters, injection timing was the most dominant factor for the rise in the pressure gradient followed by boost pressure ratio and compression ratio as the lowest dominant factors. A contour of dp/dÎ¸ showed injection timing of 12Â° BTDC as the most optimum timing for maximum rise in pressure.

The core concept is in placing stretch sensors, pressure sensors and accelerometer at strategic location to collect the responses. The sensor\'s response is studied toidentify linearity and repeatability, using which, reliability of data is determined. Further, appropriate Machine learning algorithms can be employed to classify different set of activities.

Even though, currently some applications are using the marker (glyph) less AR system, there are challenges in the detection of object in real-time application and to overcome this complication, the glyph detection system is proposed.

Three different layers i.e. the core layer, intermediate layer and peripheral layer are simulated with three different viscosities for each fluid layer. The unsteady two-dimensional conservation equations for mass and momentum with electrokinetic body forces, are transformed from the wave frame to the laboratory frame and the electrical field terms are rendered into electrical potential terms via the Poisson-Boltzmann equation, Debye length approximation and ionic Nernst-Planck equation. The dimensionless emerging linearized electrokinetic boundary value problem is solved using integral methods. Closed-form expressions are derived for stream functions in the core, intermediate and peripheral layers. Expressions are also derived for the core-intermediate interface shape and the intermediate-peripheral interface shape. Maximum pressures are also computed. To study bolus migration, the range of the trapping limit is also determined in the peripheral layer. It is found that in the core layer larger boluses are computed in the case of lower intermediate layer viscosity relative to peripheral layer viscosity although the number of boluses is greater when the intermediate layer viscosity exceeds the peripheral layer viscosity. Furthermore, in the intermediate layer, stronger concentration of streamlines is computed in the lower half space with positive Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity. Also negative Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity reduces the core layer (H-1) interface shape whereas it enhances the peripheral layer (H) and intermediate layer (H-2) shapes. At lower values of volume flow rate ratio, hydromechanical efficiency is maximum for positive Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity whether intermediate layer viscosity is less or greater than peripheral layer viscosity. Finally, greater with greater peristaltic wave amplitude and also for positive Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity there is an increase in time-averaged flow rate, whether intermediate layer viscosity is less or greater than peripheral layer viscosity.

The prompt upsurge of the Indian population will force people to migrate from the rural area to the mega cities, to avail basic amenities.

In addition, the optical gain of the structure within TE (transverse electric) and TM (transverse magnetic) modes under constant electric field applied is also simulated and analyzed. In order to simulate the optical gain of the structure, 4Â Ã—Â 4 diagonal kâ†’.Pâ†’ Hamiltonian matrix is solved for the purpose of getting envelope functions associated with carriers, carrier densities, dispersion curves of the quantum well structure, transition matrix elements and finally the optical gain. On behalf of simulated results achieved, it is reported that the optical gain in TM mode is found much greater than that in TE mode which is opposite to usual trends. Moreover, the application of external electric field along the growth direction shows that the optical gain within TM mode and the wavelength both can be controlled by controlling the electric field applied. Thus, the nano-heterostructure can be tuned externally by the application of external electric field within the NIR (near infra red) region.

The proposed work is a two-step method, firstly the siting and sizing of DG is obtained by two stage Genetic Algorithm (GA) to improve the voltage profile and to reduce the active power losses. A two stage GA ensures a faster convergence and better quality of solutions. Finally the proposed improved hybrid method is applied to detect the bus most susceptible for islanding under varying operating conditions. The improved hybrid islanding detection method utilizes the positive features of existing active and passive methods simultaneously.

India continues to be a key growth market among global corporates and this is reflective in the steady growth in demand for prime office space. A recent trend that has been noted is the increase in demand for office spaces not just in major cities but also in smaller tier II and Tier III cities. Growth in the commercial building sector projects a rising trend of energy intensive mechanical systems in office buildings in India. The air conditioning market in India is growing at 25% annually. This is due to the ever increasing demand to maintain thermal comfort in tropical regions. Air conditioning is one of the most energy intensive technologies which are used in buildings. As a result India is witnessing significant spike in energy demand and further widening the demand supply gap. Challenge in India is to identify passive measures in building envelope design in office buildings to reduce the cooling loads and conserve energy.

In order to overcome the problem of energy consumption, a well-known clustering algorithm, LEACH (Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy) was designed. However, LEACH has some disadvantages. In this paper, we propose a new clustering algorithm based on LEACH. It establishes a new Threshold which includes the node energy and distance between node and base station and distance between cluster head and base station for measuring the threshold value. Simulation results show that proposed algorithm is better than LEACH in balancing the node energy and thus enhancing the network lifetime.

The study employed DPSIR methods outlined in the OECD report, which state that Indicators measure the decoupling of environmental pressure from economic growth for analyzing environmental pressure/degradation indicators, such as population growth, energy production, greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, CO2emission, SOx emission, NOx emission, water abstraction and waste with economic indicator, i.e., nominal and per capita GDP. The major finding of this study is that among the selected indicators, some resulted from relative decoupling rather than absolute decoupling, which means that the environmental pressure still increases, albeit at a lower rate than economic performance, and that the presence of decoupling is not an indication for sustainable economic development.

There is a tendency of Apps user to trust on Android OS for securing his/her data but it has been proved that Android OS is more vulnerable to exploitation either for fun or for monetary purpose. Malware detection for Android OS has become an upcoming research problem of interest. Dynamic Taint Analysis is an efficient analysis in existing Android malware detection analysis. The aim of this paper is to work towards Dynamic Taint Analysis of Android malware using automatic tagging and with out modification in Android platform. In order to do this, this paper surveys exhaustively the available literature and works related to dynamic taint analysis. This paper proposes some novel ideas to improve the existing solution with more accuracy. There are two phases of our novel algorithm, the first phase is training phase for feature extraction and the second phase is the analysis phase for automatic tagging and tainting. We have developed a framework named AndroTaint, which is working on Dynamic Taint Analysis. AndroTaint follows a novel supervised and unsupervised Anomaly Detection technique with high precision, recall and harmonic mean. Our Dynamic Taint Analysis algorithm categorizes the App is risky, benign, malicious or aggressive as per their feature and behaviour. We have measured AndroTaint effectiveness on the basis of timeline for building dataset and 10-fold cross validation. AndroTaint covers 90% of malware and benign in analysis phase with less false positive and false negative.

The Raman 3D mapping depth profile along with time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry also indicated important structural and surface modifications, which could be correlated to the production of microbial exopolysaccharides and secondary metabolites. The study then looked into any possible genetic mutation and ecological risks associated with the biosynthetically modified polysaccharide through the investigation of genotoxicity and ecotoxicity. The genotoxicity study was carried out through bacterial reverse gene mutation (Ames) test by using two different strains (TA98 and TA100) of bacteria. The results did not indicate any mutagenic effect against either of the strains used for the biopolymer samples and was found to be genotoxically safe. Ecotoxicity tests, carried out using bioluminescent bacteria Vibrio fisheri further indicated no ecotoxicity within the given experimental conditions. The study measured the half maximal effective concentration (EC50) to cause a 50% decrease in the light output of the bacteria, a measure of ecotoxicological response of the biopolymer. Overall, results from this study indicated that the novel biopolymer was genotoxically and ecotoxically safe, which offers immense potential for future use of this biopolymer.

The sector provides strong incentives for vertical integration due to economies of scope. However, it is evident from the literature that large integrated PPPs in railway systems are not feasible due to higher commercial risks. They also suffer from implicit cross subsidization since the railway infrastructure is capital intensive, common to multiple revenue sources, and fare box revenues are generally not sufficient to recover investments. This is being addressed by various unbundling approaches in recent PPPs. The common unbundling is between infrastructure, operations, and services.The objective of this research is to explore the potential of unbundling further and to come up with a framework that helps policy makers in taking macro level decisions on PPP structuring. The research disaggregates the railway system into over 40 \'elements\' wherein an element is the smallest unit that can be given to a party for execution. However this unbundling would result in significant horizontal and vertical interfaces between these elements.A sustainable PPP would need to limit the extent of interfaces due to transaction costs and risks. This can be achieved by bundling the elements horizontally and/or vertically into \'entities\' to extract the best value for a PPP. The governing principles would be scale economies (horizontal integration), scope economies (vertical integration), need for competition (horizontal disaggregation), level playing field, transactional transparency, and need for specialization (vertical disaggregation). Additional drivers would be appetite for investment, availability of competence and accountability for an entity. The findings of the research indicate that the entity formation is one of the most crucial aspects of a PPP in railways.A consequential critical area is managing the interfaces between entities, which are subject to transaction costs and risks. These should be carefully identified and addressed by well-designed contractual agreements and independent regulation.

However, we identified that the inherent features of ICN also causes new vulnerabilities in the network. In this paper, we first propose a novel attack called as Bitrate Oscillation Attack (BOA), which exploits fundamental ICN characteristics: in-network caching and interest aggregation, to disrupt DASH functionality. In particular, the proposed attack forces the bitrate and resolution of video received by the attacked client to oscillate with high frequency and high amplitude during the streaming process. To detect and mitigate BOA, we design and implement a reactive countermeasure called Fair-RTT-DAS. Our solution ensures efficient bandwidth utilisation and improves the user perceived Quality of Experience (QoE) in the presence of varying content source locations. For this purpose, Fair-RTT-DAS consider DASH\'s two significant features: round-trip-time (RTT) and throughput fairness. In the presence of BOA in a network, our simulation results show an increase in the annoyance factor in user\'s spatial dimension, i.e., increase in oscillation frequency and amplitude. The results also show that our countermeasure significantly alleviates these adverse effects and makes dynamic adaptive streaming friendly to ICN\'s implicit features.', '', '', 'ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV', '0140-3664', '', '', '', 'Journal', '', 'NO', 'SCI', 'NO', 'NO', '', 1, '', '2019-02-08 10:25:35', '27787NA2019-02-08 10:25:35'),

The multi-term general fractional diffusion equation containing force terms and a time dependent absorbent term is taken into account. Fractional calculus is applied to describe the phenomenon of sub-diffusion of oxygen in both transverse and longitudinal directions. A new computational algorithm, i.e., the new iterative method (NIM) is employed to solve the spatio-temporal fractional partial differential equation subject to appropriate physical boundary conditions. Validation of NIM solutions is achieved with a modified adomian decomposition method (MADM). A parametric study is conducted for three loading scenarios on the capillary-radial force alone, axial force alone and the combined case of both forces. The results demonstrate that the force terms markedly influence the oxygen diffusion process. For example, the radial force exerts a more profound effect than axial force on sub-diffusion of oxygen indicating that careful manipulation of these forces on capillary-tissues may assist in the effective reduction of hypoxia or other oxygen depletion phenomena.

The surface sterilized leaf explants after staining with lactophenol cotton blue showed the presence of endophytic fungi in intercellular spaces of ground, dermal tissue especially in midrib region. Leaves have shown dense colonies of endophytic fungi. Microscopic examination of in vitro and in vivo leaves has shown mycelium which was dense, branched and septate. Hence, the comparative study was conducted in both in vitro and in vivo leaves of T. cordifolia to locate endophytic fungi. The present study revealed that the fungi are not only developed in plants under natural environment but also under controlled conditions i.e. tissue culture of plants. Therefore, the present research work favoured the view that endophytes can infect nutrient medium of in vitro culture of T. cordifolia and diversity of endophytic fungi increase after hardening and acclimatization of T. cordifolia plantlets. The presence of endophytes in in vitro cultures depends both on age of tissue and host genotype. Further studies are required to isolate the endophytic fungi, pure culture on PDA plates and their identification to explore their biosynthetic pathway.

Our aim is to replace SPICE simulation with our proposed surrogate models, which can be used to evaluate samples generated by sampling methods in variation space. Our methodology initiates by first characterizing the leakage of basic transistor stacks and then provides estimate of the leakage of basic gates based on these stacks. Transistor stacks are extracted across various standard cells, which are used to estimate leakage of CMOS gates with different input vector combinations. We develop Support Vector Machine (SVM) regression surrogate models and characterize the transistor stacks of CMOS gates, while accounting the combined effect of process variations in transistor length (L), threshold voltage (Vth), oxide thickness (Tox), supply voltage (0.6Vâˆ’1.2V), temperature (0Â°Câˆ’100Â°C) and width (28nmâˆ’200nm), all scalable at the same time. For gates containing parallel transistor stacks, we merge the parallel transistors having identical inputs, which in turn allows us to use precharacterized basic stacks for leakage calculation, thus avoiding generation of new models. Our experiments illustrate that we only require 30 and 26 stack models to predict the subthreshold and gate tunneling leakage of 20 different gates across 176 input combinations, instead of characterizing leakage model for each input vector separately. SVM regression models generated in our approach have the ability to predict the leakage with maximum average error of 2.7% in mean (Î¼) and maximum average error of 3.1% in standard deviation (Ïƒ), both for OAI22 gate. Our results establish that there is on an average 10Ã— improvement in runtime while estimating the Î¼ and Ïƒ of leakage of a gate within 10000 Monte Carlo simulation loop. Our approaches also result into a maximum of 221Ã— runtime improvement for C6288 ISCAS\'85 benchmark circuit. We further develop Sparse SVM models using Support Vector spectrum pruning method, which reduces the runtime of the regression models with negligible increase in the error. Runtime efficiency of 17Ã— and 323Ã— is achieved on standard cell library and C6288 benchmark circuit respectively using Sparse SVM models. Our models outperform previous models based on analytical equations and Artificial Neural Network in terms of accuracy.

In this paper, an extensive study of the effect of DG placement and sizing is performed by dividing the system into different zones to obtain a reduced effect of islanding. The siting and sizing of DG is carried out to improve the overall voltage profile or/and reduction in active power loss using two stage Genetic Algorithm (GA). In the first stage a basic knockout selection is considered and the best population is taken for next stage, where roulette selection for crossover and mutation is performed for optimal placement and sizing of DGs. The effect of the islanding, due to load variations is reduced by optimal siting and sizing of DG.

Recent studies depict that the performance of network and its utilization can be enhanced by QoS (Quality of Service) routing protocol. Thus, QoS is the essence of the WSNs. So, in this paper, we would like to present a detailed survey of the various routing protocols which play a vital role in attaining the QoS in WSNs. Methods: There are various levels of QoS which are required by the WSNs depending on the applications that they focus upon. The QoS support to WSNs can be achieved by various routing protocols. Thus, a detailed research on various routing protocols is done depicting their strengths and weakness and a comparison table of various protocols on various parameters is provided. Results: The QoS basically aims to focus on the quality that is perceived by the users of various applications. The QoS facilitates the above aim in terms of delay, packet delivery ratio, reduction in power of the sensor nodes, energy efficiency, bandwidth utilization, amount of through put generated and many other factors. However, there are few challenges faced by QoS which may occur due to dynamic topology and constrained resources. Even after these challenges the research suggests QoS is undisputedly the essence of WSNs. Conclusion: The QoS is very advantageous as it helps in improving the service provided to the users, and is accountable in improving the quality of output perceived by the users of various applications. Researchers have started working to overcome the challenges of QoS with the aim to minimize its constraints and maximize its multiple objectives.

Under low Reynolds number (negligible inertial effects), long wavelength and Debye linearization approximations, the governing partial differential equations for mass, momentum, energy and solute concentration conservation are derived with appropriate boundary conditions at the micro-channel walls. The merging model features a number of important thermo-physical, electrical and nanoscale parameter, namely thermal and solutal Grashof numbers, the Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity (maximum electro-osmotic velocity) and Joule heating to surface heat flux ratio. Closed-form solutions are derived for the solute concentration, temperature, axial velocity, averaged volumetric flow rate, pressure difference across one wavelength, and stream function distribution in the wave frame. Additionally expressions are presented for the surface shear stress function at the wall (skin friction coefficient), wall heat transfer rate (Nusselt number) and wall solute mass transfer rate (Sherwood number). The influence of selected parameters on these flow variables is studied with the aid of graphs. Bolus formation is also visualized and analyzed in detail.

Numbers are very frequently spoken words where recognition of these words plays a major role in Telugu speech recognition. These spoken words are preprocessed using various techniques like de-noising, framing, sampling, transformations, and endpoint detection. Methods like mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and combined MFCC with modified group delay functions (MODGDF) are used for extracting the features. Extracted features are used for training and testing phase. Multilayer perceptron (MLP) and time lagged recurrent neural network (TLRN) patterns are trained and tested. Comparison is done for MLP and TLRN with the feature extraction techniques MFCC and MODGDF-MFCC. Integrated MODGDF-MFCC gives best accuracy in training and testing phases.

There is a single server who visits the system immediately as and when required. The server takes the unit under preventive maintenance after a maximum operation time at normal mode if one standby unit is available for operation. If the repair of the failed unit is not possible up to a maximum repair time, failed unit is replaced by new one. The failure time, maximum operation time and maximum repair time distributions of the unit are considered as exponentially distributed while repair and maintenance time distributions are considered as arbitrary. All random variables are statistically independent and repairs are perfect. Various measures of system effectiveness are obtained by using the technique of semi-Markov process and RPT.

The fleet system architecture consisting of different types of machine tools from various OEMs operated at different users, but supported by a single repair depot is considered. The prime objective of this paper is to jointly optimize the decisions of Level of Repair (LOR) i.e. repair/move/discard, and Preventive Maintenance (PM) schedules considering user\'s cost structure and shop floor policy parameters. It is observed that integrated PM and LOR approach gives better Life Cycle Cost (LCC) performance compared to isolated approaches. Also, the importance of user\'s cost structure and shop floor operations policy parameters in LOR and PM planning is evident from the results. The proposed approach is very useful for the machine tool manufacturers (i.e. OEM) who want to engage into long term maintenance contract with their customers. Integrating LOR and PM is a complex problem. The complexity further increases due to consideration of time dependent failure rate of the machine components, imperfect maintenance which brings partial restoration to the components/systems, and stochastic natures of model parameters. Consequently, a simulation based genetic algorithm approach is used to solve the problem.

It is therefore the cleanest possible, totally non-polluting fuel. This fact has led some people to propose an energy economy based entirely on hydrogen, in which hydrogen would replace gasoline, oil, natural gas, coal, and nuclear power. Hydrogen is a clean energy source. Therefore, in recent years, demand on hydrogen production has increased considerably. Electrolysis of water, steam reforming of hydrocarbons and auto-thermal processes are well-known methods for hydrogen gas production, but not cost-effective due to high energy requirements. As compare to chemical methods, biological production of hydrogen gas has significant advantages such as bio-photolysis of water by algae, dark and photo-fermentation of organic materials, usually carbohydrates by bacteria. New approach for bio-hydrogen production is dark and photo-fermentation process but with some major problems like dark and photo-fermentative hydrogen production is the raw material cost. By using suitable bio-process technologies hydrogen can be produced through carbohydrate rich, nitrogen deficient solid wastes such as cellulose and starch containing agricultural and food industry wastes and some food industry wastewaters such as cheese whey, olive mill and baker\'s yeast industry wastewaters. Utilization of aforementioned wastes for hydrogen production provides inexpensive energy generation with simultaneous waste treatment. This review article summarizes bio-hydrogen production from some waste materials with recent developments and relative advantages.

All the details over the design specifications and the problems incurred during the development of the humanoid are described under each module of the humanoid. Further details and results are given over the open source software of El Greco.

Three different layers i.e. the core layer, intermediate layer and peripheral layer are simulated with three different viscosities for each fluid layer. The unsteady two-dimensional conservation equations for mass and momentum with electrokinetic body forces, are transformed from the wave frame to the laboratory frame and the electrical field terms are rendered into electrical potential terms via the Poissonâ€“Boltzmann equation, Debye length approximation and ionic Nernstâ€“Planck equation. The dimensionless emerging linearized electrokinetic boundary value problem is solved using integral methods. Closed-form expressions are derived for stream functions in the core, intermediate and peripheral layers. Expressions are also derived for the coreâ€“intermediate interface shape and the intermediateâ€“peripheral interface shape. Maximum pressures are also computed. To study bolus migration, the range of the trapping limit is also determined in the peripheral layer. It is found that in the core layer larger boluses are computed in the case of lower intermediate layer viscosity relative to peripheral layer viscosity although the number of boluses is greater when the intermediate layer viscosity exceeds the peripheral layer viscosity. Furthermore, in the intermediate layer, stronger concentration of streamlines is computed in the lower half space with positive Helmholtzâ€“Smoluchowski velocity. Also negative Helmholtzâ€“Smoluchowski velocity reduces the core layer (H1) interface shape whereas it enhances the peripheral layer (H) and intermediate layer (H2) shapes. At lower values of volume flow rate ratio, hydromechanical efficiency is maximum for positive Helmholtzâ€“Smoluchowski velocity whether intermediate layer viscosity is less or greater than peripheral layer viscosity. Finally, greater with greater peristaltic wave amplitude and also for positive Helmholtzâ€“Smoluchowski velocity there is an increase in time-averaged flow rate, whether intermediate layer viscosity is less or greater than peripheral layer viscosity. The analysis is relevant to electro-kinetic hemodynamics and bio-micro-fluidics.

A WSN consist of thousands of nodes that make the installation of GPS on each sensor node expensive and moreover GPS will not provide exact localization results in an indoor environment. Manually configuring location reference on each sensor node is also not possible in the case of dense network This gives rise to a problem where the sensor nodes must identify its current location without using any special hardware like GPS and without the help of manual configuration. Localization techniques make the deployment of WSNs economical. Most of the localization techniques are carried out with the help of anchor node or beacon node, which knows its present location. Based on the location information provided by the anchor node or beacon node, other nodes localize themselves.

Blood is considered as a Bingham rheological aqueous ionic solution. An externally applied static axial electrical field is imposed on the system. The Poisson-Boltzmann equation for electrical potential distribution is implemented to accommodate the electrical double layer in the microvascular regime. With long wavelength, lubrication and Debye-HÃ¼ckel approximations, the boundary value problem is rendered non-dimensional. Analytical solutions are derived for the axial velocity, volumetric flow rate, pressure gradient, volumetric flow rate, averaged volumetric flow rate along one time period, pressure rise along one wavelength and stream function. A plug swidth is featured in the solutions. Via symbolic software (Mathematica), graphical plots are generated for the influence of Bingham plug flow width parameter, electrical Debye length and Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity (maximum electro-osmotic velocity) on the key hydrodynamic variables. This study reveals that blood flow rate accelerates with decreasing the plug width (i.e. viscoplastic nature of fluids) and also with increasing the Debye length parameter.

Furthermore, Au alloys constitute an important model system in the context of corrosion, dealloying, and stress corrosion cracking. Adsorbed self-assembled monolayers of thiol molecules inhibit the dealloying reaction. On thiol-modified Cu-Au alloys dealloying finally proceeds in a localized reaction instead of a homogeneous process. Using ethanethiols as an example, we show here that thiols can be effectively removed by application of anodic oxidation. Homogeneous porosity forms then after an oxidation step. In-situ X-ray diffraction and crystal truncation rod analysis of ethanethiol-modified Au (001) confirms that a bare Au surface is recovered after a similar oxidation step. In consequence, a multi-step dealloying process including complete initial thiol-layers as well as partially or fully re-cleaned surfaces can produce different micro-cracks, providing larger scale openings, and homogeneous nanoporous Au in between. Such hierarchically structured surfaces may show superior applicability for reactions where mass transport into the porous layer plays a decisive role for the reaction rate or detection probability.

Herein, an Imidazopyrimidine Dye, named, 4-amino-3-(phenyldiazenyl)benzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-2(1H)-one, (APIP) has been used as a copper corrosion inhibitor in 3.5 wt.% (by weight) NaCl solution. The present investigation provides a brief mechanistic overview of the electrochemical mechanism of copper in aerated NaCl solution, simulating a static marine environment, with and without addition of APIP inhibitor. Potentiodynamic polarization (PDP) results confirmed that the APIP can suppress copper corrosion effectively at low concentration in 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution with an inhibition efficiency of 92.79% due to adsorption, along with the prediction of electrochemical mechanism. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements showed that the corrosion inhibition of Cu proceeds via both diffusion and kinetic controlled processes. Adsorption of APIP on copper surface is well fit with the Langmuir isotherm model and mode of adsorption is proposed. Antimicrobial activity was also studied and the result obtained showed â€˜â€˜eco-friendlyâ€™â€™ nature of APIP. Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM), Energy dispersion X-ray (EDX) and Attenuated Total Reflectance-Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) observations of the copper surfaces confirmed the existence of adsorption of APIP thus can be potentially used in industries in which seawater is implied are numerous such as cooling water systems, desalination plants, power plants, and oil production units.

The robust Casson model is implemented to simulate viscoplastic behavior of fluids. The external magnetic field is oblique to the fluid flow direction. Viscous dissipation effects are included. The flow is controlled by the metachronal wave propagation generated by cilia beating on the inner walls of the channel. The mathematical formulation is based on deformation in longitudinal and transverse velocity components induced by the ciliary beating phenomenon with cilia assumed to follow elliptic trajectories. The model also features velocity and thermal slip boundary conditions. Closed-form solutions to the non-dimensional boundary value problem are obtained under physiological limitations of low Reynolds number and large wavelength. The influence of key hydrodynamic and thermo-physical parameters i.e. Hartmann (magnetic) number, Casson (viscoplastic) fluid parameter, thermal slip parameter and velocity slip parameter on flow characteristics are investigated. A comparative study is also made with Newtonian fluids (corresponding to massive values of plastic viscosity). Stream lines are plotted to visualize trapping phenomenon. The computations reveal that velocity increases with increasing the magnitude of Hartmann number near the channel walls whereas in the core flow region (center of the channel) significant deceleration is observed. Temperature is elevated with greater Casson parameter, Hartmann number, velocity slip, eccentricity parameter, thermal slip and also Brinkmann (dissipation) number.

The Reynolds exponential viscosity model is deployed. Electrically-conducting nanofluids are considered which comprise a suspension of uniform dimension nanoparticles suspended in viscous base fluid. The nanofluid sheet is extended with a linear velocity in the axial direction. The Buonjiornio model is utilized which features Brownian motion and thermophoresis effects. The partial differential equations for mass, momentum, energy and species (nano-particle concentration) are formulated with magnetic body force term. Viscous and Joule dissipation effects are neglected. The emerging nonlinear, coupled, boundary value problem is solved numerically using the Rungeâ€“Kutta fourth order method along with a shooting technique. Graphical solutions for velocity, temperature, concentration field, skin friction and Nusselt number are presented. Furthermore stream function plots are also included. Validation with Nakamura\'s finite difference algorithm is included. Increasing nanofluid viscosity is observed to enhance temperatures and concentrations but to reduce velocity magnitudes. Nusselt number is enhanced with both thermal and species Grashof numbers whereas it is reduced with increasing thermophoresis parameter and Schmidt number. The model is applicable in nano-material manufacturing processes involving extruding sheets.

However, multimedia applications also require provisioning of adequate quality of service (QoS) to enhance quality of experience (QoE) of end users. In order to provide QoS in a network, the accurate knowledge of the remaining network resources at any time is the key. But, due to the inherent characteristics of MANETs such as dynamic topology, high bit-error-rate communication channels, and decentralized control, estimating remaining network resources is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel remaining bandwidth estimation algorithm which considers the node (or link) mobility into consideration while performing dynamic bandwidth estimation on a node. The estimated link bandwidth value is then used during the route discovery process to select routes with adequate bandwidth and thus increases the QoS of the data flow. The proposed algorithm is verified using real-time video traffic (i.e., H.264/SVC encoded video traces) using a industry standard simulator called Qualnet. The simulation results show that the proposed approach increases the decision accuracy of the soft admission control process and thus leads to the enhancement of the quality of the received video traffic.

Post machining operations such as drilling, orthogonal cutting, turning are necessary for composite materials to meet the dimensional and functional requirements. Drilling is a major process in manufacturing of holes, required for assembling the components in industrial applications. Drilling of holes in composites leads to a drilling-induced damage called delamination. The researchers have tried to reduce the drilling-induced damage by minimizing the operating variables and tool design. However, the research on delamination analysis using finite element method (FEM) is limited. This paper provides a comprehensive literature review on machining of composites which mainly focuses on conventional methods like turning, milling, trimming and drilling and also on simulation methods including discrete element method and finite element method.

Asphyxiated mangrove soil, existing on the borderline of land and sea, has the highest potential to trap â€˜blue carbonâ€™; hence, plantation programs have been initiated around the tropical coasts to restore this unique habitat. This case study provides a costâ€“benefit and carbon sequestration analysis for planting of five mangrove species (Avicennia marina, Bruguiera sexangula, Ceriops tagal, Rhizophora mucronata and Xylocarpus moluccensis) by various methods in a 102.4-ha area at the Indian Sundarbans. It is estimated that as per the planting methods used in the current study and physio-chemical properties of the sediment, coupled with other local factors such as anthropogenic interventions, Avicennia marina planting by the â€˜propagule dibblingâ€™ method is the most cost effective (0.002 Euro/survived plant), with the highest increment (97%) in organic carbon density (OCD), humic acid (100.86%) and fulvic acid (48.78%) over a period of 5 years. Survival rate was highest (82%) for Avicennia marina, planted by the â€˜transplanting of nursery-grown seedlingsâ€™ method. The drain and trench method resulted in a 55% survival rate for Rhizophora mucronata, but the extra labor investment made this the costliest method (0.13 Euro/survived plant) and also less carbon effective (only 85% increment of OCD in 5 years). Planting methods, sediment quality, tidal inundation and salinity variations can play a major role in blue carbon burial/sequestration in mangrove lands.

We report a simple, sensitive and specific nano-technology based `Nano-immuno test\' capable of detecting viable MAP bacilli in the milk samples within 10 h. Viable MAP bacilli were captured by MAP specific antibody-conjugated magnetic nano-particles using resazurin dye as chromogen. Test was optimized using true culture positive (10-bovine and 12-goats) and true culture negative (16-bovine and 25-goats) raw milk samples. Domestic livestock species in India are endemically infected with MAP. After successful optimization, sensitivity and specificity of the `nano-immuno test\' in goats with respect to milk culture was 91.7\\% and 96.0\\%, respectively. Whereas, it was 90.0\\% (sensitivity) and 92.6\\% (specificity) with respect to IS900 PCR. In bovine milk samples, sensitivity and specificity of `nano-immuno test\' with respect to milk culture was 90.0\\% and 93.7\\%, respectively. However, with respect to IS900 PCR, the sensitivity and specificity was 88.9\\% and 94.1\\%, respectively. Test was validated with field raw milk samples (goats-258 and bovine-138) collected from domestic livestock species to detect live/viable MAP bacilli. Of 138 bovine raw milk samples screened by six diagnostic tests, 81 (58.7\\%) milk samples were positive for MAP infection in one or more than one diagnostic tests. Of 81 (58.7\\%) positive bovine raw milk samples, only 24 (17.4\\%) samples were detected positive for the presence of viable MAP bacilli. Of 258 goats raw milk samples screened by six diagnostic tests, 141 (54.6\\%) were positive for MAP infection in one or more than one test. Of 141 (54.6\\%) positive raw milk samples from goats, only 48 (34.0\\%) were detected positive for live MAP bacilli. Simplicity and efficiency of this novel `nano-immuno test\' makes it suitable for wide-scale screening of milk samples in the field. Standardization, validation and re-usability of functionalized nano-particles and the test was successfully achieved in field samples.

Recent research efforts have shown that dynamic and cyclic loading may effectively prevent or reverse bone resorption as loading enhances osteogenesis. Loading-induced canalicular fluid flow in bone is considered as a potential stimulus of new bone formation. It is believed that poroelastic material properties such as porosity and permeability typically decide fluid flow in canalicular spaces of bone. Accordingly, the authors hypothesized that changes in poroelastic material properties with age may affect the fluid flow, which in turn affects the new bone response against any external mechanical stimulation. This work attempts to relate the age-related changes in poroelastic material properties to fluid-flow distribution in lacuna-canalicular spaces of bone. The outcomes may be useful in the development of effective strategies to enhance the canalicular fluid flow, so that optimal exercises or sports activities can be designed to prevent or reverse the age-related bone loss.

In the last two decades, there has been a plenteous study in energy harnessing. Now a day, energy harnessing using piezoelectric materials has drawn attention of researchers due to low cost, flexibility and light weight. The benefits of piezoelectric material can be utilized by designing a self-powered device for artificial nanoswimmer. Some of the ceramics which displays the piezoelectric effect are lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT), lead-titanate (PbTiO2), lead-zirconate (PbZrO3) and Barium Titanate (BaTiO3). PZT is most extensively used piezoelectric material in the field of energy harnessing but it is brittle in nature. Lead based piezoelectric materials are toxic in nature and may not suitable for in-vivo biomedical applications. To eradicate this problem, researchers are interested in synthesizing lead free piezoelectric material such as Aluminium Nitride (AIN), Barium Titanate (BaTiO3) and Polyvinylidenefluoride (PVDF). The biocompatibility of PVDF makes it appropriate to be used for energy harnessing in human body for applications like on board powering of nanoswimmer for various disease detection and drug delivery. In this paper, a cantilever beam is being simulated in COMSOL to study electric potential generated on the surface of beam made of different piezoelectric materials such as AIN, PVDF and PZT due to fluidic pressure, which will be utilized as energy for actuation of artificial nanoswimmer. Piezo-based cantilever beams have been compared and maximum electric potential is being observed in PVDF based beam. PVDF seems most promising piezoelectric material for in-vivo biomedical application and it is readily available.

This will protract the lifetime of sensor networks. However, a cluster head has to perform various tasks such as collection of data from member nodes, aggregation of the collected data, and send that data to the BS. Network load balance is a challenging issue in WSNs for the clustering schemes. Genetic algorithms (GA) with clustering schemes are implemented for better cluster formation. The GA run through again over a large no of iterations to find the optimal solution that leads to premature convergence. The chaotic GA (CGA) will solve this problem by avoiding local convergence, i.e., by choosing a chaotic map to generate the random values instead of traditional random function and improves the performance of the traditional GA.

Supervised learning methods for intrusion detection are not so effective in detection of attacks of big data. Unsupervised models are mainly used for the detection of events or attributes that occur together. A new parallel K-medoid clustering method and k-nearest neighbor classification techniques are proposed for intrusion detection for huge amount of data.

Much literature has concluded that the use of carbon electrodes provides more cost effective and more durable DEP devices than metal electrodes. More efficient devices not only need to be constructed from a low cost material but also from an inexpensive fabrication technique. In this study, we used yeast cells as model cells to perform a comparative study on trapping efficiency of carbon and gold electrode DEP devices. We have proposed, the sealing of carbon DEP device with glass, instead of PDMS, using adhesive bonding technique which not only reduce the leakage problem but also increases the device performance.

Study of density profiles, form factor, single particle levels and depletion fraction (DF) across the periodic chart reveals that the central depletion is correlated to shell structure and occurs due to unoccupancy in s-orbit (2s, 3s, 4s) and inversion of (2s, 1d) and (3s, 1h) states in nuclei upto Z â‰¤ 82.

An analytical prediction model for determining the standard deviation of the final surface is developed in terms of the aforesaid scanning parameters using response surface methodology (RSM). Furthermore, the optimal scanning parameters are predicted after comparing two almost unexplored nature inspired algorithms i.e. Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) and Moth-Flame Optimization (MFO).

Poisson-Boltzmann equation is also simplified by using Debye-Huckel linearization. No slip conditions are imposed at the channel walls. The analytical solutions are obtained for temperature field and nanoparticle volume fraction. However, a perturbation method is used to find out an approximate solution for axial velocity, pressure rise and volumetric flow rate. The perturbation solutions are further graphically illustrated with MATLAB software. The perturbation solution is also validated with numerical results simulated by MATLAB coding through BVP command. The effects of thermal radiation and non-Newtonian parameters on flow characteristics, pumping characteristics, wall shear stress and trapping phenomenon are discussed. A comparative study is also made to study the electroosmotic flow through uniform and nonuniform asymmetric microfluidic channel.

In this paper, we propose a reactive Link Stability Based Routing (LSBR) protocol. LSBR discover route consisting of links having high lifetime. The stability of a link is estimated dynamically during the route dis covery process using its signal strength and interference along with the relative mobility of nodes forming the link. A multi-metric mathematical model has been developed using the aforementioned parameters to select a link from the candidate links at each intermediate node in such a way that leads to selection of high lifetime route. To prove effectiveness of LSBR protocol for real-life video streaming, a hybrid MANET scenario consisted of simulated nodes and physical machines is designed using an industry standard emulation tool called EXata-Cyber.

First area is equipped with a single reheat thermal unit and a superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) unit, while another area has a hydro-unit with SMES. A multi-stage optimization strategy for the optimal solution of FLC for tie-line and frequency oscillation suppression is proposed in this paper using an ant colony optimization technique. The optimization of FLC is carried out in four different stages. The first stage is the optimization of range of input and output variables; the second stage is the optimization of membership function; the third and fourth stages are the optimization for rule base and rule weight optimization, respectively. The performance of the proposed controller is also compared with another control approaches to stabilize Ptie-line and Î”f oscillations; these are the Zieglerâ€“Nichols-tuned proportionalâ€“integralâ€“derivative (PID) controller and genetic algorithm optimized PID controller.

Joule electro-thermal heating is included. The dimensional conservation equations are linearized and transformed from the wave to the fixed (laboratory) frame under lubrication theory approximations. The emerging dimensionless model features a number of important thermo-physical, electrical and nanoscale parameter, namely thermal and solutal (basic density) Grashof numbers, nanoscale Brownian motion parameter, thermophoresis parameter, Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity (maximum electro-osmotic velocity), Debye electrokinetic length and Joule heating to surface heat flux ratio. Closed-form solutions are derived for the nano-particle volume fraction, temperature, axial velocity, averaged volumetric flow rate, pressure difference across one wavelength, skin friction (wall shear stress function), Nusselt number (wall heat transfer rate) and stream function distribution in the wave frame. The influence of selected parameters on these flow variables is studied with the aid of graphs.

Viable MAP bacilli were captured by MAP specific antibody-conjugated magnetic nano-particles using resazurin dye as chromogen. Test was optimized using true culture positive (10-bovine and 12-goats) and true culture negative (16-bovine and 25-goats) raw milk samples.

Of 138 bovine raw milk samples screened by six diagnostic tests, 81 (58.7%) milk samples were positive for MAP infection in one or more than one diagnostic tests. Of 81 (58.7%) positive bovine raw milk samples, only 24 (17.4%) samples were detected positive for the presence of viable MAP bacilli. Of 258 goats raw milk samples screened by six diagnostic tests, 141 (54.6%) were positive for MAP infection in one or more than one test. Of 141 (54.6%) positive raw milk samples from goats, only 48 (34.0%) were detected positive for live MAP bacilli. Simplicity and efficiency of this novel â€˜nano-immuno testâ€™ makes it suitable for wide-scale screening of milk samples in the field. Standardization, validation and re-usability of functionalized nano-particles and the test was successfully achieved in field samples.

Raghuram, G., Indian Inst Management Ahmedabad, Ahmadabad, Gujarat, India.', 'Structuring public private partnerships (PPP) in railways is a challenge, given its technology base, and obligation as a public and affordable mode of transportation. The sector provides strong incentives for vertical integration due to economies of scope. However, it is evident from the literature that large integrated PPPs in railway systems are not feasible due to higher commercial risks. They also suffer from implicit cross subsidization since the railway infrastructure is capital intensive, common to multiple revenue sources, and fare box revenues are generally not sufficient to recover investments. This is being addressed by various unbundling approaches in recent PPPs. The common unbundling is between infrastructure, operations, and services. The objective of this research is to explore the potential of unbundling further and to come up with a framework that helps policy makers in taking macro level decisions on PPP structuring. The research disaggregates the railway system into over 40 `elements\' wherein an element is the smallest unit that can be given to a party for execution. However this unbundling would result in significant horizontal and vertical interfaces between these elements. A sustainable PPP would need to limit the extent of interfaces due to transaction costs and risks. This can be achieved by bundling the elements horizontally and/or vertically into `entities\' to extract the best value for a PPP. The governing principles would be scale economies (horizontal integration), scope economies (vertical integration), need for competition (horizontal disaggregation), level playing field, transactional transparency, and need for specialization (vertical disaggregation). Additional drivers would be appetite for investment, availability of competence and accountability for an entity. The findings of the research indicate that the entity formation is one of the most crucial aspects of a PPP in railways. A consequential critical area is managing the interfaces between entities, which are subject to transaction costs and risks. These should be carefully identified and addressed by well-designed contractual agreements and independent regulation. (C) 2014 World Conference on Transport Research Society.

Bioremediation one of the important process of the above, degrades or transforms hazardous contaminants to less toxic compounds. Several groups of fungi have proved highly efficient in this aspect, with asbestos being one such toxic entity in the environment on which their activity was studied. The present investigation uses the same tool as a device for detoxifying asbestos, a potent carcinogenic entity; with fungal isolates native to the asbestos mines of Rajasthan, India, being investigated for the first time. The cellular mechanism of asbestos toxicity is mainly attributed to the presence of iron in its chemical composition which catalyzes generation of free radicals leading to oxidation of biomolecules. The two dominant novel species found therein, identified as Aspergillus tubingenesis and Coemansia reversa have proved capable of actively removing iron from asbestos fibers as studied by scanning electron microscopy- electron diffraction X-ray (SEM-EDX) analysis. This probably could lead to a reduction in toxicity of asbestos, due to reduced iron concentration as reported in related studies. Many fungi are known to release iron chelating compounds, siderophores, which could be instrumental in the study. The findings related to two new fungal species being added to the list of earlier identified fungal bioremediators of asbestos, widens the prospect of using bioremediation as an effective tool for asbestos detoxification.

In general; a robust steganography scheme should have better visual imperceptibility of the hidden information with sufficient payload. In this paper, a steganography method based on cryptography is proposed. The proposed scheme uses two processes; first, encrypt the secret plaintext (PT) message followed by secret image generation from this encrypted message. Second, hide this secret image into the cover image using Daubechies discrete wavelet transform operation followed by mixing operation. After performing the Daubechies inverse discrete wavelet transform (IDWT) process, we get the stego image. Stego image visual quality is increased by using Daubechies wavelet.

Available inorganic and organic chemicals used in commercial sunscreen have deleterious activity in vivo. Therefore, there is a need of a safe and natural sunscreen. Cyanobacteria are the impressive source of natural products and they can be exploited industrially. Cyanobacteria synthesize the UV absorbing compounds like mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) and scytonemin. MAAs are water-soluble molecules (188 to 1050 Da) that absorb UV-A and UV-B radiation and disperse the energy as heat. Scytonemin is a lipid soluble pigment (544 Da) having absorption maxima at 380 nm. They are promising natural alternatives for both direct (UV-absorption) and indirect (antioxidant) protection. These molecules show strong photostability and do not have any cytotoxic effects. The search for natural UV protective molecules is relatively recent, providing two commercial products (Helioguard(r) and Helionori(r)) containing MAAs extract from red alga Porphyra umbilicalis. Still commercialization of potential photoprotective molecules is required for the development of a better and safe sunscreen. Therefore, for improvement in their expression levels, a complete understanding of biosynthetic pathway of MAAs and scytonemin is essential. Additionally, an economic and sustainable method for extraction of these molecules from cyanobacteria is also required for large-scale production. Future perspectives include the heterologous expression of MAAs and/or scytonemin in industrially friendly microorganisms in order to co-produce different UV protective molecules and thus cover a broader UV spectrum and simplify the production process.

In silico models assumed normal strain as the stimulus to predict the sites of new bone formation. These models, however, may fail to fit the amount of newly formed bone. Loading parameters such as strain, frequency, and loading cycle decide the amount of new bone formation. The models did not incorporate this information. In fact, there is no unifying relationship to quantify the amount of new bone formation as a function of loading parameters. Therefore, the present work aims to establish an empirical relationship between loading parameters and a new bone formation parameter i.e. mineral apposition rate (MAR). A neural network model is used to serve the purpose. Loading parameters are supplied as input, whereas, MAR served as output. The model is trained and tested with experimental data. The model establishes an empirical relationship to estimate MAR as a function of loading parameters. The model\'s predictions of MAR align with in vivo experimental results. The model\'s response is analyzed which indicates that the bone adaptation characteristics are successfully captured in the relationship. The relationship established may be incorporated further to improve qualitative and quantitative prediction capabilities of computer models.

Minutiae based representation has some disadvantages in comparison to other fingerprint approached in terms of sample size. This paper describes a novel concept of partition based approach for fingerprint identification which aims to improve error rates as well as processing time in matching fingerprints. We aim to split the identity image into well separated partitions in order to simplify the identification task. Our system will use the gray-scale information of the fingerprints. The system will select the primary fingerprint, perform feature extraction & feature matching to identify the image in the database by comparing the featured values of both the fingerprints. Our implementation mainly incorporates image pre-processing, image partitioning, image binarization, feature extraction and feature matching. It finally generates a score which tells whether two fingerprints match or not.

Here we will take account of GraphLab, Apache MahoutTM, and Jubatus to get the exposure of famous academics and industrial results.

In the Young scheme (2013), a secret image is subdivided into n non-overlapped image sections. When L (2 â‰¤ L â‰¤ n) participants stack their shadow images, all the image sections associated with these L participants will be recovered. In this article, the scheme suggested for a block based progressive scheme is critically analyzed and we show that leakage of secret information is possible in the scheme during the encoding process of the shares. Further, we propose a new robust progressive algorithm based on the logistic chaotic map to overcome the said limitation. The irregular outputs of the logistic map are used to encode a secret digital image. To provide robustness during the encoding process of the share, noise has been introduced along with chaotic sequences. The performance of the algorithm in the scheme of Young is critically analyzed and compared with the new suggested scheme.

In this paper, we propose a novel Mobility Aware Cross-layer Routing approach for Peer-to-Peer Networks (MACARON) over MANET. MACARON provides reliable communication and high lifetime routes to support efficient data transmission in the network. For this purpose, it uses cross-layer communications to share routing updates between MANET and overlay routing protocols. MACARON provides guaranteed routes with low path stretch by maintaining OËœ(n) routing entries per node, where n is the number of nodes in the network. It provides scalability without using any landmark directory to store routing state, and it can effectively handle moderate mobility by using Last Encounter Routing (LER) protocol.

Furthermore, Au alloys constitute an important model system in the context of corrosion, dealloying, and stress corrosion cracking. Adsorbed self-assembled monolayers of thiol molecules inhibit the dealloying reaction. On thiol-modified Cu-Au alloys dealloying finally proceeds in a localized reaction instead of a homogeneous process. Using ethanethiols as an example, we show here that thiols can be effectively removed by application of anodic oxidation. Homogeneous porosity forms then after an oxidation step. In-situ X-ray diffraction and crystal truncation rod analysis of ethanethiol-modified Au (001) confirms that a bare Au surface is recovered after a similar oxidation step. In consequence, a multi-step dealloying process including complete initial thiol-layers as well as partially or fully re-cleaned surfaces can produce different micro-cracks, providing larger scale openings, and homogeneous nanoporous Au in between. Such hierarchically structured surfaces may show superior applicability for reactions where mass transport into the porous layer plays a decisive role for the reaction rate or detection probability.

Recently, several molecular genetic studies have provided multiple lines of evidence for a critical role of genetic factors in the expression of human bladder exstrophy-epispadias complex (BEEC). At this point, ISL1 (ISL LIM homeobox 1) has emerged as the major susceptibility gene for classic bladder exstrophy (CBE), in a multifactorial disease model. Here, GWAS (Genome wide association studies) discovery and replication studies, as well as the re-sequencing of ISL1, identified sequence variants (rs9291768, rs6874700, c.137C > G (p.Ala46Gly)) associated with CBE. Here, we aimed to determine the molecular and functional consequences of these sequence variants and estimate the dependence of ISL1 protein on other predicted candidates. We used: (i) computational analysis of conserved sequence motifs to perform an evolutionary conservation analysis, based on a Bayesian algorithm, and (ii) computational 3D structural modeling. Furthermore, we looked into long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) residing within the ISL1 region, aiming to predict their targets. Our analysis suggests that the ISL1 protein specific N-terminal LIM domain (which harbors the variant c.137C>G), limits its transcriptional ability, and might interfere with ISL1-estrogen receptor Î± interactions. In conclusion, our analysis provides further useful insights about the ISL1 gene, which is involved in the formation of the BEEC, and in the development of the urinary bladder.

We review the existing vulnerabilities in Bitcoin and its major underlying technologies such as blockchain and PoW-based consensus protocol. These vulnerabilities lead to the execution of various security threats to the standard functionality of Bitcoin. We then investigate the feasibility and robustness of the state-of-the-art security solutions.

A handoff occurs when the Received Signal Strength (RSS) is less than the threshold RSS and the new RSS (from neighbors Access point) is more than the present RSS. Earlier the handoff decision algorithms consider RSS only which results in an increase in handoff counting or handoff rate but in a wireless communication system, the signal strength varies due to scattering, shadowing and reflection because of obstacles in the network region. This variation in RSS leads to unnecessary handoff. In this paper, a new method for handoff decision is proposed to reduce the unnecessary handoff. With simulation results or mathematical analysis 25% unnecessary handoff reduced.

But selfish users be likely to act greedily to access the channel without involving in spectrum sensing. In this paper, we considered multiuser de-centralized cooperative spectrum sensing scenario and game theory is used to analyze the cognitive interaction process.

Deeper elucidation of the fluid dynamics of such transport requires the continuous need for more elegant mathematical models and numerical simulations, in parallel with laboratory investigations. In this article we therefore investigate analytically the unsteady viscous flow driven by the combined effects of peristalsis and electro-osmosis through microchannel. An integral number of waves propagating in the microchannel are considered as a model for transportation of fluid bolus along the channel length. Debye-Hiickel linearization is employed to evaluate the potential function. Low Reynolds number and large wavelength approximations are employed. Closed-form solutions are derived for the non-dimensional boundary value problem. The computations demonstrate that magnitude of electric potential function is increased with a decrease in the thickness of the electrical double layer (EDL). Stronger electric field also decelerates the flow and decreases local wall shear stress. Hydrodynamic pressure is increased with EDL thickness whereas it is suppressed with electric field. Streamline visualization reveals that the quantity of trapped bolus is decreased with increase in EDL thickness and also with higher external electric field.

This is when mobile agents are used for data aggregation to exploit redundant and correlated data. The efficiency of agent-based data aggregation depends on the agent migration scheme. However, in general, most of the proposed schemes are centralized approach-based schemes where the sink node determines the migration paths for the agents before dispatching them in the sensor network. The main limitations with such schemes are that they need global network topology information for deriving the migration paths of the agents, which incurs additional communication overhead, since each node has a very limited communication range. In addition, a centralized approach does not provide fault tolerant and adaptive migration paths. In order to solve such problems, we have proposed a distributed approach-based scheme for determining the migration path of the agents where at each hop, the local information is used to decide the migration of the agents. In addition, we also propose a local repair mechanism for dealing with the faulty nodes. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme performs better than existing schemes in the presence of faulty nodes within the networks, and manages to report the aggregated data to the sink faster.

It is a well-known fact that in most of the real world applications related to WSNs, the deployment is random as manual deployment is not possible due to harsh environments and other complexities. Therefore, there is no prior knowledge about the position of the sensor nodes that are deployed to form a wireless sensor network. In order to overcome this aspect related to position estimate of sensor nodes various localization schemes and algorithms have been proposed. The schemes and algorithms proposed so far also offer advantages like optimal routing, energy conservation, security, topology control besides providing the accurate position estimation of deployed sensor nodes. This paper explicitly presents a survey on the existing learning and non-learning based algorithms that have special role in localization of sensor nodes for WSNs. Methods: Comparative analysis of prominent learning and non-learning based algorithms. The analysis is based in terms of physical measurement, accuracy, computation and hardware cost and energy efficiency. Result: Detailed reporting of learning and non-learning based algorithms with their sub-categories. The study and survey of various algorithms throw light on their applicability and use for WSNs.

Further, the non-dimensional shearing stress and the rate of heat transfer in terms of the Nusselt number at the walls of channel are also obtained.

Findings - The influence of emerging physical flow parameters on fluid velocity component, temperature distribution and nanoparticle concentration are discussed in detail. Also, anOHAM solution demonstrates very good correlation with those obtained in the previously published results. It is noticed that OHAM can overcome the earlier restriction, assumptions and limitation of traditional perturbation method. The main advantage of this method is that OHAM can be applied directly to nonlinear differential equations without using linearization and round-off errors, and therefore, it cannot be affected by error associated to discretization.

Joule electro-thermal heating is included. The dimensional conservation equations are linearized and transformed from the wave to the fixed (laboratory) frame under lubrication theory approximations. The emerging dimensionless model features a number of important thermo-physical, electrical and nanoscale parameter, namely thermal and solutal (basic density) Grashof numbers, nanoscale Brownian motion parameter, thermophoresis parameter, Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity (maximum electro-osmotic velocity), Debye electrokinetic length and Joule heating to surface heat flux ratio. Closed-form solutions are derived for the nano-particle volume fraction, temperature, axial velocity, averaged volumetric flow rate, pressure difference across one wavelength, skin friction (wall shear stress function), Nusselt number (wall heat transfer rate) and stream function distribution in the wave frame. The influence of selected parameters on these flow variables is studied with the aid of graphs.

Peristalsis is one of the most efficient of these mechanisms and offers considerable promise in microscale fluidics. Electrokinetic peristalsis has recently also stimulated significant attention. Electrical and magnetic fields also offer an excellent mode for regulating flows. Motivated by novel applications in electro-conductive microchannel transport systems, the current article investigates analytically the electromagnetic pumping of non-Newtonian aqueous electrolytes via peristaltic waves in a two-dimensional microchannel with different peristaltic waves propagating at the upper and lower channel wall (complex wavy scenario). The Stokes couple stress model is deployed to capture micro-structural characteristics of real working fluids. The unsteady two-dimensional conservation equations for mass and momentum conservation, electro-kinetic and magnetic body forces, are formulated in two dimensional Cartesian co-ordinates. The transport equations are transformed from the wave frame to the laboratory frame and the electrical field terms rendered into electrical potential terms via the Poisson-Boltzmann equation, Debye length approximation and ionic Nernst Planck equation. The dimensionless emerging linearized electro-magnetic boundary value problem is solved using integral methods. The influence of Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity (characteristic electro-osmotic velocity), couple stress length parameter (measure of the polarity of the fluid), Hartmann magnetic number, and electro-osmotic parameter on axial velocity, volumetric flow rate, time-averaged flow rate and streamline distribution are visualized and interpreted at length.

From the research conducted so far it is understood that life time resource of LEDs is mainly dependent on junction temperature. For most of the high power LEDs, which are enclosed inside a luminaire, dissipation of junction heat from the device is a major concern for most of the manufacturers. In this paper, an attempt has been made to investigate the underlying constraints of heat dissipation and subsequently using LEDs as a general light source. The investigation is carried out in two steps. Firstly, the degradation in light output with corresponding increase in ambient temperature is explored. Secondly, the impact of increase in T-point temperature on the lifetime of the LEDs is observed. The experiment is conducted using high power LEDs and the same is subjected to external thermal stress. The temperature inside the environmental chamber represents the ambient temperature for the LED and thus by gradually increasing the ambient temperature the T-point temperature is also increased. The temperature of the chamber and the T-point are measured by using k-type thermocouple. The corresponding data hence obtained are tabulated and correlated with light output. The results are analysed using statistical tool to obtain the relation between the parameters. Â© 2016, LLC Editorial of Journal â€œLight Technikâ€.

An integrated approach has been used to incorporate ultrafine fluorcanasite (FC) glass-ceramic particulates within nanocellulose matrix, synthesized from lignocellulosic biomass. Epichlorohydrin (ECH) was used as a chemical cross-linking agent for hydrogel synthesis. The compositions and properties of bio-nanocomposite hydrogels were controlled by varying the loading of FC and ECH. Moreover, microstructural characterizations and functional group analysis of synthesized nanocellulose and bio-nanocomposite hydrogels were carried out using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). SEM studies revealed successful extraction of cellulosic nanofibres and interconnected porous micro-architecture of injectable hydrogels. Incorporation of FC particulates resulted into development of well-defined micro-porous morphology. FT-IR studies indicated the presence of hydroxyl groups and possible interactions between nanocellulose and FC reinforcements. The rheological study of the developed injectable hydrogel was carried out at different frequency, amplitude and temperature sweeps. The studies revealed that after the incorporation of FC, dynamic storage modulus increased, while synergistically enhancing the injectability of the bio-nanocomposite hydrogels. An optimum loading level of FC reinforcement could also be established. Swelling behaviour studies of the hydrogels demonstrated higher degree of swelling and enhanced structural integrity with incorporation of FC.

Recently the power factor improvement tool is made compulsive for CFL and the recommended range as suggested by IEC 61000-3-2 is greater than 0.85. In addition to this the current harmonic distortion is preferred to be around 30% as per the standards. But unfortunately there are still CFLs available in the market which have less power factor in comparison with the desired standards. This has caused substantial problems not only on the generation side, but it certainly has considerable impact on the lamp performance. In the present work in order to exemplify this problem, four CFLs of 15W each from two different manufacturers are used for the experiment. Out of these four lamps, two lamps are ballast with low input power factor and instant start type. The other two are incorporated with improved input power factor having rapid start or warm start circuitry. The lamps are constantly switched ON and OFF at regular intervals. The interval was taken as 5 minutes ON and 5 minutes OFF. The lamps were subjected to this accelerated switching test. At the end of every switching cycle the electrode temperature was calculated from the ratio of hot resistance to cold resistance. It was thus observed that lamps with instant start ballast and poor power factor were unable to sustain the switching stress as compared to the lamps with rapid start ballast and improved power factor. Furthermore, the rise in electrode temperature for the lamps with improved power factor was within the desired standards. Thus it was concluded that lamps with poor power factor was more prone to early end in comparison with the other variety.

Most of the work reported on analog chaotic communication is based on the pioneer work of Pecora and Caroll, with synchronization between transmitter and receiver. Receiver based on synchronization, also known as coherent receiver, has a disadvantage of parameter mismatch and is sensitive to noise. In the present work, firstly, a secure transmitter using chaotic DC-DC converters is proposed that encrypts information using chaotic switching map technique. In chaotic switching map technique, the message is encrypted by randomly switching from one chaotic converter to another. The bifurcation parameter of the randomly switched chaotic converter is modulated by the message. Secondly, an attempt has been made to design a robust non-coherent receiver that is adaptable to the switching chaotic transmitters, even in the presence of noise. Once the receiver identifies the chaotic converter, it can decode the message as per the decryption algorithm. With the proposed non-coherent receiver, the disadvantages of coherent receivers can be overcome. We have also devised a prototype smart meter, used in smart distribution grid for implementing the proposed communication technique. Copyright Â© 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The paper mainly focusses on these techniques at a single site and the enhancements made to the already existing techniques throughout the use of GPU architecture using CUDA platform in lieu of enhancing the performance of already existing solution with respect to time and algorithmic complexity. The paper also explains the need of enhancing prevailing solutions for load flow analysis for future generation smart grids or real time systems by comparing the performance with serial version for different topologies of network. Further the paper also throws light on some of the network reconfiguration techniques used to remodel the RDN due to high power losses in the network and floats an idea how parallel processing can be beneficial in enhancing already existing genetic algorithm based network reconfiguration technique to support real time load flow calculations and topology construction in smart grids and future generation systems.

Design/methodology/approach: A case study approach was employed followed by interpretive structural modelling (ISM) to model the interrelationship among the LIBs. Findings: This study reveals that lack of management commitment, leadership and resources are the key barriers to lean implementation in SMEs in India. Furthermore, poor communication between different levels of the organisation and inadequate dissemination of the knowledge of lean benefits also creates hindrance in lean implementation.

A WSN consist of thousands of nodes that make the installation of GPS on each sensor node expensive and moreover GPS will not provide exact localization results in an indoor environment. Manually configuring location reference on each sensor node is also not possible in the case of dense network. This gives rise to a problem where the sensor nodes must identify its current location without using any special hardware like GPS and without the help of manual configuration. Localization techniques makes the deployment of WSNs economical. Most of the localization techniques are carried out with the help of anchor node or beacon node, which knows its present location. Based on the location information provided by the anchor node or beacon node, other nodes localize themselves.

A good VMs migration system has an impact on energy efficiency policy. Good resource administration policy monitors the on-demand load management, and also manages the allocation/relocation of the VMs. The key challenges are VMs isolation and migration in heterogeneous physical servers. Threshold mechanism is effective to manage the load among VMs. Previous research shows thrashing is a good option to manage load and migrate the load among VMs during failover and high load. Linear programming (LP), static and dynamic approaches are superior to manage the load through VMs migration.

If we analyze the financial inclusion, we will found that achieving the financial inclusion is based on two pillars - demand side and supply side. Where availability of the financial products in the market is very important, equally important is the fact that people are aware of them and they are in a situation to demand those products. In this context, financial literacy among the masses is very important, so that people have the awareness about the financial climate and financial products. This will increase their capability to demand for the financial products. This way, it can achieve the target of financial inclusion. Research Methodology: The research work is based on the secondary data. These data are obtained fromRBI publications, research papers and text books. It also uses secondary data from various other sources- newspapers, journals and periodicals like Economic Times, Business Line, Micro-Finance world etc. The study is designed as follows: In section-1 we introduce the concept of financial inclusion. An attempt is made to understand meaning, role and importance of financial inclusion. Section-2 will describe the link between financial inclusion and financial literacy and the various facets of it. In section-3 we provide our conclusions and some suggestions. Findings: Financial inclusion is an attempt to achieve the ultimate objective i.e. inclusive growth. Financial inclusion is an important constituent of this, because a financially deprivement is a very big deterrent of a person\'s overall development. Our study reveals that the final answer of financial inclusion rests on both sides-demand side and supply side. It is now, becoming increasingly apparent that addressing the problem of financial exclusion will require a holistic approach in creating awareness about not only on credit management but on financial products, education, debt counseling, savings and advice on money management.

Some suitable similarity transformations reduced the governing boundary layer non-linear partial differential equations into a set of ordinary non-linear differential equations. The transformed equations are then solved numerically using fourth order Runga-Kutta method along with Shooting technique. The major outcomes of the present study is that the magnetic field impedes the fluid motion while thermal as well as mass buoyancy forces accelerate it, the thermophoretic diffusion enhances dimensionless fluid temperature as well as concentration leading to thicker thermal and concentration boundary layers. On the other hand, concentration exponent, Brownian motion parameter and chemical reaction parameter exhibit reverse trend on temperature and concentration. In addition, the presence of magnetic field under the influence of thermal as well as mass buoyancies supports to reduce the rate of heat transfer as well as wall shear stress while the first order chemical reaction develops a thinner concentration boundary layer.

We analyze the spatial distribution of pressure and wall shear stress for a continuous wave train and single pulse peristaltic wave in the presence of an electrical (electroosmotic) body force, which acts on the net charges in the electrical double layer.

Cyanobacteria might have faced the most deleterious ultraviolet radiation, which leads to an evolution of ultraviolet protecting mycosporine-like amino acids for efficient selection in the environment. In the last 30 years, scientists have investigated various cyanobacteria for novel mycosporine-like amino acids, applying different induction techniques. This review organizes all the cyanobacterial groups that produce various mycosporine-like amino acids. We found out that cyanobacteria belonging to orders Synechococcales, Chroococcales, Oscillatoriales, and Nostocales are frequently studied for the presence of mycosporine-like amino acids, while orders Gloeobacterales, Spirulinales, Pleurocapsales, and Chroococcidiopsidales are still need to be investigated.

FEA results showed that the outer layers have the most significant influence on the buckling strength of the composite laminated material.

Therefore, we present a systematic computational study on the spin polarized transport in surface oxidized GNR in antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin configuration using density functional theory combined with non-equilibrium Green\'s function (NEGF) method. It is found that the conductance in oxidized GNRs is significantly suppressed in the valance band and the conduction band. A further reduction in the conductance profile is seen in presence of two oxygen atoms on the ribbon plane. This change in the conductance may be attributed to change in the surface topology of the ribbon basal plane due to presence of the oxygen adatoms, where the charge transfer take place between the ribbon basal plane and the oxygen atoms.

Blood is assumed as non-Newtonian (micropolar) nanofluids. The flow regime is considered as asymmetric diverging (tapered) microchannel for more realistic micro-vessels which is produced by choosing the peristaltic wave train on the walls to have different amplitudes and phase. The Rosseland approximation is employed to model the radiation heat transfer and temperatures of the walls are presumed constants. The mathematical formulation of the present problem is simplified under the long-wavelength, low-Reynolds number and Debye-HÃ¼ckel linearization approximations. The influence of various dominant physical parameters are discussed for axial velocity, microrotation distribution, thermal temperature distribution and nanoparticle volume fraction field. However, our foremost emphasis is to determine the effects of thermal radiation and coupling number on the axial velocity and microrotation distribution beneath electroosmotic environment. This analysis places a significant observation on the thermal radiation and coupling number which plays an influential role in hearten fluid velocity. This study is encouraged by exploring the nanofluid-dynamics in peristaltic transport as symbolized by heat transport in biological flows and also in novel pharmacodynamics pumps and gastro-intestinal motility enhancement.

In most such cases, the conventional communication infrastructure such as wired and cellular networks get damaged and therefore cannot provide communication required to exchange emergency information. Therefore, to cope with such disasters in a fast and coordinated way, the optimal provisioning of the emergency information is crucial. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) are the paramount components for such situations. UAVs can act as mobile base stations and facilitate wireless communication to connect to nearest working telephone network access point. A large scale disaster information system can be formed by combining UAV network with existing available network regardless of some of network lines being damaged and destroyed. In this paper, we have designed a prototype of UAV assisted emergency ad hoc network (EANET). We have also evaluated and compared AODV and ZRP routing protocols by varying the number of UAV assisted EANET nodes in different transmission range cases of disaster scenarios. The experimental results illustrate that ZRP is the most appropriate protocol for emergency situations.

The three techniques used are: clamping of NMOS diode, clamping of PMOS diode, and clamping of NMOS and PMOS diode. Out of the three techniques, leakage current in 8T SRAM was minimum using PMOS clamping diode as compared to other proposed techniques. The supply voltage has been varied from 0.5 to 0.85 V.

Methods, results and conclusions: The problem is formulated in the form of nonlinear partial differential equations, which are simplified by using the dimensional analysis to avoid the complicacy of dimensional homogeneity. Lubrication theory is employed to linearize the governing equations and it is also physically appropriate for cilia movement. Analytical solutions for velocity, temperature and pressure gradient and stream function are obtained. The analytical results are numerically simulated by using the Mathematica Software and plotted the graphs for velocity profile, temperature profile, pressure gradient and stream lines for better discussion and visualization.

Out of the three types of complainants (consumer complaint intention), voice complaint intention appeared as the strongest determinant of consumer trust and retention as compared to private and third party complaint intention. On providing complaint handling, the strength of the relationship improved to the greatest extent for private complaint intention while there was no effect of complaint handling for voice complaint intention.

In this paper, we introduce a new ranking algorithm that computes the rank of a task, based on its successor rank and its predecessors average communication time, instead of its successors rank. The advantage of this ranking algorithm is that two dependent tasks are assigned to the same machine and as a result the scheduled length is reduced. The task selection phase selects a ready task from each workflow and creates a task pool. The resource selection phase initially assigns tasks using min-min heuristic, after initial assignment, tasks are moved from the highly loaded machines to the lightly loaded machines. Our resource selection algorithm increases the load balance among the resources due to tasks assignment heuristic and reassignment of tasks from the highly loaded machines. The simulation results show that our proposed scheduling algorithm performs better over existing approaches in terms of load balance, makespan and turnaround time. Â© 2018 Slovak Academy of Sciences.

In context of increased energy efficiency, energy storage and waste heat recovery play an important role as these systems improve overall efficiency of systems. In this study, a latent heat thermal energy storage system (LHTESS) for stationary C.I. engine exhaust heat was developed and integrated with engine. A shell and tube type heat exchanger having 346 mm diameter and 420 mm height with 45 numbers of tubes with 18 mm diameter was developed to store thermal energy, in which Erythritol (C4H10O4) was used as a phase change material. The engine performance and the thermal energy storage system performance parameters such as amount of heat stored, and charging efficiency were evaluated. Slight decrease in the engine performance was observed when latent heat thermal energy storage system was integrated to engine but amount of energy which could be recovered was significant.

The reason can be attributed mainly to the enhanced lifetime and less energy consumption as compared to the other mentioned types. However one important aspect needs attention, the impact of driver on LEDs. LEDs are current controlled devices and hence emit maximum light with increase in current input to the device. This feature, boost up the light output but it increases the junction temperature of the device. Hence additional heat sinks are required to vent out the excessive heat generated due to increase current input to the LEDs. Those additional heat sinks are at times difficult to accommodate. So, designers have made arrangements to vent out the heat from the device. This is achieved by designing fins. However this arrangement is not suitable in places where the ambient temperature is more than normal. Thus, design of LED driver with controlled current input is essential in order to maintain the thermal limit of the device. Secondly, the AC-DC LEDs driver circuits, which are available in the market, are seldom equipped with input power factor and THD improvement circuitry as prescribed in IEC61000- 3-2. This is essential for maintaining the energy efficiency of the nearest utility services and in addition also improves on the current drawn by the device. The following work envisages these issues and proposes corrective driver circuit based on two different driver topologies, buck-boost topology and flyback topology. Both these topologies are proposed in order to address the aspects of power quality and its impact on the life of the device.

It is observed that with an increment in the Grashof number the velocity of the governing fluids starts to decrease significantly and the pressure gradient is higher for pure water as compared to single-walled carbon nanotubes due to low density. As the specific heat is very high for pure water as compared to the multi-wall carbon nanotubes, it raises temperature of the muscles, in the case of pure water, as compared to the multi-walled carbon nanotubes.

The US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) had approved telavancin in 2009 for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSIs) caused by Gram-positive bacteria, including MRSA (S. aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus anginosus group, or Enterococcus faecalis). Telavancin has two proposed mechanisms of action. In vitro, telavancin has a rapid, concentration-dependent bactericidal effect, due to disruption of cell membrane integrity. Telavancin has demonstrable in vitro activity against aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria. Telavancin and vancomycin have similar spectra of activity. Gram-negative bacteria are usually non-susceptible to telavancin. Telavancin has been successfully tested in various animal models of bacteremia, endocarditis, meningitis, and pneumonia. Phase II Telavancin versus Standard Therapy for Treatment of Complicated Skin and Soft-Tissue Infections due to Gram-Positive Bacteria (FAST 1 and FAST 2) and phase III {[}Assessment of Telavancin in Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections 1 (ATLAS 1 and ATLAS 2)] clinical trials have been conducted for evaluating telavancin\'s efficacy and safety in cSSSIs. Phase III clinical trials have been carried out for evaluating telavancin\'s safety and efficacy in nosocomial pneumonia {[}Assessment of Telavancin for Treatment of Hospital acquired Pneumonia 1 and 2 (ATTAIN 1 and ATTAIN 2)]. A phase II randomized, double-blind, clinical trial has been carried out for evaluating telavancin\'s safety and efficacy in uncomplicated S. aureus bacteremia {[}Telavancin for Treatment of Uncomplicated S. aureus Bacteremia (ASSURE)]. Pacemaker lead-related infective endocarditis due to a vancomycin intermediate S. aureus (VISA) strain (non-daptomycin susceptible) was successfully treated with parenteral telavancin for 8 weeks. Telavancin extensively binds to serum albumin (similar to 93\\%) and has a relatively small volume of distribution. Telavancin is not biotransformed by any cytochrome P450 microsomal enzymes and excreted mainly in the urine. Though well-tolerated, worrisome adverse effects, including renal dysfunction and QTc prolongation are of potential concern. Given its extensive binding to plasma proteins, long half-life, and a long post-antibiotic effect, it represents a promising addition to the therapeutic armamentarium in combating infections caused by resistant Gram-positive pathogens, namely, MRSA.', '', '', 'SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD', '2049-9361', '', '', '', 'Journal', '', 'NO', 'SCI', 'NO', 'NO', '', 1, '', '2019-02-08 10:25:13', '7621NA2019-02-08 10:25:13'),

Interphase zone is characterized by employing a cohesive zone model for its elastic modulus and thickness. An equivalent solid fiber (ESF) of CNT and interphase is modeled and dispersed into the matrix material by utilizing random sequential adsorption (RSA) technique. The effective elastic properties of the nanocomposite are computed by finite element method (FEM) based numerical homogenization technique. The obtained elastic properties of nanocomposite are utilized to investigate the buckling and post-buckling behaviour of different functionally graded (i.e., FG) nanocomposite plates modeled by varying the volume fraction of CNT/ESF along thickness direction, under in-plane compressive loads. The non-linear formulation is based on first-order shear deformation theory and von Karman\'s assumptions. It is found that considering the interphase between CNT and Mg matrix would result in decrease in buckling load and postbuckling strength of FG-CNT-reinforced nanocomposite plate as compared to nanocomposite without interphase. It is also reported that the higher volume fraction of CNTs near top and bottom surfaces than the middle portion of nanocomposite plate provide better resistance to buckling and postbuckling.

A two-phase nanoscale formulation is adopted which is more appropriate for biophysical systems. The flow is induced by metachronal beating of cilia and the flow geometry is considered as a cylindrical tube. The analysis is carried out under the low Reynolds number and long wavelength approximations and the fluid and cilia dynamics is of the creeping type. A Lorentzian magnetic body force model is employed and magnetic induction effects are neglected. Solutions to the transformed boundary value problem are obtained via numerical integration. The influence of cilia length parameter, Hartmann (magnetic) number, heat absorption parameter, Grashof number (free convection), solid nanoparticle volume fraction, and cilia eccentricity parameter on the flow and heat transfer characteristics (including effective thermal conductivity of the nanofluid) are examined in detail. Furthermore a comparative study for different nanoparticle geometries (i.e. bricks, platelets and cylinders) is conducted. The computations show that pressure increases with enhancing the heat absorption, buoyancy force (i.e. Grashof number) and nanoparticle fraction however it reduces with increasing the magnetic field. The computations also reveal that pressure enhancement is a maximum for the platelet nano-particle case compared with the brick and cylinder nanoparticle cases. Furthermore the quantity of trapped streamlines for cylinder type nanoparticles exceeds substantially that computed for brick and platelet nanoparticles, whereas the bolus magnitude (trapped zone) for brick nanoparticles is demonstrably greater than that obtained for cylinder and platelet nanoparticles.

These oscillations occur far from conventional resonance and Floquet theory shows them to be unique to these systems. Of particular interest is the bulk topological insulator (TI) where the wave-vector dependent frequency of the ARO is seen to be gapped in topologically trivial situations and gapless when there is a non-vanishing Chern number. It is shown that the Chern number may be directly inferred by performing a pump-probe experiment in the bulk without referring to surface states. A simpler alternative to the Lindblad method is invoked in order to incorporate dephasing effects that despite leading to a non-unitary time evolution of the wave-function, is nevertheless, probability conserving. The differential transmission coefficient versus the pump pulse duration (when all else is held fixed) has the form of a sinusoidal function with an amplitude that decays as a power law in the pump duration (alternatively, the â€œareaâ€ of the pump pulse). The exponent of this power law decay is indicative of the Chern number of the bulk in case of TI and more generally indicative of the particular member of the family of materials that may be collectively referred to as â€“ Dirac-Weyl materials.

Inspired by multi-disciplinary progress and innovation in this direction, a thermo-fluid mechanical model is proposed to study the entropy generation and convective heat transfer of nanofluids fabricated by the dispersion of single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) nanoparticles in water as the base fluid. The regime studied comprises heat transfer and steady, viscous, incompressible flow, induced by metachronal wave propulsion due to beating cilia, through a cylindrical tube containing a sparse (i.e., high permeability) homogenous porous medium. The flow is of the creeping type and is restricted under the low Reynolds number and long wavelength approximations. Slip effects at the wall are incorporated and the generalized Darcy drag-force model is utilized to mimic porous media effects. Cilia boundary conditions for velocity components are employed to determine analytical solutions to the resulting non-dimensionalized boundary value problem. The influence of pertinent physical parameters on temperature, axial velocity, pressure rise and pressure gradient, entropy generation function, Bejan number and stream-line distributions are computed numerically. A comparative study between SWCNT-nanofluids and pure water is also computed. The computations demonstrate that axial flow is accelerated with increasing slip parameter and Darcy number and is greater for SWCNT-nanofluids than for pure water. Furthermore the size of the bolus for SWCNT-nanofluids is larger than that of the pure water. The study is applicable in designing and fabricating nanoscale and microfluidics devices, artificial cilia and biomimetic micro-pumps.

The cellular mechanism of asbestos toxicity to a certain extent, as shown by research, is attributed to its chemical composition particularly the presence of iron in its structure. Many bacteria release iron chelating compounds, siderophores, which could be instrumental in the study. Treatment of asbestos was carried out under specific parameters with bacterial isolates native to the mines of Rajasthan from which asbestos was collected. An assessment was then done to evaluate reduction in iron content of the asbestos fibres by Scanning Electron Microscopy-Energy Dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX).

Performed ZT calculations demonstrates reasonably good thermoelectric performance for both materials, as there exist minor variation (0.1) in the values over wide temperature ranges i.e. from 100 to 800 K.

Most of the proposed mobile agent based schemes use static itineraries for agents\' migration that are computed at the sink using a centralized algorithm. These centralized algorithms require global knowledge of sensor distribution, which is difficult to obtain accurately. Other issue with static itinerary based agent migration is that an agent may not move along its itinerary due to node failures or malicious node attacks. In order to solve these issues, we first propose a framework for trust evaluation to identify the malicious behavior of sensor nodes and then give a localized distributed protocol, called energy and trust aware mobile agent migration (ETMAM) protocol for periodic data gathering application.

Abstract: A total of 40 accessions of a multipurpose leguminous tree, Pithecellobium dulce, differing in morphological and phenological characteristics was collected from different locations in Rajasthan and genetic diversity assessed using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers. Out of 60 RAPD primers, 43 decamer primers produced 311 scorable bands of which 223 bands were polymorphic. Polymorphic banding patterns with the number of amplified fragments varied from 1 (OPA-12 and OPF-17) to 12 (OPF-04, OPT-07, OPT-17, OPT-20). Percent polymorphism ranged from 33.3Â % (OPF-07, OPA-20, OPT-05) to 89Â % (OPA-13) with an average of 64.34Â %. Out of the 20 ISSR primers screened, 8 primers produced 77 amplification products of which 55 were polymorphic. The number of bands amplified per primer varied between 6 (UBC-820) and 13 (UBC-808 and UBC-816) with average band size between 300 and 4,500Â bp. Percent polymorphism ranged from 38Â % (UBC-817) to 100Â % (UBC-811) with an average of 71Â %. Dendrogram constructed on the basis of combined RAPD and ISSR markers separated the accessions into five distinct clusters at 53Â % variation with Jaccardâ€™s similarity coefficient ranging from minimum similarity (0.35) between Karoli (K) and Malviya Nagar, Jaipur (MN1) to maximum similarity (0.81) between two populations of Kota (K1 and K2). The matrices for two markers, RAPD and ISSR, were also compared using Mantelâ€™s test. The correlation value between the matrices is high (rÂ =Â 0.83) indicating good correlation between the two molecular marker systems. The study indicated a high level of morphological and genetic diversity in P. dulce.

Timely extraction of such effects is highly required so that early warnings can be raised against if any serious beforehand to save patients from any further loss. It also helps in framing alternate treatment plan. There are two different ways for identifying the side effects of drugs. First is premarketing trials, which are conducted before floating drugs into market. But this approach is not as effective as these trials are carried out on a restricted population for restricted time. That is why another approach called as postmarketing surveillance is used. Under this approach, data mining techniques have been applied frequently for finding adverse reactions of drugs. But most of the existing techniques are based on the assumption that all attributes are equally responsible for drug side effects which may not be applicable for all real-life cases.

In this paper, we consider the asynchronous vacation policy for the multi-server machine repair problem with server breakdown and two types of spares. According to this policy, when a certain number of servers become idle at a service completion instant, the servers will take an asynchronous vacation of random length together. If the servers find no waiting failed unit in the system and the number of servers on vacation is less than the total number of servers, then these servers can take vacation individually and continue to take vacation if the vacation condition is satisfied. Each server is subject to breakdowns in working state only and can be repaired according to exponential service time distribution. Matrix geometric method is used to obtain the queue size distribution. Various performance measures viz. the expected number of the idle servers, busy servers and vacationing servers, etc. are determined. The sensitivity analysis is made to examine the effect of parameters on various performance measures.

Most of the work reported on analog chaotic communication is based on the pioneer work of Pecora and Caroll, with synchronization between transmitter and receiver. Receiver based on synchronization, also known as coherent receiver, has a disadvantage of parameter mismatch and is sensitive to noise. In the present work, firstly, a secure transmitter using chaotic DC-DC converters is proposed that encrypts information using chaotic switching map technique. In chaotic switching map technique, the message is encrypted by randomly switching from one chaotic converter to another. The bifurcation parameter of the randomly switched chaotic converter is modulated by the message. Secondly, an attempt has been made to design a robust non-coherent receiver that is adaptable to the switching chaotic transmitters, even in the presence of noise. Once the receiver identifies the chaotic converter, it can decode the message as per the decryption algorithm. With the proposed non-coherent receiver, the disadvantages of coherent receivers can be overcome. We have also devised a prototype smart meter, used in smart distribution grid for implementing the proposed communication technique.

Leaves have shown dense colonies of endophytic fungi. Microscopic examination of in vitro and in vivo leaves has shown mycelium which was dense, branched and septate. Hence, the comparative study was conducted in both in vitro and in vivo leaves of T. cord ifolia to locate endophytic fungi.

Therefore, the present research work favoured the view that endophytes can infect nutrient medium of in vitro culture of T. cord ifolia and diversity of endophytic fungi increase after hardening and acclimatization of T. cord ifolia plantlets. The presence of endophytes in in vitro cultures depends both on age of tissue and host genotype.

The main objective of financial inclusion is to connect all individualwith banking system. This connection will lead to uplift their standard of living and overall development of the economy. The current government in the last year came up with extremelymotivated project, the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) in August 2015. The prime objective of the PMJDY is to ensure financial inclusion of the poor and rural population by giving them selfesteem, financial liberty and financial constancy. This scheme is a national mission on financial inclusion. It has the objective of covering all households in the country having a bank account and other banking facilities.This paper focusesthe evaluation of this scheme with reference to rural people of Bagru village of Jaipur City in Rajasthan. It also aims to highlight the present scenario of PMJDY in 2016 with the help of some true stories.', '', '', 'Serials Publications', '09727302', '', '', '', 'Journal', '', 'SCOPUS', '', 'NO', 'NO', '', 1, '', '2019-02-08 07:10:35', '9765NA2019-02-08 07:10:35'),

This paper reports optical gain realized in Al0.8Ga0.2As/GaAs0.8P0.2 type-I QW-heterostructure (varying well width 6nm-22nm). Band alignment, wavefunctions and optical gain of the nano-scale heterostructure under electromagnetic field perturbation is reported. The 6Ã—6 diagonalised k. p Hamiltonian matrix is evaluated and Luttinger-Kohn model has been applied for the band structure calculations. Optical gain spectrum in the QW-heterostructure under external electric fields of (20, 40 and 60 kV/cm) is calculated. Optical gain (x and z polarizations) of the nano-scale heterostructure under well width and temperature variations is investigated. The optical gain spectrum of the heterostructure is seen to gradually rise with shrinking well width. Also the optical gain curve shows a decrease in gain with rising temperature levels. For a charge carrier injection of 4 Ã— 1012/cm2 the optical gain is âˆ¼220 under input x polarization [100] and âˆ¼625 under z polarization [001] at 300K. The heterostructure is seen to be operating in the energy range of 1.5 to 1.75 eV (708 to 826 nm). Thus, a wide range wavelength tuning is achievable.

The magnetic Compton profiles (MCPs) have been analyzed in terms of site specific spin moments due to Tb-4f electrons, Co and itinerant electrons. The temperature dependence of the orbital moment has been deduced using Compton and magnetometry data ranging between 6 and 300 K. The present data exhibit a decrease in the ratio of orbital to spin moments from 43.9\\% to 35.0\\% (while going from 6 to 300 K). First-principles calculations within DFT + U scheme have also been performed to confirm the spin-, orbital-and site specific-magnetic moments in TbCo2. An antiparallel exchange coupling between the Tb-4f and Co spin moments is found. The orbital moment is found to have a parallel coupling with the Tb spin moment, as evident from the experimental MCPs. From first-principles data it is seen that the orbital moments of Tb and Co sites are antiparallel to each other, as in the case of their spin magnetic moments. The present experimental study also shows an existence of an itinerant moment which is coupled ferromagnetically with the Tb-4f spin moment. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Handoff is a process to maintain data session continuity where mobile node changes from one base station coverage area to another base station area. Mobile maintains its existing connections via vertical handoff. In wireless environment single node mobility is known as host mobility and group of nodes moving together as single network is known as Network Mobility (NEMO). NEMO is extension of MIPv6, invented for reducing number of individual handoffs. To influence smooth mobility between these heterogeneous wireless access networks, expeditious and dependable vertical handoff (VHO) schemes are required. While taking VHO decision several parameters has to consider like received signal strength (RSS), addressable bandwidth, power intake, monetary cost, security, user predilection and etc. In this paper various handoff decision techniques based on different parameters for host mobility, and vertical handoff technique for Network mobility (NEMO) are discussed. Finally gave research issues and future research directions to NEMO.
