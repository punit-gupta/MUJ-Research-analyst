Cloud CDN (CCDN) lowers network latency, offloads origin, and reduces service costs. In this paper, we propose a 2-tier structure for video streaming, one which uses CCDN and priority based round robin scheduling algorithm and the 2nd which creates a dedicated Peer to Peer network for each video and uses chunk based distribution with videos hashed using DHT. The scheduling algorithm in the 1st tier of our proposed structure efficiently balances load of the central node and the P2P network, along with DHT in the 2nd tier provide for efficient distribution of chunks of videos, reducing the buffer time.

One remarkable aspect of this study is that a new micro-convection model namely Patel model has been introduced in view of enhancement of thermal conductivity and hence more heat transfer capability of nanofluid. The non-linear partial differential equations have been converted into strong non-linear ordinary differential equations by employing suitable transformations and these transformed equations are solved by Runga-Kutta method of fourth order along with Shooting technique as well as Secant method for better approximation. From this study, it is found that the presence of magnetic field slows down the fluid motion while it enhances the fluid temperature leading to a reduction in heat transfer rate from the surface. It is also found that enhancing thermal radiation parameter causes a reduction in heat transfer rate.

This will protract the lifetime of sensor networks. However, a cluster head has to perform various tasks such as collection of data from member nodes, aggregation of the collected data, and send that data to the BS. Network load balance is a challenging issue in WSNs for the clustering schemes. Genetic algorithms (GA) with clustering schemes are implemented for better cluster formation. The GA run through again over a large no of iterations to find the optimal solution that leads to premature convergence. The chaotic GA (CGA) will solve this problem by avoiding local convergence, i.e., by choosing a chaotic map to generate the random values instead of traditional random function and improves the performance of the traditional GA. A chaotic GA (CGA) based clustering algorithm for WSNs has been proposed in the proposed work that has better convergence rate for cluster head selection and consequently improves the performance of sensor network.

It is a well-known fact that in most of the real world applications related to WSNs, the deployment is random as manual deployment is not possible due to harsh environments and other complexities. Therefore, there is no prior knowledge about the position of the sensor nodes that are deployed to form a wireless sensor network. In order to overcome this aspect related to position estimate of sensor nodes various localization schemes and algorithms have been proposed. The schemes and algorithms proposed so far also offer advantages like optimal routing, energy conservation, security, topology control besides providing the accurate position estimation of deployed sensor nodes. This paper explicitly presents a survey on the existing learning and non-learning based algorithms that have special role in localization of sensor nodes for WSNs. Methods: Comparative analysis of prominent learning and non-learning based algorithms. The analysis is based in terms of physical measurement, accuracy, computation and hardware cost and energy efficiency. Result: Detailed reporting of learning and non-learning based algorithms with their sub-categories. The study and survey of various algorithms throw light on their applicability and use for WSNs.

But the main challenge of Wireless Sensor Networks lies in achieving communications with low energy consumption. In order to overcome the problem of energy consumption, a well-known clustering algorithm, LEACH (Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy) was designed. However, LEACH has some disadvantages. In this paper, we propose a new clustering algorithm based on LEACH. It establishes a new Threshold which includes the node energy and distance between node and base station and distance between cluster head and base station for measuring the threshold value. Simulation results show that proposed algorithm is better than LEACH in balancing the node energy and thus enhancing the network lifetime.

The demand for composite materials is increasing due to their superior properties such as high strength to weight ratio, good corrosion resistance and high stiffness. Post machining operations such as drilling, orthogonal cutting, turning are necessary for composite materials to meet the dimensional and functional requirements. Drilling is a major process in manufacturing of holes, required for assembling the components in industrial applications. Drilling of holes in composites leads to a drilling-induced damage called delamination. The researchers have tried to reduce the drilling-induced damage by minimizing the operating variables and tool design. However, the research on delamination analysis using finite element method (FEM) is limited. This paper provides a comprehensive literature review on machining of composites which mainly focuses on conventional methods like turning, milling, trimming and drilling and also on simulation methods including discrete element method and finite element method. A brief and in depth review for drilling of composites using finite element method is delivered, which provides a knowledge on damage of the composites caused during drilling and orthogonal cutting.

Recent studies depict that the performance of network and its utilization can be enhanced by QoS (Quality of Service) routing protocol. Thus, QoS is the essence of the WSNs. So, in this paper, we would like to present a detailed survey of the various routing protocols which play a vital role in attaining the QoS in WSNs. Methods: There are various levels of QoS which are required by the WSNs depending on the applications that they focus upon. The QoS support to WSNs can be achieved by various routing protocols. Thus, a detailed research on various routing protocols is done depicting their strengths and weakness and a comparison table of various protocols on various parameters is provided. Results: The QoS basically aims to focus on the quality that is perceived by the users of various applications. The QoS facilitates the above aim in terms of delay, packet delivery ratio, reduction in power of the sensor nodes, energy efficiency, bandwidth utilization, amount of through put generated and many other factors. However, there are few challenges faced by QoS which may occur due to dynamic topology and constrained resources. Even after these challenges the research suggests QoS is undisputedly the essence of WSNs. Conclusion: The QoS is very advantageous as it helps in improving the service provided to the users, and is accountable in improving the quality of output perceived by the users of various applications. Researchers have started working to overcome the challenges of QoS with the aim to minimize its constraints and maximize its multiple objectives.

On the basis of the scanned objects morphology, two important process parameters are specified namely scanning angle and distance of the laser from the part surface. Experiments have been performed with different scanning conditions using full factorial design. An analytical prediction model for determining the standard deviation of the final surface is developed in terms of the aforesaid scanning parameters using response surface methodology (RSM). Furthermore, the optimal scanning parameters are predicted after comparing two almost unexplored nature inspired algorithms i.e. Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) and Moth-Flame Optimization (MFO). Finally, two realistic non-trivial case studies are considered for validation of the proposed methodology. The result shows that the standard deviation of the final reverse engineered models significantly reduced by 21.6% and 13.77%.

Recent research efforts have shown that dynamic and cyclic loading may effectively prevent or reverse bone resorption as loading enhances osteogenesis. Loading-induced canalicular fluid flow in bone is considered as a potential stimulus of new bone formation. It is believed that poroelastic material properties such as porosity and permeability typically decide fluid flow in canalicular spaces of bone. Accordingly, the authors hypothesized that changes in poroelastic material properties with age may affect the fluid flow, which in turn affects the new bone response against any external mechanical stimulation. This work attempts to relate the age-related changes in poroelastic material properties to fluid-flow distribution in lacuna-canalicular spaces of bone. The outcomes may be useful in the development of effective strategies to enhance the canalicular fluid flow, so that optimal exercises or sports activities can be designed to prevent or reverse the age-related bone loss.

This is when mobile agents are used for data aggregation to exploit redundant and correlated data. The efficiency of agent-based data aggregation depends on the agent migration scheme. However, in general, most of the proposed schemes are centralized approach-based schemes where the sink node determines the migration paths for the agents before dispatching them in the sensor network. The main limitations with such schemes are that they need global network topology information for deriving the migration paths of the agents, which incurs additional communication overhead, since each node has a very limited communication range. In addition, a centralized approach does not provide fault tolerant and adaptive migration paths. In order to solve such problems, we have proposed a distributed approach-based scheme for determining the migration path of the agents where at each hop, the local information is used to decide the migration of the agents. In addition, we also propose a local repair mechanism for dealing with the faulty nodes. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme performs better than existing schemes in the presence of faulty nodes within the networks, and manages to report the aggregated data to the sink faster.

The proposed work is a two-step method, firstly the siting and sizing of DG is obtained by two stage Genetic Algorithm (GA) to improve the voltage profile and to reduce the active power losses. A two stage GA ensures a faster convergence and better quality of solutions. Finally the proposed improved hybrid method is applied to detect the bus most susceptible for islanding under varying operating conditions.

Data sharing in this form calls for the need of high bandwidth consumption which may slow down the network resulting in performance degradation of content delivery networks due to congestion. Several attempts have been made by the researchers to propose various techniques and algorithms to achieve optimal performance of the network resources under high-usage circumstances. But due to high-dense network architectures, the performance implementations of suggested algorithms for congestion may not be able to produce the desired results in real time. In this paper, we have presented an optimized multi-core architecture-based parallel version of two congestion control algorithmsâ€”leaky bucket and choke packet. The experimental results over a dense network show that optimized parallel implementation using OpenMP programming specification gets the network rebalancing in a very short span of time as compared to its serial counterpart. The proposed approach runs 60% faster than the serial implementation. The graphical map for the speed up continues to increase with the size of the network and routers.

The reason can be attributed mainly to the enhanced lifetime and less energy consumption as compared to the other mentioned types. However one important aspect needs attention, the impact of driver on LEDs. LEDs are current controlled devices and hence emit maximum light with increase in current input to the device. This feature, boost up the light output but it increases the junction temperature of the device. Hence additional heat sinks are required to vent out the excessive heat generated due to increase current input to the LEDs. Those additional heat sinks are at times difficult to accommodate. So, designers have made arrangements to vent out the heat from the device. This is achieved by designing fins. However this arrangement is not suitable in places where the ambient temperature is more than normal. Thus, design of LED driver with controlled current input is essential in order to maintain the thermal limit of the device. Secondly, the AC-DC LEDs driver circuits, which are available in the market, are seldom equipped with input power factor and THD improvement circuitry as prescribed in IEC61000- 3-2. This is essential for maintaining the energy efficiency of the nearest utility services and in addition also improves on the current drawn by the device. The following work envisages these issues and proposes corrective driver circuit based on two different driver topologies, buck-boost topology and flyback topology. Both these topologies are proposed in order to address the aspects of power quality and its impact on the life of the device.

Inspired by multi-disciplinary progress and innovation in this direction, a thermo-fluid mechanical model is proposed to study the entropy generation and convective heat transfer of nanofluids fabricated by the dispersion of single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) nanoparticles in water as the base fluid. The regime studied comprises heat transfer and steady, viscous, incompressible flow, induced by metachronal wave propulsion due to beating cilia, through a cylindrical tube containing a sparse (i.e., high permeability) homogenous porous medium. The flow is of the creeping type and is restricted under the low Reynolds number and long wavelength approximations. Slip effects at the wall are incorporated and the generalized Darcy drag-force model is utilized to mimic porous media effects. Cilia boundary conditions for velocity components are employed to determine analytical solutions to the resulting non-dimensionalized boundary value problem. The influence of pertinent physical parameters on temperature, axial velocity, pressure rise and pressure gradient, entropy generation function, Bejan number and stream-line distributions are computed numerically. A comparative study between SWCNT-nanofluids and pure water is also computed. The computations demonstrate that axial flow is accelerated with increasing slip parameter and Darcy number and is greater for SWCNT-nanofluids than for pure water. Furthermore the size of the bolus for SWCNT-nanofluids is larger than that of the pure water. The study is applicable in designing and fabricating nanoscale and microfluidics devices, artificial cilia and biomimetic micro-pumps.

A multi-stage optimization strategy for the optimal solution of FLC for tie-line and frequency oscillation suppression is proposed in this paper using an ant colony optimization technique. The optimization of FLC is carried out in four different stages. The first stage is the optimization of range of input and output variables; the second stage is the optimization of membership function; the third and fourth stages are the optimization for rule base and rule weight optimization, respectively. The performance of the proposed controller is also compared with another control approaches to stabilize Ptie-line and Î”f oscillations; these are the Zieglerâ€“Nichols-tuned proportionalâ€“integralâ€“derivative (PID) controller and genetic algorithm optimized PID controller. A comprehensive analysis of the traditional techniques and proposed techniques is presented on the basis of major dynamic performance parameters, i.e., settling time and peak overshoot.

All the fungal strains produce phenolics ranging from 5.2 to 16.7 mg/ml and demonstrated various free radical and metal ion scavenging activity. Growth medium significantly affected all the activities. Almost similar antioxidant activity (~ 72% DPPH scavenging activity) was demonstrated by all the fungi in yeast extract glucose medium; however, the activity was lower in Czapek doxâ€™s medium (from 60 to 45%). Indole acetic acid production was maximum in P. brevispora (31 Î¼g/ml), which was closely followed by P. chrysosporium and P. floridensis. The extracts did not show any mutagenic or cytotoxic effect.

Almost 60%-80% of the children coming to pediatric and endocrinology outpatient department for the evaluation of short stature are still labeled as idiopathic. Objectives: The aim of this study is to identify various chromosomal alterations causing idiopathic short stature (ISS) and short stature with dysmorphic features not pertaining to known genetic syndromes. Materials and Methods: After exclusion of all nutritional, systemic, endocrine, and syndromic causes of short stature, 19 patients with height <2 standard deviation scores were subjected to chromosomal microarray (CMA) study using Affymetrix CytoScan 750K array and CMA Scanner 3000 platform. Results: We identified total 61 copy-number variant (CNV) and polymorphs (33 gains, 11 loss, and 17 gain-mosaics) not described as normal variants in database of genomic variations. We identified SHOX haploinsufficiency as a cause of short stature in two patients, whereas one patient was gain-mosaic for SHOX. All three had normal conventional karyotype. One of these patients also had deletion of PAX3, which could be the cause of both short stature and associated mild intellectual impairment in this patient. We also found a long noncoding RNA, namely, KIAA0125 and a pseudogene ADAM6 in 18 out of our 19 patients which might have a regulatory role. Conclusion: This study shows that CMA is a very promising tool for the identification of pathogenic CNVs in patients with ISS. It can also help to identify novel genes controlling height and can open up new insight into pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying ISS, and thus may help to unfold new therapeutic targets for treatment of this condition. The association of CNV having genes for long noncoding RNAs, such as KIAA0125 and pseudogene such as ADAM6 with ISS suggest that they may play a role in controlling the expression of height-related genes and it needs further investigations.

Looking at the traditional machine learning techniques, tasks like to handle the data which is distributed identically or in batch mode becomes impossible and there is requirement to develop new algorithms to overcome with the existing difficulties faced by these traditional ML algorithms. The objective of this chapter is to provide overall view of developed algorithms and paradigm shifts of current big data analysis using machine learning approach to compute data. Here we will explore that the machine learning field has great impact on cloud computing paradigm. In first step we deploy various tool to the cloud like libraries and statistics tools. In second step we embed plugins with current tools in order to make Hadoop cluster on the cloud so that working programs can run on it. In third step libraries of machine learning algorithms are deployed and used for data intensive computing. Â© 2018 The authors and IOS Press.

However, our understanding of how bioengineered nanoparticles may affect organisms within natural ecosystems, lags far behind our rapidly increasing ability to engineer novel nanoparticles. To date, research on the biological impacts of bioengineered nanoparticles has primarily consisted of controlled lab studies of model organisms with single species in culture media. Here, we described a cost effective and environment friendly technique for green synthesis of silver nanoparticles. Silver nanoparticles were successfully synthesized from 1?mM AgNO3 via a green synthesis process using leaf extract as reducing as well as capping agent. Nanoparticles were characterized with the help of UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and TEM analysis which revealed the size of nanoparticles of 30-40?nm size. Further the nanoparticles synthesized by green route are found highly toxic against pathogenic bacteria and plant pathogenic fungi viz. Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas syringae and Sclerotiniasclerotiorum. The most important outcome of this work will be the development of value-Added products and protection of human health from pathogens viz., bacteria, virus, fungi etc. Â© 2016 Author(s).', '', '', 'American Institute of Physics Inc.', '0094243X', '9780735413757', '', '', 'Conference Paper', '', 'SCOPUS', '', '', '', ''),

Methods The governing equations are reduced in linear form using dimensional analysis and considering the low Reynolds number and large wavelength approximations. The time dependent temperature field, axial velocity, transverse velocity and pressure difference are obtained analytically in closed form solution. Trapping phenomenon is also discussed with the help of contour plots of stream function. A comparative study of pure water (Newtonian fluid), Copper water nanofluids and Silver water nanofluids under the influence of relevant physical parameters is made in graphical form and also discussed. The effects of absorption parameter and Grashof number on velocity profiles, temperature profiles and pressure distribution along the length of channel are examined. Results conclusions The computational results reveal that the velocity profile is maximum for Silver water nanofluids however, it is least for Copper water nanofluids. It is also concluded the temperature profile is more for pure water in comparison to Silver water and Copper water nanofluids. This model is applicable to design, micro-peristaltic pumps which help in Nanoparticle-based targeted drug delivery and to transport the sensitive or corrosive fluids, sanitary fluids, slurries and noxious fluids in nuclear industry.

The synthesis of AgNPs was investigated using ultraviolet (UV)-visible spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis. Process optimisation exhibited AgNPs synthesis within 8 h using 2 mM AgNO3 at pH 11 and temperature 70Â°C. TEM analysis revealed polydispersed ellipsoidal shaped AgNPs with average particle size 96.8 nm as measured by DLS. AgNPs showed negative zeta potential that confers surface stability in solution. FTIR spectra confirmed the presence of protein bound to AgNPs. Antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus by the AgNPs (100 ppm) was demonstrated by counting colony forming unit, disc diffusion, and growth kinetics assay. Additionally radial assay revealed antifungal activity of AgNPs (100 ppm) against phytopathogenic fungi Sclerotinia sclerotiorum Microbial type culture collection 8785. Furthermore, AgNPs (100 ppm) did not show any cytotoxic effects on human Red blood cells.

An in-depth study was carried out to biosynthesize, characterize and assess any possible mutagenic potential and ecotoxicity of the microbial polysaccharide biopolymer. Microstructural investigations using confocal microscopy, Fourier transform (FT)-Raman depth profile mapping and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the biosynthetically modified polysaccharide revealed internal structural perturbations, as well as occlusion of granular pores by extraneous materials. The Raman 3D mapping depth profile along with time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry also indicated important structural and surface modifications, which could be correlated to the production of microbial exopolysaccharides and secondary metabolites. The study then looked into any possible genetic mutation and ecological risks associated with the biosynthetically modified polysaccharide through the investigation of genotoxicity and ecotoxicity. The genotoxicity study was carried out through bacterial reverse gene mutation (Ames) test by using two different strains (TA98 and TA100) of bacteria. The results did not indicate any mutagenic effect against either of the strains used for the biopolymer samples and was found to be genotoxically safe. Ecotoxicity tests, carried out using bioluminescent bacteria Vibrio fisheri further indicated no ecotoxicity within the given experimental conditions. The study measured the half maximal effective concentration (EC50) to cause a 50% decrease in the light output of the bacteria, a measure of ecotoxicological response of the biopolymer. Overall, results from this study indicated that the novel biopolymer was genotoxically and ecotoxically safe, which offers immense potential for future use of this biopolymer.

The inclusion of frequency doubling effect (counter rotating term) in the conventional rotating wave approximation (RWA) changes the resonance condition thereby producing a rather small shift in the resonance condition, which is known as the Bloch-Siegert shift (BSS). Rabi oscillations in Dirac-Weyl fermionic systems exhibit anomalous behavior far from resonance, called anomalous Rabi oscillations. Therefore, in the present work, we study the phenomenon of the Bloch-Siegert shift in Weyl semimetal and topological insulator (TI) far from resonance, called anomalous Bloch-Siegert shift (ABSS). It is seen that the change in the resonance condition of anomalous Rabi oscillations is drastic in Weyl semimetal and TI. The ABSS in Weyl semimetals is highly anisotropic, whereas it is isotropic in TI. In case of TI, it is the Chern number which plays a crucial role to produce substantial change in the ABSS.

Recently, Hou & Quan (2011) have developed a progressive scheme for secret sharing. It is observed that shares generated by the scheme are free from pixel expansion problem, but shares are not fully secure. In this paper, a new progressive sharing algorithm based on logistic chaotic map has been proposed to overcome the said limitation of Hou (2011) scheme. The irregular outputs of the logistic map are used to encode a secret digital information carrying image. The performance of the algorithm in the scheme of Hou (2011) is critically analyzed and compared with new suggested scheme.

In the last two decades, there has been a plenteous study in energy harnessing. Now a day, energy harnessing using piezoelectric materials has drawn attention of researchers due to low cost, flexibility and light weight. The benefits of piezoelectric material can be utilized by designing a self-powered device for artificial nanoswimmer. Some of the ceramics which displays the piezoelectric effect are lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT), lead-titanate (PbTiO2), lead-zirconate (PbZrO3) and Barium Titanate (BaTiO3). PZT is most extensively used piezoelectric material in the field of energy harnessing but it is brittle in nature. Lead based piezoelectric materials are toxic in nature and may not suitable for in-vivo biomedical applications. To eradicate this problem, researchers are interested in synthesizing lead free piezoelectric material such as Aluminium Nitride (AIN), Barium Titanate (BaTiO3) and Polyvinylidenefluoride (PVDF). The biocompatibility of PVDF makes it appropriate to be used for energy harnessing in human body for applications like on board powering of nanoswimmer for various disease detection and drug delivery. In this paper, a cantilever beam is being simulated in COMSOL to study electric potential generated on the surface of beam made of different piezoelectric materials such as AIN, PVDF and PZT due to fluidic pressure, which will be utilized as energy for actuation of artificial nanoswimmer. Piezo-based cantilever beams have been compared and maximum electric potential is being observed in PVDF based beam. PVDF seems most promising piezoelectric material for in-vivo biomedical application and it is readily available.

Crimes affect the quality of life, economic growth, and reputation of a nation. There has been an enormous increase in crime rate in the last few years. In order to reduce the crime rate, the law enforcements need to take the preventive measures. With the aim of securing the society from crimes, there is a need for advanced systems and new approaches for improving the crime analytics for protecting their communities. Accurate real-time crime predictions help to reduce the crime rate but remains challenging problem for the scientific community as crime occurrences depend on many complex factors. In this work, various visualizing techniques and machine learning algorithms are adopted for predicting the crime distribution over an area. In the first step, the raw datasets were processed and visualized based on the need. Afterwards, machine learning algorithms were used to extract the knowledge out of these large datasets and discover the hidden relationships among the data which is further used to report and discover the crime patterns that is valuable for crime analysts to analyse these crime networks by the means of various interactive visualizations for crime prediction and hence is supportive in prevention of crimes.

In the last 30 years, scientists have investigated various cyanobacteria for novel mycosporine-like amino acids, applying different induction techniques. This review organizes all the cyanobacterial groups that produce various mycosporine-like amino acids. We found out that cyanobacteria belonging to orders Synechococcales, Chroococcales, Oscillatoriales, and Nostocales are frequently studied for the presence of mycosporine-like amino acids, while orders Gloeobacterales, Spirulinales, Pleurocapsales, and Chroococcidiopsidales are still need to be investigated.

Available inorganic and organic chemicals used in commercial sunscreen have deleterious activity in vivo. Therefore, there is a need of a safe and natural sunscreen. Cyanobacteria are the impressive source of natural products and they can be exploited industrially. Cyanobacteria synthesize the UV absorbing compounds like mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) and scytonemin. MAAs are water-soluble molecules (188 to 1050 Da) that absorb UV-A and UV-B radiation and disperse the energy as heat. Scytonemin is a lipid soluble pigment (544 Da) having absorption maxima at 380 nm. They are promising natural alternatives for both direct (UV-absorption) and indirect (antioxidant) protection. These molecules show strong photostability and do not have any cytotoxic effects. The search for natural UV protective molecules is relatively recent, providing two commercial products (Helioguard(r) and Helionori(r)) containing MAAs extract from red alga Porphyra umbilicalis. Still commercialization of potential photoprotective molecules is required for the development of a better and safe sunscreen. Therefore, for improvement in their expression levels, a complete understanding of biosynthetic pathway of MAAs and scytonemin is essential. Additionally, an economic and sustainable method for extraction of these molecules from cyanobacteria is also required for large-scale production. Future perspectives include the heterologous expression of MAAs and/or scytonemin in industrially friendly microorganisms in order to co-produce different UV protective molecules and thus cover a broader UV spectrum and simplify the production process.

Once the receiver identifies the chaotic converter, it can decode the message as per the decryption algorithm. With the proposed non-coherent receiver, the disadvantages of coherent receivers can be overcome. We have also devised a prototype smart meter, used in smart distribution grid for implementing the proposed communication technique. Copyright Â© 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The antenna has a unique shape and has been fed through a 50 Ï‰ microstrip feedline. The strength of the antenna lies in three band notched properties for WiMax system at 3.3-3.7 GHz, WLAN IEEE 802.11a at 5.15-5.85 GHz and X band satellite communication at 7.25-8.395 GHz. The notched bands have been achieved by incorporating an inverted U-slot etched on the radiator patch, an inverted C-slot also on the radiator patch and a U-slot on the microstrip feed line. In order to achieve FCC defined impedance bandwidth of 7.5 GHz, a rectangular cut in the ground plane has been introduced along with staircase structure in the bottom edge of the radiator. The proposed antenna is having a compact size of 30 X 30 X 1.6 mm3 and exhibits a large bandwidth from 2.8 GHz to 10.7 GHz. The antenna has been successfully simulated and fabricated. The radiation pattern is omni-directional in H-plane and the E-plane exhibits dipole like radiation pattern. The gain of the antenna is stable across the whole operating frequency band except at three notched bands.

A good wavelength selective filter with bandwidth about 10.20nm and centre wavelength of pass band 1.4201um is achieved. In the next design, photonic crystal quasi-square cavity based ADF is realised with elliptical scatters for different major and minor axis configurations thus having different ellipticity. It is observed that the output response of the filter is very sensitive to the dimensions of coupling rods and scatter rods. It is observed that when the radius of the scatter rods is increased, then the centre wavelength of the bands get shifted towards higher wavelength range.

From the research conducted so far it is understood that life time resource of LEDs is mainly dependent on junction temperature. For most of the high power LEDs, which are enclosed inside a luminaire, dissipation of junction heat from the device is a major concern for most of the manufacturers. In this paper, an attempt has been made to investigate the underlying constraints of heat dissipation and subsequently using LEDs as a general light source. The investigation is carried out in two steps. Firstly, the degradation in light output with corresponding increase in ambient temperature is explored. Secondly, the impact of increase in T-point temperature on the lifetime of the LEDs is observed. The experiment is conducted using high power LEDs and the same is subjected to external thermal stress. The temperature inside the environmental chamber represents the ambient temperature for the LED and thus by gradually increasing the ambient temperature the T-point temperature is also increased. The temperature of the chamber and the T-point are measured by using k-type thermocouple. The corresponding data hence obtained are tabulated and correlated with light output. The results are analysed using statistical tool to obtain the relation between the parameters. Â© 2016, LLC Editorial of Journal â€œLight Technikâ€.

In the third world country like India because of cost effectiveness CFLs are still used without any power factor correction circuitry. Recently the power factor improvement tool is made compulsive for CFL and the recommended range as suggested by IEC 61000-3-2 is greater than 0.85. In addition to this the current harmonic distortion is preferred to be around 30% as per the standards. But unfortunately there are still CFLs available in the market which have less power factor in comparison with the desired standards. This has caused substantial problems not only on the generation side, but it certainly has considerable impact on the lamp performance. In the present work in order to exemplify this problem, four CFLs of 15W each from two different manufacturers are used for the experiment. Out of these four lamps, two lamps are ballast with low input power factor and instant start type. The other two are incorporated with improved input power factor having rapid start or warm start circuitry. The lamps are constantly switched ON and OFF at regular intervals. The interval was taken as 5 minutes ON and 5 minutes OFF. The lamps were subjected to this accelerated switching test. At the end of every switching cycle the electrode temperature was calculated from the ratio of hot resistance to cold resistance. It was thus observed that lamps with instant start ballast and poor power factor were unable to sustain the switching stress as compared to the lamps with rapid start ballast and improved power factor. Furthermore, the rise in electrode temperature for the lamps with improved power factor was within the desired standards. Thus it was concluded that lamps with poor power factor was more prone to early end in comparison with the other variety.

Motivated by novel applications in electro-conductive microchannel transport systems, the current article investigates analytically the electromagnetic pumping of non-Newtonian aqueous electrolytes via peristaltic waves in a two-dimensional microchannel with different peristaltic waves propagating at the upper and lower channel wall (complex wavy scenario). The Stokes couple stress model is deployed to capture micro-structural characteristics of real working fluids. The unsteady two-dimensional conservation equations for mass and momentum conservation, electro-kinetic and magnetic body forces, are formulated in two dimensional Cartesian co-ordinates.

The Poisson-Boltzmann equation for electric potential distribution is implemented owing to the presence of an electrical double layer (EDL) in the micro-channel. Using long wavelength, lubrication theory and Debye-Huckel approximations, the linearized transformed dimensionless boundary value problem is solved analytically. The influence of electro-osmotic parameter (inversely proportional to Debye length), maximum electro-osmotic velocity (a function of external applied electrical field) and couple stress parameter on axial velocity, volumetric flow rate, pressure gradient, local wall shear stress and stream function distributions is evaluated in detail with the aid of graphs. The Newtonian fluid case is retrieved as a special case with vanishing couple stress effects. With increasing the couple stress parameter there is a significant increase in the axial pressure gradient whereas the core axial velocity is reduced. An increase in the electro-osmotic parameter both induces flow acceleration in the core region (around the channel centreline) and it also enhances the axial pressure gradient substantially.

Handling electrolytes in typical peristaltic channel material such as polyvinyl chloride and Teflon leads to the generation of a net surface charge on the channel walls, which attracts counter-ions and repels co-ions from the aqueous solution, thus leading to the formation of an electrical double layer-a region of net charges near the wall. We analyze the spatial distribution of pressure and wall shear stress for a continuous wave train and single pulse peristaltic wave in the presence of an electrical (electroosmotic) body force, which acts on the net charges in the electrical double layer. We then analyze the effect of the electroosmotic body force on the particle reflux as elucidated through the net displacement of neutrally buoyant particles in the flow as the peristaltic waves progress. The impact of combined electroosmosis and peristalsis on trapping of a fluid volume (e.g., bolus) inside the travelling wave is also discussed. The present analysis goes beyond the traditional analysis, which neglects the possibility of coupling the net pumping of fluids due to peristalsis and allows us to derive general expressions for the pressure drop and flow rate in order to set up a general framework for incorporating flow control and actuation by simultaneous peristalsis and application of electric fields to aqueous solutions.

The improvement in overall light extraction efficiency for the LEDs having rectangular and hexagonal patterning in free surfaces have been estimated around 2.25 and 3.39 times of that of the LED structure with smooth free surface (i.e., without any patterning), respectively.

However, multimedia applications also require provisioning of adequate quality of service (QoS) to enhance quality of experience (QoE) of end users. In order to provide QoS in a network, the accurate knowledge of the remaining network resources at any time is the key. But, due to the inherent characteristics of MANETs such as dynamic topology, high bit-error-rate communication channels, and decentralized control, estimating remaining network resources is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel remaining bandwidth estimation algorithm which considers the node (or link) mobility into consideration while performing dynamic bandwidth estimation on a node. The estimated link bandwidth value is then used during the route discovery process to select routes with adequate bandwidth and thus increases the QoS of the data flow. The proposed algorithm is verified using real-time video traffic (i.e., H.264/SVC encoded video traces) using a industry standard simulator called Qualnet. The simulation results show that the proposed approach increases the decision accuracy of the soft admission control process and thus leads to the enhancement of the quality of the received video traffic.

In silico models assumed normal strain as the stimulus to predict the sites of new bone formation. These models, however, may fail to fit the amount of newly formed bone. Loading parameters such as strain, frequency, and loading cycle decide the amount of new bone formation. The models did not incorporate this information. In fact, there is no unifying relationship to quantify the amount of new bone formation as a function of loading parameters. Therefore, the present work aims to establish an empirical relationship between loading parameters and a new bone formation parameter i.e. mineral apposition rate (MAR). A neural network model is used to serve the purpose. Loading parameters are supplied as input, whereas, MAR served as output. The model is trained and tested with experimental data. The model establishes an empirical relationship to estimate MAR as a function of loading parameters. The models predictions of MAR align with in vivo experimental results. The models response is analyzed which indicates that the bone adaptation characteristics are successfully captured in the relationship. The relationship established may be incorporated further to improve qualitative and quantitative prediction capabilities of computer models. These findings can be extended in future to design and develop effective biomechanical strategies such as prophylactic exercise to cure bone loss.

While most such studies have been conducted on constant speed stationary engines and modern engines, this study tried to analyze the effectiveness of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system on a Euro-1, water-cooled, direct injection, variable speed, compression ignition (C.I.) engine in a laboratory setup in India. This was done by testing an electronic control unit (ECU)-controlled EGR valve running the engine on different speeds; with different torques, as also with varying EGR percentages. Then optimum value of EGR valve opening for each set of engine speed and torque was determined, that is, corresponding to minimum oxides of nitrogen (NOx). Optimum EGR valve position was programmatically fed, for each set of torque and engine speed (in RPM), into EGR ECU and then the engine was run at varying speeds and torques and the emissions were verified in the automated mode. It was found that using EGR, NOx emissions were substantially reduced (average 45% reduction), without significantly impacting the engine performance. However, smoke emission increased with EGR. In order to counter the adverse effects, additional emission reduction technologies should be used in tandem with EGR.

A gear pair in action is generally subjected to contact loading at the mating surface. In this paper, the stresses due to contact loading have been evaluated on the surface of gear tooth and along the gear tooth depth. The spur gear was considered for this study for two different loading conditions, torques of 150 Nm and 200 Nm. The involute profile of the spur gear was generated using an ANSYS APDL program prior to spur gear model development. The finite element analysis was carried out using ANSYS 15. The Finite Element Method (FEM) was comparatively an easy and accurate technique for analysing the nonlinear gear contact stresses. Frictional coefficients ranging from 0.0 until 0.3 were selected and the corresponding contact stresses were found to be directly proportional to the friction coefficients. A governing equation for the relationship between the dimensionless contact stress values and gear tooth depth ratios for varying friction coefficients was established. The results showed that the maximum stress was located beneath the surface of the gear tooth in contact for low friction coefficient values, Î¼ < 0.23. The stress trend remains the same for Î¼ > 0.23 but the surface stress becomes greater than the stresses beneath the surface. Furthermore, the position of maximum stress along the depth of contact was unchanged regardless of the amount of torque applied and frictional coefficient values.

The effects of power law index and viscosities on pressure across one wavelength, mechanical efficiency, and trapping are discussed numerically. It is found that the pressure required to restrain flowrates and the mechanical efficiency increase with the viscosities of the intermediate and peripheral layers as well as with the flow behaviour index.

The sector provides strong incentives for vertical integration due to economies of scope. However, it is evident from the literature that large integrated PPPs in railway systems are not feasible due to higher commercial risks. They also suffer from implicit cross subsidization since the railway infrastructure is capital intensive, common to multiple revenue sources, and fare box revenues are generally not sufficient to recover investments. This is being addressed by various unbundling approaches in recent PPPs. The common unbundling is between infrastructure, operations, and services.The objective of this research is to explore the potential of unbundling further and to come up with a framework that helps policy makers in taking macro level decisions on PPP structuring. The research disaggregates the railway system into over 40 elements wherein an element is the smallest unit that can be given to a party for execution. However this unbundling would result in significant horizontal and vertical interfaces between these elements.A sustainable PPP would need to limit the extent of interfaces due to transaction costs and risks. This can be achieved by bundling the elements horizontally and/or vertically into entities to extract the best value for a PPP. The governing principles would be scale economies (horizontal integration), scope economies (vertical integration), need for competition (horizontal disaggregation), level playing field, transactional transparency, and need for specialization (vertical disaggregation). Additional drivers would be appetite for investment, availability of competence and accountability for an entity. The findings of the research indicate that the entity formation is one of the most crucial aspects of a PPP in railways.A consequential critical area is managing the interfaces between entities, which are subject to transaction costs and risks. These should be carefully identified and addressed by well-designed contractual agreements and independent regulation.

The present investigation uses the same tool as a device for detoxifying asbestos, a potent carcinogenic entity; with fungal isolates native to the asbestos mines of Rajasthan, India, being investigated for the first time. The cellular mechanism of asbestos toxicity is mainly attributed to the presence of iron in its chemical composition which catalyzes generation of free radicals leading to oxidation of biomolecules. The two dominant novel species found therein, identified as Aspergillus tubingenesis and Coemansia reversa have proved capable of actively removing iron from asbestos fibers as studied by scanning electron microscopy- electron diffraction X-ray (SEM-EDX) analysis. This probably could lead to a reduction in toxicity of asbestos, due to reduced iron concentration as reported in related studies. Many fungi are known to release iron chelating compounds, siderophores, which could be instrumental in the study. The findings related to two new fungal species being added to the list of earlier identified fungal bioremediators of asbestos, widens the prospect of using bioremediation as an effective tool for asbestos detoxification.

In other words, it gives a linearized order of graph nodes describing the relationship between the graph vertices. Many applications of various fields in computer science require a constraint-based ordering of tasks and, thus, topological sorting holds a big place of importance for many applications like semantic analysis in compiler design, Gantt chart generation in software project management and many more. In this paper, a parallel version of this ordering algorithm over CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) has been discussed by identifying an approach to process-independent portions of the graph simultaneously for load flow analysis over radial distribution networks. The serial implementation of topological sort has been first discussed followed by its implementation on thread-block architecture of CUDA modifying the serial algorithm. Finally, the efficiency of this parallel version of topo sort has been investigated on various structures of graph modeled from radial distribution networks and has been reported.

Furthermore, Au alloys constitute an important model system in the context of corrosion, dealloying, and stress corrosion cracking. Adsorbed self-assembled monolayers of thiol molecules inhibit the dealloying reaction. On thiol-modified Cu-Au alloys dealloying finally proceeds in a localized reaction instead of a homogeneous process. Using ethanethiols as an example, we show here that thiols can be effectively removed by application of anodic oxidation. Homogeneous porosity forms then after an oxidation step. In-situ X-ray diffraction and crystal truncation rod analysis of ethanethiol-modified Au (001) confirms that a bare Au surface is recovered after a similar oxidation step. In consequence, a multi-step dealloying process including complete initial thiol-layers as well as partially or fully re-cleaned surfaces can produce different micro-cracks, providing larger scale openings, and homogeneous nanoporous Au in between. Such hierarchically structured surfaces may show superior applicability for reactions where mass transport into the porous layer plays a decisive role for the reaction rate or detection probability.

To construct the filter, first initialize all filter parameters and to overcome the wrap around effect, first calculate the sine and cosine differences along with angular distance. When the filter is constructed, do the convolution with FFT of input noisy image. The resultant enhanced image attained PSNR and MAE (Mean Absolute Error) 7.9230, 101.728 dB, respectively.

For this purpose, a genetically-engineered myoglobin (Mb) mutant was created by incorporating redox-active 3-amino-L-tyrosine (NH2Tyr) into its active site, replacing the distal histidine (H64) with NH2Tyr. In peroxide-shunt assays, this variant exhibits an increased rate of turnover for thioanisole and benzaldehyde oxidation as compared to the wild-type (WT) Mb. Indeed, in the presence of excess hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a 9-fold and 81-fold increase in activity was observed over multiple turnovers for thioanisole sulfoxidation and benzoic acid formation, respectively. The increased oxidation activity in the H64NH2Tyr Mb mutant underlined the role of NH2Tyr in the distal active-site scaffold in peroxide activation. Kinetic, electrochemical, and EPR spectroscopic experiments were performed. On the basis of these studies, it is argued that the single NH2Tyr residue within the Mb variant simultaneously serves the role of the conserved His/Arg-pair within the distal pocket of horseradish peroxidase.

In this paper, we propose a reactive Link Stability Based Routing (LSBR) protocol. LSBR discover route consisting of links having high lifetime. The stability of a link is estimated dynamically during the route dis covery process using its signal strength and interference along with the relative mobility of nodes forming the link. A multi-metric mathematical model has been developed using the aforementioned parameters to select a link from the candidate links at each intermediate node in such a way that leads to selection of high lifetime route. To prove effectiveness of LSBR protocol for real-life video streaming, a hybrid MANET scenario consisted of simulated nodes and physical machines is designed using an industry standard emulation tool called EXata-Cyber. Correctness of LSBR protocol for video streaming is established by simulation, hybrid testbed as well as usersâ€™ experience.

In silico models assumed normal strain or strain energy density (SED) as the stimulus to predict loading-induced osteogenesis, however, these models may have limited success in fitting the in vivo new bone formation at several instances. For example, rest-inserted cyclic loading amplifies the new bone formation as compared to continuous-cyclic loading even though similar strain magnitude were induced in both the cases. It is also believed that loading-induced interstitial fluid flow can also be a potential stimulus of osteogenesis. The present study hypothesizes that fluid motion as osteogenic stimulus may explain the afore-mentioned anomalies. Accordingly, this work studies osteogenesis as functions of SED and canalicular fluid motion using an in silico model. Therefore, the new bone formation is considered roughly proportional to stimuli above their osteogenic thresholds. This model attempts to simulate in vivo new bone formation noticed in rest-inserted cantilever loading studies. The models prediction of site-specific new bone formation improves when fluid flow is considered as the stimulus. It is also noticed that fluid motion as the stimulus closely fits the new bone formation for another in vivo study where the effects of aging on osteogenesis were examined. These attempts to establish fluid flow as a potential osteogenic stimulus can be useful in the prediction of site-specific new bone formation. The findings will ultimately be useful in designing biomechanical interventions such as prophylactic exercises to cure bone loss.

It endeavours to place the film both as text and cinematic work into a broader perspective based on the study of intertextuality of three renditions: Raghavaiahs Devdas (Telugu, 1953), Bimal Roys Devdas (Hindi, 1955) and Bhansalis Devdas (Hindi, 2002). Grounded in cultural theory and Indian performative aesthetics coupled with moving image analysis, this study highlights the underlying, deep-rooted romanticism embedded in Indian philosophical and aesthetic traditions of devotion between atma (individual soul) and paramatma (absolute soul), personifying Paro/Chandramukhi as atma and Devdas as paramatma. This article, part of a larger project on de-Westernising media studies, makes a critical intervention in current South Asian Studies by aiming to provide a novel theoretical framework to which the philosophical and traditional tenets grounding the novella of Devdas can be anchored.

One such technique, for opening of energy gap in graphene, is by way of doping the pristine graphene with boron or nitrogen. Besides many important applications, to which B- and N-doped graphene has been put, the one very important for solving the global energy crisis is by way of its capacity for hydrogen storage. In this paper electronic structure of B- and N-doped graphene has been studied by using Density Functional Theory, as implemented in WIEN2K code. PBE-GGA (Perdewâ€“Burkeâ€“Ernzerhof 96) pseudo-potential is used for solving the Schrodinger equation in self-consistent manner and to account for the exchange and correlation effects through the use of Generalized Gradient Approximation. The band structure calculations reveal that whereas a band gap opens at the symmetry point K both for B- and N-doped graphene, the center of the gap (i.e., the Dirac point in pristine graphene) is shifted above the Fermi level by about 2.20Â eV for B-doped graphene, and shifted down the Fermi level by about the same amount for N-doped graphene, when the doping level was kept 25% in each case. The energy gap opened was found to be about 0.30Â eV for B-doped graphene and 0.45Â eV for N-doped graphene. The linear dispersion characteristics obtained at Dirac point for pristine graphene, almost vanish for B-/N-doped graphene, due to symmetry breaking and opening of energy gap. The band structure and Density of States of B-/N-doped graphene are found also to depend on the choice of cell parameters.

In reality different land covers within a pixel can be found due to continuum of variation in landscape and intrinsic mixed nature of most classes. Mixed pixels may not be appropriately processed by traditional image classifiers, which assume that pixels are pure. The existence of mixed pixels led to the development of several approaches for soft (often termed fuzzy in the remote sensing literature) classification in which each pixel is allocated to all classes in varying proportions. However, while the proportions of each land cover within each pixel may be predicted, the spatial location of each land cover within each pixel is not.

In this paper, we introduce a new ranking algorithm that computes the rank of a task, based on its successor rank and its predecessors average communication time, instead of its successors rank. The advantage of this ranking algorithm is that two dependent tasks are assigned to the same machine and as a result the scheduled length is reduced. The task selection phase selects a ready task from each workflow and creates a task pool. The resource selection phase initially assigns tasks using min-min heuristic, after initial assignment, tasks are moved from the highly loaded machines to the lightly loaded machines. Our resource selection algorithm increases the load balance among the resources due to tasks assignment heuristic and reassignment of tasks from the highly loaded machines. The simulation results show that our proposed scheduling algorithm performs better over existing approaches in terms of load balance, makespan and turnaround time. Â© 2018 Slovak Academy of Sciences.

The cilia are arranged at equal intervals and protrude normally from both walls of the infinitely long channel. A metachronal wave is generated due to natural beating of cilia and the direction of wave propagation is parallel to the direction of fluid flow. Appropriate expressions are presented for deformation via longitudinal and transverse velocity components induced by the ciliary beating phenomenon with cilia assumed to follow elliptic trajectories. The conservation equations for mass, longitudinal and transverse (linear) momentum and angular momentum are reduced in accordance with the long wavelength and creeping Stokesian flow approximations and then normalized with appropriate transformations. The resulting non-linear moving boundary value problem is solved analytically for constant micro-inertia density, subject to physically realistic boundary conditions. Closed-form expressions are derived for axial velocity, angular velocity, volumetric flow rate and pressure rise. The transport phenomena are shown to be dictated by several non-Newtonian parameters, including micropolar material parameter and Eringen coupling parameter, and also several geometric parameters, viz eccentricity parameter, wave number and cilia length. The influence of these parameters on streamline profiles (with a view to addressing trapping features via bolus formation and evolution), pressure gradient and other characteristics are evaluated graphically. Both axial and angular velocities are observed to be substantially modified with both micropolar rheological parameters and furthermore are significantly altered with increasing volumetric flow rate. Free pumping is also examined. An inverse relationship between pressure rise and flow rate is computed which is similar to that observed in Newtonian fluids.

Recent advancements in nanotechnology-based medicines have opened new horizons for combating multidrug resistance in microorganisms. In particular, the use of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) as a potent antibacterial agent has received much attention. The most critical physico-chemical parameters that affect the antimicrobial potential of AgNPs include size, shape, surface charge, concentration and colloidal state. AgNPs exhibits their antimicrobial potential through multifaceted mechanisms. AgNPs adhesion to microbial cells, penetration inside the cells, ROS and free radical generation, and modulation of microbial signal transduction pathways have been recognized as the most prominent modes of antimicrobial action. On the other side, AgNPs exposure to human cells induces cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, and inflammatory response in human cells in a cell-type dependent manner. This has raised concerns regarding use of AgNPs in therapeutics and drug delivery. We have summarized the emerging endeavors that address current challenges in relation to safe use of AgNPs in therapeutics and drug delivery platforms. Based on research done so far, we believe that AgNPs can be engineered so as to increase their efficacy, stability, specificity, biosafety and biocompatibility. In this regard, three perspectives research directions have been suggested that include (1) synthesizing AgNPs with controlled physico-chemical properties, (2) examining microbial development of resistance toward AgNPs, and (3) ascertaining the susceptibility of cytoxicity, genotoxicity, and inflammatory response to human cells upon AgNPs exposure.

Furthermore a comparative study for different nanoparticle geometries (i.e. bricks, platelets and cylinders) is conducted. The computations show that pressure increases with enhancing the heat absorption, buoyancy force (i.e. Grashof number) and nanoparticle fraction however it reduces with increasing the magnetic field.

A comparative study is also made with Newtonian fluids (corresponding to massive values of plastic viscosity). Stream lines are plotted to visualize trapping phenomenon. The computations reveal that velocity increases with increasing the magnitude of Hartmann number near the channel walls whereas in the core flow region (center of the channel) significant deceleration is observed. Temperature is elevated with greater Casson parameter, Hartmann number, velocity slip, eccentricity parameter, thermal slip and also Brinkmann (dissipation) number. Furthermore greater Casson parameter is found to elevate the quantity and size of the trapped bolus. In the pumping region, the pressure rise is reduced with greater Hartmann number, velocity slip, and wave number whereas it is enhanced with greater cilia length.

The Jeffrey viscoelastic model is utilized which features both relaxation and retardation terms of relevance to real polymers. A magnetic body force is incorporated for the influence of static radial magnetic field. The mass and momentum conservation equations are formulated in an intrinsic coordinate system and transformed with appropriate variables into a nondimensional system between the wave and the laboratory frames, under lubrication (i.e., low Reynolds number and long wavelength) approximations. Kinematic and no-slip boundary conditions are imposed at the channel walls. A magnetic body force is incorporated for the influence of static radial magnetic field in the primary momentum equation. An analytic approach is employed to determine closed-form solutions for stream function, axial pressure gradient, and volumetric flow rate. Spatiotemporal plots for pressure distribution along the channel (passage) length are presented to study the influences of curvature parameter, relaxation-to-retardation time ratio (Jeffrey first viscoelastic parameter) and Hartmann number (magnetic field parameter). The effects of these parameters on radial velocity distributions are also visualized. Cases of trapping and reflux in a curved channel are discussed. Streamline distributions are included to study trapping phenomena and to investigate more closely the impact of curvature, magnetic field, and viscoelastic properties on bolus evolution. The reflux or retrograde motion of the particles is studied by particle advection based on Lagrangian viewpoint.

Ball-end milling experiments have been planned using central composite design based on response surface methodology. The mathematical models have been established and tested for adequacy. A full quadratic model has been adopted for modelling. It has been found that axial depth of cut is the most dominant cutting parameter for the tangential and axial cutting forces, accounting for 49.38 and 47.12% contributions, respectively. Radial depth of cut is the most dominant parameter for radial force and contributes 69.94% for it. Results also revealed that force components decrease with increase in cutting speed. There is very small variation in cutting force components in the cutting speed range of 75â€“150Â m/min at lower values of axial and radial depth of cut. Surface roughness is effected by cutting speed largely followed by feed. Multi-objective optimization has been performed using composite desirability to optimize the cutting parameters for minimum surface roughness and cutting forces simultaneously.

The crystallinity, bonding behavior and disorder in the films were investigated with X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), UVâ€“visible and ellipsometry techniques, while surface morphology was studied using Atomic force microscopy (AFM). The nanocrystalline nature of PMMA is seen to be preserved in the blends although there are clear indications of bond modifications. The addition of PCTFE results in the improvement of overall crystallinity of the films via the interaction among PMMA and degraded PCTFE molecules when the films are casted from diluted solutions. In agreement, corresponding disorder in terms of Urbach energy shows a decreasing trend upon inclusion of more and more PCTFE molecules. Micro-Raman spectra are dominated by fluorescence background, which is proposed as arising from degraded PCTFE. Supporting this, FTIR spectra also shows modifications in bonding as a function of PCTFE percentage, but this bond modification is not enough to produce refractive index variation in the sample, which is dominated by the host PMMA contribution for all the PCTFE concentrations. The study suggests the useful range of PCTFE concentration in which PMMA host properties can be modified for optimizing optical and structural properties without much degradation of PCTFE.

It is observed that with an increment in the Grashof number the velocity of the governing fluids starts to decrease significantly and the pressure gradient is higher for pure water as compared to single-walled carbon nanotubes due to low density. As the specific heat is very high for pure water as compared to the multi-wall carbon nanotubes, it raises temperature of the muscles, in the case of pure water, as compared to the multi-walled carbon nanotubes. Furthermore, it is noticed that the trapped bolus starts decreasing in size as the buoyancy forces are dominant as compared to viscous forces.

It is found that the viscous variation parameter enables to enhance the heat transfer rate. The Ti%6Al%4V alloy has higher friction factor coefficient along the azimuthal direction of the flow while Nimonic 80A alloy boosts up the friction coefficient along the tangential direction. It is worth to mention that the heat transfer rate of Nimonic 80A alloy is higher than that of Ti%6Al%4V alloy.

The multi-term general fractional diffusion equation containing force terms and a time dependent absorbent term is taken into account. Fractional calculus is applied to describe the phenomenon of sub-diffusion of oxygen in both transverse and longitudinal directions. A new computational algorithm, i.e., the new iterative method (NIM) is employed to solve the spatio-temporal fractional partial differential equation subject to appropriate physical boundary conditions. Validation of NIM solutions is achieved with a modified adomian decomposition method (MADM). A parametric study is conducted for three loading scenarios on the capillary-radial force alone, axial force alone and the combined case of both forces. The results demonstrate that the force terms markedly influence the oxygen diffusion process. For example, the radial force exerts a more profound effect than axial force on sub-diffusion of oxygen indicating that careful manipulation of these forces on capillary-tissues may assist in the effective reduction of hypoxia or other oxygen depletion phenomena.

More practical formulations are suggested while considering realities of modern distribution systems with reference to the stochastic nature of load demand and power generation among distribution buses on account of diversity, variability and uncertainty. The long-term costs in the proposed planning model include several techno-economic and social objectives pertaining to investment, operation and maintenance of these distributed resources and the revenue generated by sale of electricity to customers and the utility grid. The proposed planning model is more practical as it fully considers the system uncertainties and variability in load and power generation which are efficiently handled by introducing deterministic self-adaptive uncertainty model.

The siting and sizing of DG is carried out to improve the overall voltage profile or/and reduction in active power loss using two stage Genetic Algorithm (GA). In the first stage a basic knockout selection is considered and the best population is taken for next stage, where roulette selection for crossover and mutation is performed for optimal placement and sizing of DGs.

The desired magnetic nanocaps composed of CoO/Co bilayer film on these patterned substrates were prepared by molecular beam epitaxy technique under ultra-high vacuum conditions. For this, a Co layer of ~10 nm thickness was deposited on the substrates and then oxidized in-situ to form CoO/Co/PS in-situ oxidized film or ex-situ in ambiance which also gives CoO/Co/PS naturally oxidized film. Simultaneously, reference thin films of Co (~10 nm) were also prepared on plane Si substrate and similar oxidation treatments were performed on them respectively. The magnetic properties studied using SQUID technique revealed higher exchange bias (~1736 Oe) in the in-situ oxidized Co/PS film as compared to that in naturally oxidized Co/PS film (~1544 Oe) and also compared to the reference film.

This approach has been tested for 33-nodes as well as for 69-nodes radial distribution systems and comparison has been done between the performances of sequential approach over CPU and parallel approach on GPU. The results show that introducing CUDA to load flow analysis speeds up the performance of the system by faster executions and gives accurate desired results as compared to sequential approach.

Genetic Algorithm based solutions emerged as the most popular tool to solve this which is a heuristic mechanism to find the closest approximate solution to the problem. In this paper, we approach Travelling Salesman Problem using GA approach, a natural selection technique which repeatedly modifies a population of individual solutions, with the added power of modern computing systems. Here we come up with a parallel version of GA for both multicore and many core architectures over OpenMP and CUDA in order to make some of the challenging problems like Vehicle Routing Problem for google maps, DNA sequencing and many more optimization problems involving a good amount of complex computation and data handling.

The work done in this paper provides information about the filament current crest factor with corresponding change in electrode temperature. The lamps used for these experiment are switched on and off with sufficient time given to cool the lamp electrodes. The degradation of the lamp life with respect to filament current crest factor and electrode temperature are plotted and analysed. The best fit is obtained for the set of experiments conducted.

India is presently producing approximately 190 million tons of fly ash every year from moreover 145 power plants. Present research is focused on the different parameters which are curing temperature, ratio of sodium silicate to sodium hydroxide, molarity of sodium hydroxide, curing type and the results have been studied and discussed. Previous works emphasis that only the use of fly ash as the base material confine the concrete to be heat cured which limits the applicability of geopolymer concrete to cast-in-situ conditions. So some proportion of flyash is replaced by ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) and the effect on compressive and tensile strength is observed. Ambient temperature dry curing was done without any water when some proportion of fly ash was replaced by GGBFS. The ratio of sodium silicate solution to sodium hydroxide solution by mass was kept fixed at 2.5 and the concentration of sodium hydroxide was kept 14M. The ratio of flyash to alkali solution was kept 0.35 & 0.40. Replacing 40% of Flyash by GGBFS and keeping the concentration of NaOH as 14M at ambient temperature, the compressive strength encountered was 40 MPa.

The developed source has simultaneous diagnostics facility using Langmuir probe and optical emission spectroscopy. The two anode configurations, namely, double ring and rectangular configurations, have been studied and compared for optimum use of the geometry for efficient light emissions and recording. The plasma is produced using helium gas and admixture of three noble gases including helium, neon, and argon. The source is capable to produce eight spectral lines for pure helium in the VUV range from 20 to 60 nm and total 24 spectral lines covering the wavelength range 20â€“106 nm for the admixture of gases. The large range of VUV lines is generated from gaseous admixture rather from the sputtered materials. The recorded spectrum shows that the plasma light radiations in both visible and VUV range are larger in double ring configuration than that of the rectangular configurations at the same discharge operating conditions. To clearly understand the difference, the imaging of the discharge using ICCD camera and particle-in-cell simulation using VORPAL have also been carried out. The effect of ion diffusion, metastable collision with the anode wall and the nonlinear effects are correlated to explain the results.

The prompt upsurge of the Indian population will force people to migrate from the rural area to the mega cities, to avail basic amenities. The enormous migration will increase the demand for more space to live in mega cities and will lead to a situation of unauthorized, unplanned, uncoordinated, and uncontrolled growth, and this condition called as urban sprawl.

The present study has been designed to utilize plant pathogenic fungi Sclerotinia sclerotiorum MTCC 8785 strain for synthesis and optimization of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) production as well as evaluation of antibacterial properties. The AgNPs were synthesized by reduction of aqueous silver nitrate (AgNO3) solution after incubation of 3â€“5Â days at room temperature. The AgNPs were further characterized using UVâ€“visible spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Reaction parameters including media, fungal biomass, AgNO3 concentration, pH and temperature were further optimized for rapid AgNPs production. The antibacterial efficacy of AgNPs was evaluated against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 by disc diffusion and growth kinetics assay at the concentration determined by the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Results: AgNPs synthesis was initially marked by the change in colour from pale white to brown and was confirmed by UVâ€“Vis spectroscopy. Optimization studies showed that potato dextrose broth (PDB) media, 10Â g of biomass, addition of 2Â mM AgNO3, pH 11 and 80Â Â°C temperature resulted in enhanced AgNPs synthesis through extracellular route. TEM data revealed spherical shape AgNPs with size in the range of 10Â nm. Presence of proteins capped to AgNPs was confirmed by FTIR. AgNPs showed antibacterial activity against E. coli and S. aureus at 100Â ppm concentration, corresponding MIC value. Conclusion: S. sclerotiorum MTCC 8785 mediated AgNPs was synthesized rapidly under optimized conditions, which showed antibacterial activity.

For this purpose, a reliability model is proposed by considering independent h/w and s/w failure. Initially, one unit is operative and another is kept as spare in cold standby. A single server is provided to conduct preventive maintenance, repair, replacement and up-gradation of the components upon their failure. Then, a maximum operation time system undergoes preventive maintenance, directly from normal mode. If the repair of the h/w is not possible by the server up to a pre-specific time, it is replaced by a new one with some replacement time. However, only up-gradation of the software by a new one is made whenever s/w fails to execute the desired function properly. Priority to h/w repair is given over h/w replacement and s/w up-gradation. The failure time distribution of the h/w and s/w follows a negative exponential while the distributions of preventive maintenance, repair, up-gradation and replacement time are taken as arbitrary with different probability density functions. To depict the importance of the study, graphs are drawn for a particular case with fixed values of other parameters and costs.

These uncertainties present in a reliability model can be handled well if the probabilistic constraints of such models are satisfied. This paper is directed to handle these probabilistic constraints of a reliability-based design optimization model (RBDO). For this purpose, one of the most efficient and precise optimization tools, namely genetic algorithm (GA), has been used. The basic principle of GAs involves the combination of the fittest string structures which are generated through numerous random iterations. The main objective of this paper is to incorporate the efficient function of a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) in a code formulated in â€˜Câ€™ language which is designed in a manner such that it is capable to handle the probabilistic constraints of a RBDO model.

Threshold mechanism is effective to manage the load among VMs. Previous research shows thrashing is a good option to manage load and migrate the load among VMs during failover and high load.

Outcome of present computations are compared with available results and a reasonable agreement is recorded.

Optical absorption spectra investigations performed here, in the energy range from 3 to 5 eV confirms effective utilization of these compounds in solar cells and other optoelectronic applications. In addition, the transport properties computations performed using semi-classical Boltzmann theory, shows constant pattern of thermo power near ambient temperature range (200â€“500 K), which admits possible utilization of these compounds as low temperature thermoelectric materials. Performed ZT calculations demonstrates reasonably good thermoelectric performance for both materials, as there exist minor variation (0.1) in the values over wide temperature ranges i.e. from 100 to 800 K.

In the Young scheme (2013), a secret image is subdivided into n non-overlapped image sections. When L (2 â‰¤ L â‰¤ n) participants stack their shadow images, all the image sections associated with these L participants will be recovered. In this article, the scheme suggested for a block based progressive scheme is critically analyzed and we show that leakage of secret information is possible in the scheme during the encoding process of the shares. Further, we propose a new robust progressive algorithm based on the logistic chaotic map to overcome the said limitation. The irregular outputs of the logistic map are used to encode a secret digital image. To provide robustness during the encoding process of the share, noise has been introduced along with chaotic sequences.

Sampling was carried out during pre-monsoon (March), early-monsoon (June), monsoon (September) and post-monsoon (December) seasons. Low- and high-frequency magnetic susceptibility (Ï‡lf and Ï‡hf), frequency-dependent magnetic susceptibility (Ï‡fd), Ï‡fd %, isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM), â€œhardâ€ IRM (HIRM), saturation IRM (SIRM) and inter-parametric ratios were determined for the samples. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used on limited number of samples. NOAA HYSPLIT MODEL backward trajectory analysis and principal component analysis were carried out on the data. Fly ash samples exhibit an average HIRM value (400.07 Ã— 10âˆ’5Â Am2Â kgâˆ’1) that is comparable to that of soil samples. The pre- and post-monsoon samples show a consistent reduction in the concentration of magnetically â€œhardâ€ minerals with increasing distance from the power plant. These data suggest that fly ash has indeed been transported from the power plant to the sampling locations. Hence, HIRM may perhaps be used as a proxy for tracking fly ash from coal-fired thermal power plants. Seasonal data show that the distribution of fly ash to the surrounding areas is minimum during monsoons. They also point to the dominance of SP magnetite in early-monsoon season, whereas magnetic depletion is documented in the monsoon season. This seasonal difference is attributable to both pedogenesis and anthropogenic activity i.e. operation of the thermal power plant.

If we analyze the financial inclusion, we will found that achieving the financial inclusion is based on two pillars - demand side and supply side. Where availability of the financial products in the market is very important, equally important is the fact that people are aware of them and they are in a situation to demand those products. In this context, financial literacy among the masses is very important, so that people have the awareness about the financial climate and financial products. This will increase their capability to demand for the financial products. This way, it can achieve the target of financial inclusion. Research Methodology: The research work is based on the secondary data. These data are obtained fromRBI publications, research papers and text books. It also uses secondary data from various other sources- newspapers, journals and periodicals like Economic Times, Business Line, Micro-Finance world etc. The study is designed as follows: In section-1 we introduce the concept of financial inclusion. An attempt is made to understand meaning, role and importance of financial inclusion. Section-2 will describe the link between financial inclusion and financial literacy and the various facets of it. In section-3 we provide our conclusions and some suggestions. Findings: Financial inclusion is an attempt to achieve the ultimate objective i.e. inclusive growth. Financial inclusion is an important constituent of this, because a financially deprivement is a very big deterrent of a persons overall development. Our study reveals that the final answer of financial inclusion rests on both sides-demand side and supply side. It is now, becoming increasingly apparent that addressing the problem of financial exclusion will require a holistic approach in creating awareness about not only on credit management but on financial products, education, debt counseling, savings and advice on money management.

This decoupling provides several advantages such as flexibility, programmability, and centralized control. However, SDN also introduces new vulnerabilities due to the required communication between data plane and control plane. Examples of threats that leverage such vulnerabilities are the control plane saturation and switch buffer overflow attacks. These attacks can be launched by flooding the TCP SYN packets from data plane (i.e., switches) to the control plane. This paper presents SAFETY, a novel solution for the early detection and mitigation of TCP SYN flooding. SAFETY harnesses the programming and wide visibility approach of SDN with entropy method to determine the randomness of the flow data. The entropy information includes destination IP and few attributes of TCP flags. To show the feasibility and effectiveness of SAFETY, we implement it as an extension module in Floodlight controller and evaluate it under different conditional scenarios. We run a thorough evaluation of our implementation through extensive emulation via Mininet. The experimental results show that when compared to the state-of-the-art, SAFETY brings a significant improvement (13 %) regarding processing delay experienced by a legitimate node. Other parameters such as CPU utilization at the controller and attack detection time are also examined and shows improvement in various scenarios.

Asbestos a naturally occurring fibrous mineral declared a Group I definite carcinogen by IARC (International Agency for Research on Cancer), a unit of WHO in the year 1987, has been extensively used since World War II to the near past for various commercial products. According to the most recent World Health Organization (WHO) estimates, asbestos-related diseases, resulting from exposure at workplace claims more than 107000 lives every year worldwide. The various types of toxic effects induced by asbestos in humans include - i) inflammation and fibrogenesis of lung, ii) mesothelioma iii) asbestosis and iv) bronchogenic carcinoma. The stability of asbestos in natural environment and its biological aggressiveness is related to their fibrous structure and dimensions. The actual risk associated with the exposure to nanosized asbestos, which is still unknown and escapes most regulations worldwide, has been shown in various toxicity assessment studies conducted on various animal models.In an effort to reduce the size of asbestos and therby its toxicity by limiting its biopersistence, oxalic acid treatment of asbestos coupled to power ultrasound treatment was carried out. The nanosized particles formed were still found to retain their hazardous effect. Similar were the results obtained on strong acid treatment of asbestos as well. A probable solution to the asbestos toxicity problem therefore envisaged was bioremediation. This involved the secretion of iron chelating molecules termed siderophores by microbes, which are of significance due to their ability to form very stable and soluble complexes with iron. Iron in asbestos composition is a major factor responsible for its carcinogenicity, removal or extraction of which would prove to be an effective answer to the worldwide problem. Siderophores are low molecular weight organic compounds with a very high and specific affinity to chelate iron and enhance their diffusion to the microbial cell surface. A number of successful experiments carried out in vitro have shown positive results concerning reduction in asbestos toxicity on chelation of iron by siderophores. The present investigation tends to put forth the aspect of these biomolecules secreted by specific bacteria and fungi as potent tools to fight the micro to nano sized asbestos fibre toxicity.

These oscillations occur far from conventional resonance and Floquet theory shows them to be unique to these systems. Of particular interest is the bulk topological insulator (TI) where the wave-vector dependent frequency of the ARO is seen to be gapped in topologically trivial situations and gapless when there is a non-vanishing Chern number. It is shown that the Chern number may be directly inferred by performing a pump-probe experiment in the bulk without referring to surface states. A simpler alternative to the Lindblad method is invoked in order to incorporate dephasing effects that despite leading to a non-unitary time evolution of the wave-function, is nevertheless, probability conserving. The differential transmission coefficient versus the pump pulse duration (when all else is held fixed) has the form of a sinusoidal function with an amplitude that decays as a power law in the pump duration (alternatively, the â€œareaâ€ of the pump pulse). The exponent of this power law decay is indicative of the Chern number of the bulk in case of TI and more generally indicative of the particular member of the family of materials that may be collectively referred to as â€“ Dirac-Weyl materials.

In general, rather than simply supported beam and diaphragm, microcantilever beams are widely preferred in BIO-MEMS and RF-MEMS for biosensing and RF switching, respectively. The lower level detection ability and simple structure make these cantilevers more applicable in many applications. The rectangular cantilever beams are most widely used in TG detection. but due to their constant or planner geometry and non-adhesion of analyte they are less sensitive in case of nano or pico level biosensing. This paper introduces the fractal surface geometry concept for increasing the deflection sensitivity corresponding to lower molecular or analyte loading. The rectangular and stepped cantilever beam structures along with fractal surface are simulated and analysed for TG molecular pressure 294.3 Pa. Both the rectangular and stepped microcantilever beams with fractal surface exhibit better free end or tip deflection (nearly 2Ã—) as compare to the planner surface based beam. The proposed fractal concept also reduces the actuation voltage requirement for perfect switching.

The server takes the unit under preventive maintenance after a maximum operation time at normal mode if one standby unit is available for operation. If the repair of the failed unit is not possible up to a maximum repair time, failed unit is replaced by new one. The failure time, maximum operation time and maximum repair time distributions of the unit are considered as exponentially distributed while repair and maintenance time distributions are considered as arbitrary.

With long wavelength, lubrication and Debye-HÃ¼ckel approximations, the boundary value problem is rendered non-dimensional. Analytical solutions are derived for the axial velocity, volumetric flow rate, pressure gradient, volumetric flow rate, averaged volumetric flow rate along one time period, pressure rise along one wavelength and stream function.

It also helps in framing alternate treatment plan. There are two different ways for identifying the side effects of drugs. First is premarketing trials, which are conducted before floating drugs into market. But this approach is not as effective as these trials are carried out on a restricted population for restricted time. That is why another approach called as postmarketing surveillance is used. Under this approach, data mining techniques have been applied frequently for finding adverse reactions of drugs. But most of the existing techniques are based on the assumption that all attributes are equally responsible for drug side effects which may not be applicable for all real-life cases.

The present concrete matrix gives only 10 to 12 percent of flexural strength as compared to its compressive strength. Human hair lasts for decades before finally decomposing and entering to Carbon and Nitrogen cycle. The waste human hair dumped in the streams chokes the streams and increases the environmental burden. In this experimental work, feasibility for enhancing the flexural strength of concrete with two-dimensional variation in human hair i.e., the length of hair fiber and its proportion in the concrete matrix, has been investigated.

The flow of current in arc-discharge method varies in the range 50â€“200Â A. Further arc-synthesized carbon nanotubes are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and the results are compared with nanotubes grown by chemical vapor deposition method. XRD result shows a characteristic peak (0 0 2) at 26.54Â° corresponding to the presence of carbon nanotubes. SEM and TEM results give morphology of as-synthesized multi-walled nanotubes. TEM results indicate synthesis of well-graphitized carbon nanotubes by arc-discharge method. Dispersion of arc-synthesized nanotubes in SDS solution under the effect of different sonication times is studied. Dispersion of nanotubes in SDS solution is analyzed using UVâ€“visâ€“NIR spectroscopy and it shows an absorption peak at 260Â nm. It was found that with the increase in sonication time, the absorption peak in UVâ€“visâ€“NIR spectra will increase and optimum sonication time was 2 hours.

The temperature dependence of the orbital moment has been deduced using Compton and magnetometry data ranging between 6 and 300 K. The present data exhibit a decrease in the ratio of orbital to spin moments from 43.9% to 35.0% (while going from 6 to 300 K). First-principles calculations within DFT + U scheme have also been performed to confirm the spin-, orbital- and site specific-magnetic moments in TbCo2. An antiparallel exchange coupling between the Tb-4f and Co spin moments is found. The orbital moment is found to have a parallel coupling with the Tb spin moment, as evident from the experimental MCPs. From first-principles data it is seen that the orbital moments of Tb and Co sites are antiparallel to each other, as in the case of their spin magnetic moments.

The surface of stretching sheet is considered as pervious. Buongiorno model associated with Brownian motion and thermophoretic diffusion is also employed. Well known similarity transformations are used to convert the governing equations into a set of ordinary differential equations. The transformed equations are then solved numerically using fourth order Runge-Kutta method. The effects of transverse magnetic field and permiability on dimensionless fluid velocity, fluid temperature, skin friction, Nusselt number and Sherwood number are examined. The numerical results accomplished in the present study are validated and felt to be in good agreement with the previously published results. The numerical computations reveal that that the Lorentz force due to presence of magnetic field impinges its resistance on fluid motion and enhances the thermal resistance. As a consequence, heat transfer rate from the sheet gets reduced in association with the porosity of the medium.

Three different layers i.e. the core layer, intermediate layer and peripheral layer are simulated with three different viscosities for each fluid layer. The unsteady two-dimensional conservation equations for mass and momentum with electrokinetic body forces, are transformed from the wave frame to the laboratory frame and the electrical field terms are rendered into electrical potential terms via the Poissonâ€“Boltzmann equation, Debye length approximation and ionic Nernstâ€“Planck equation. The dimensionless emerging linearized electrokinetic boundary value problem is solved using integral methods. Closed-form expressions are derived for stream functions in the core, intermediate and peripheral layers. Expressions are also derived for the coreâ€“intermediate interface shape and the intermediateâ€“peripheral interface shape. Maximum pressures are also computed. To study bolus migration, the range of the trapping limit is also determined in the peripheral layer. It is found that in the core layer larger boluses are computed in the case of lower intermediate layer viscosity relative to peripheral layer viscosity although the number of boluses is greater when the intermediate layer viscosity exceeds the peripheral layer viscosity. Furthermore, in the intermediate layer, stronger concentration of streamlines is computed in the lower half space with positive Helmholtzâ€“Smoluchowski velocity. Also negative Helmholtzâ€“Smoluchowski velocity reduces the core layer (H1) interface shape whereas it enhances the peripheral layer (H) and intermediate layer (H2) shapes. At lower values of volume flow rate ratio, hydromechanical efficiency is maximum for positive Helmholtzâ€“Smoluchowski velocity whether intermediate layer viscosity is less or greater than peripheral layer viscosity. Finally, greater with greater peristaltic wave amplitude and also for positive Helmholtzâ€“Smoluchowski velocity there is an increase in time-averaged flow rate, whether intermediate layer viscosity is less or greater than peripheral layer viscosity.

The most important factor in Aluminium production is the cost of energy used in the process of converting Aluminium oxide to Aluminium. This energy, which accounts for nearly 35% - 40% of the total cost of production of the metal, is primarily in the form of Direct Current (DC) power. DC Power is used in the process of electrolysis to convert Alumina (Aluminium Oxide) to Aluminium. With most of the production of electricity across the world is in the form of Alternating Current (AC) power, the process of conversion of this AC power to DC Power is critical. An efficient AC - DC converter becomes a critical component in the electrolytic reduction process of extracting non-ferrous metals in general and Aluminium in particular. The purpose of this research is to explore the reasons of mixed use of both the converter technologies, re-evaluate actual efficiency data on usage of both technologies and recommend the use of the more appropriate technology based on practical study.

India continues to be a key growth market among global corporates and this is reflective in the steady growth in demand for prime office space. A recent trend that has been noted is the increase in demand for office spaces not just in major cities but also in smaller tier II and Tier III cities. Growth in the commercial building sector projects a rising trend of energy intensive mechanical systems in office buildings in India. The air conditioning market in India is growing at 25% annually. This is due to the ever increasing demand to maintain thermal comfort in tropical regions. Air conditioning is one of the most energy intensive technologies which are used in buildings. As a result India is witnessing significant spike in energy demand and further widening the demand supply gap. Challenge in India is to identify passive measures in building envelope design in office buildings to reduce the cooling loads and conserve energy.

Biogeography basically is the study of the geographical distribution of the biological organism. Biogeography based optimization is a comparatively new approach. Mathematical models of biogeography explain how an organism arises and how to migrate from one habitat to another habitat, or get died out. In BBO algorithm, solutions are sharing the good features between solutions that are immigration and emigration process. This algorithm looks for the overall optimum solution mostly through two steps - Migration and Mutation.

The electrohydrodynamic (EHD) problem is also simplified under the Debye linearization. Closed-form solutions for the linearized dimensionless boundary value problem are derived. With increasing Hartmann number, the formation of bolus in the regime (associated with trapping) is inhibited up to a critical value of magnetic field. Flow rate, axial velocity and local wall shear stress are strongly decreased with greater Hartmann number whereas pressure difference is enhanced with higher Hartmann number at low time values but reduced with greater elapse in time. With greater electro-osmotic parameter (i.e. smaller Debye length), maximum time-averaged flow rate is enhanced, whereas the axial velocity is reduced. An increase in electrical field parameter (i.e. maximum electro-osmotic velocity) causes an increase in maximum time-averaged flow rate.

Deeper elucidation of the fluid dynamics of such transport requires the continuous need for more elegant mathematical models and numerical simulations, in parallel with laboratory investigations. In this article we therefore investigate analytically the unsteady viscous flow driven by the combined effects of peristalsis and electro-osmosis through microchannel. An integral number of waves propagating in the microchannel are considered as a model for transportation of fluid bolus along the channel length. Debye-HÃ¼ckel linearization is employed to evaluate the potential function. Low Reynolds number and large wavelength approximations are employed. Closed-form solutions are derived for the non-dimensional boundary value problem. The computations demonstrate that magnitude of electric potential function is increased with a decrease in the thickness of the electrical double layer (EDL). Stronger electric field also decelerates the flow and decreases local wall shear stress. Hydrodynamic pressure is increased with EDL thickness whereas it is suppressed with electric field. Streamline visualization reveals that the quantity of trapped bolus is decreased with increase in EDL thickness and also with higher external electric field.

Our aim is to replace SPICE simulation with our proposed surrogate models, which can be used to evaluate samples generated by sampling methods in variation space. Our methodology initiates by first characterizing the leakage of basic transistor stacks and then provides estimate of the leakage of basic gates based on these stacks. Transistor stacks are extracted across various standard cells, which are used to estimate leakage of CMOS gates with different input vector combinations. We develop Support Vector Machine (SVM) regression surrogate models and characterize the transistor stacks of CMOS gates, while accounting the combined effect of process variations in transistor length (L), threshold voltage (Vth), oxide thickness (Tox), supply voltage (0.6Vâˆ’1.2V), temperature (0Â°Câˆ’100Â°C) and width (28nmâˆ’200nm), all scalable at the same time. For gates containing parallel transistor stacks, we merge the parallel transistors having identical inputs, which in turn allows us to use precharacterized basic stacks for leakage calculation, thus avoiding generation of new models. Our experiments illustrate that we only require 30 and 26 stack models to predict the subthreshold and gate tunneling leakage of 20 different gates across 176 input combinations, instead of characterizing leakage model for each input vector separately. SVM regression models generated in our approach have the ability to predict the leakage with maximum average error of 2.7% in mean (Î¼) and maximum average error of 3.1% in standard deviation (Ïƒ), both for OAI22 gate. Our results establish that there is on an average 10Ã— improvement in runtime while estimating the Î¼ and Ïƒ of leakage of a gate within 10000 Monte Carlo simulation loop. Our approaches also result into a maximum of 221Ã— runtime improvement for C6288 ISCAS85 benchmark circuit. We further develop Sparse SVM models using Support Vector spectrum pruning method, which reduces the runtime of the regression models with negligible increase in the error. Runtime efficiency of 17Ã— and 323Ã— is achieved on standard cell library and C6288 benchmark circuit respectively using Sparse SVM models. Our models outperform previous models based on analytical equations and Artificial Neural Network in terms of accuracy.

The equations governing the transport phenomena are non-dimensionalized and the resulting boundary value problem is solved analytically in the steady state subject to physically appropriate boundary conditions. Numerical computations are conducted to quantify the effects of relevant hemodynamic, thermophysical and nanoscale parameters emerging in the model on velocity and temperature profiles, wall shear stress, impedance resistance and also streamline distributions.
