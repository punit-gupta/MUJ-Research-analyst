abstract={A dramatic increase in UV endurance of polycarbonate (PC) films were achieved via thoughtful intercalation of cesium zincate (Cs 2 ZnO 2 ) nanoparticles (NPs). The augmented UV endurance of PC/Cs 2 ZnO 2 nanocomposite (NC) films were analyzed via yellowing index quantification and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) measurements at 1713 cm −1 . The foundation for improved UV stability was owed to Cs 2 ZnO 2 NPs induced lessening of undesirable photo-degradation reactions. Moreover, the introduced NPs act to dissipate the high energy UV photons via polymer-nano metal oxide induced synergistic spectral down-conversion. The novel spectral down-conversion abilities and patina-green light emitting properties of PC/Cs 2 ZnO 2 NC films were valued with UVA-transilluminator coupled fluorescence microscopic studies. Eventually, the synergistic combination of Cs 2 ZnO 2 NPs with PC host, wherein the metal oxide offers protection against undesirable photo-degradation reactions, while the polymeric host guards the luminescence centers of nanostructured metal oxides are highly desirable for various photonic and opto-electronic applications. © 2019},

abstract={An appreciable enhancement in UV endurance of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVOH) thick films was affected using nanostructured Al 0.2 Y 1.8 O 3 semiconductors. The effect of shorter wavelength UV radiations on physico-mechanical and opto-electronic behaviors were established via morphological, optical and mechanical characterizations. The enhancement in photo-stabilities of PVOH/Al 0.2 Y 1.8 O 3 nanocomposite (NC) films were accessed via optical and mechanical performance evaluation. The optical transmittance, fluorescence emission, tensile strength and surface wettability of PVOH/Al 0.2 Y 1.8 O 3 thick films remained almost unaltered (upon UV irradiation), while there occurred detrimental changes in physico-mechanical and optical behaviors of pristine PVOH.

abstract={Herein, we report the successful fabrication of orange-red fluorescent polymer nanocomposite (PNC) hybrids, that envisage efficient photon management and appreciable UVA-protection, besides high design flexibilities and ease of self-cleaning. The visibly transparent PNC thick films were developed via aqueous solution casting of -OH backboned poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) with nanostructured sodium zincate (Na2ZnO2). The as developed PNC films offer appreciable photonic down-conversion of high energy UVA-radiations to relatively lower energy Orange-red light via fluorescent emission. The optical band gap studies reveal a direct band gap relationship with valence band maxima and conduction band minima occurring at same wave vectors. While, static contact angle measurements support nanofiller induced wettability transitions (hydrophilic to near hydrophilic). The fluorescence spectral (excitation and emission) studies of PVA/Na2ZnO2 NC films validate a promisingly large Stokes shift (~245 nm), which visualises a fair separation between the photonic absorption and emission bands, that may further aid an exponential minimization of optical losses due to re-absorption. The thermogravimetric studies support their excellent thermal stabilities. The relatively large Stokes shift, appreciable thermal stability and excellent UV harvesting ability of PVA/Na2ZnO2NC films construct them as competent luminescent down-shifting (LDS) materials for possible solar cell applications. © 2018},

abstract={Plant mediated synthesis of metal nanoparticles has gained more importance due to its simplicity, rapid rate of synthesis, low cost of operation and environment-friendliness. The present article reports the synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) from Euphorbia geniculata leaf extract (EugeAgNPs) and investigate their behaviour towards catalytic degradation of methyl orange (MO) dye and sensing of Hg2+ ions in solutions. Under the conditions of synthesis, the EugeAgNPs with an average size of about 17 nm were synthesized. Catalytic behaviour of these nanoparticles towards the reduction of MO dye by NaBH4 was also investigated. It was observed that the use of EugeAgNPs in reaction mixture has accelerated the reaction between MO dye and NaBH4 by about 102 times more than in their absence (0.95% to 97.28%) indicating that good catalytic activity of green synthesized EugeAgNPs. Further, the mercury sensing properties of synthesized EugeAgNPs were also examined. The results suggest that AgNPs obtained from Euphorbia geniculata leaf extract show excellent mercury sensing properties in the range 10 µg/mL to 120 µg/mL. Therefore, it was concluded that the AgNPs from Euphorbia geniculata leaf extract can be employed in catalytic degradation of industrial dyes as well as in optical sensing of mercury. © 2018},

abstract={The synthesized potent piperazine analog ChDiPiCa was characterised by various spectroscopic techniques and for the first time evaluated functional membrane microdomain (FMM) disassembly in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The ChDiPiCa showed excellent in vitro biocidal activity against MRSA at 26 μg/mL compared to the antibiotic streptomycin and bacitracin 14 μg/mL and 13 μg/mL at 10 μg concentration respectively. The membrane damaging property was confirmed by the SEM analysis. Further, we addressed the new approach for the first time to overcome antibiotic resistance of MRSA through membrane microdomain miss loading to lipids. By which, the ChDiPiCa confirms the significant activity in miss loading of FMM of MRSA which is validated by the fatty acid profile and lipid analysis. The result shows that, altered saturated (Lauric acid and Myristic acid), mono unsaturated (Oleic acid), and poly unsaturated (Linoleic acid and Linolenic acid) fatty acids and hypothesises, altered the membrane functional lipids. For the better understanding of miss loading of FMM by the ChDiPiCa, the in-silico molecular docking studies was analyzed and confirmed the predicted role. This suggests the way to develop ChDiPiCa in medicinal chemistry as anti-MRSA candidates and also this report opens up new window to treat microbial pathogens and infections. © 2018},

abstract={Helicobacterpylori (H. pylori) infection is a global public health concern. Due to its high adaptability in various adverse environments (temperature, pH, adhesion, phenotypic forms), targeting the bacterium is quite challenging. Moreover, due to its high persistence, decreased patience compliance and emerging antibiotic resistance, researchers have been forced to search for novel candidates with lesser or no side effects. Hence, in the current study, phytobioactives have been screened for its anti-biofilm attributes against H.pylori. Gastric biopsy samples have been screened using confirmatory techniques (microbiological, biochemical and molecular) for their virulent and non-virulent biomarkers. Physico-nutritive parameters were standardized. H. pylori biofilms were assessed using microtitre plate assay. Biofilms’ biomass and exopolysaccharide have been evaluated using crystal violet and ruthenium red staining, respectively. Anti-biofilm screening was performed using potent aqueous phytochemicals namely Acorus calamus, Colocasia esculenta and Vitex trifolia. The results indicated the confluent growth of the H. pylori biofilms confirmed through genotyping and grew best at 37 °C for 72 h at a pH of 7.5 on polystyrene plates. Further, among the phytochemicals tested, Acorus calamus exhibited the highest H. pylori anti-biofilm activity via a dose-dependent pattern. The overall observations of the study will pave way for newer approaches to understand and combat bacterial pathogenesis and will contribute towards better health and hygiene. © 2019, King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology.},

abstract={Hypertension is the fundamental cause of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disorders. Several natural and synthetic peptides are being used as antihypertensive agents, which target angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), the master regulator of angiotensin (Ang) II production. In this study, we have evaluated ACE-inhibitory potential of the tripeptide L-Phenylalanyl-D-Histidyl-L-Leucine (L-Phe-D-His-L-Leu) in vitro and its antihypertensive effect in rat model of dexamethasone-induced hypertension. L-Phe-D-His-L-Leu was custom-designed by changing the configuration of penultimate amino acid residue (histidine) from C-terminal of Ang I, the site at which ACE acts upon and generates Ang II. L-Phe-D-His-L-Leu effectively inhibited ACE activity in a dose-dependent and competitive manner with an IC50 of 53.32 ± 0.13 nmol/L. Both fluorescence spectra and circular dichroism data revealed the direct interaction between L-Phe-D-His-L-Leu and ACE. In addition, molecular docking studies revealed the strong interaction of L-Phe-D-His-L-Leu with the critical active site amino acid residues of ACE. Further, the administration of L-Phe-D-His-L-Leu resulted in decrease in blood pressure (142 ± 3 mmHg) compared to dexamethasone alone group (167 ± 2 mmHg). Besides, L-Phe-D-His-L-Leu decreased the levels of circulating Ang II, and reduced fibrosis in heart and kidney, as evidenced by decreases in collagen deposition. Thus, the strategy of incorporation of D-amino acids in ACE-inhibitory peptides could be valuable in the development of antihypertensive drugs. © 2018},

abstract={The multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is one of the most prevalent human pathogens involved in many minor to major disease burdens throughout the world. Inhibition of biofilm formation is an attractive strategy to treat diseases associated with MRSA infection. In the present investigation, a series of functional group diverse (hetero)aryl fluorosulfonyl analogs were designed, synthesized and tested as antibacterial agents against Staphylococcal spp., and as anti-biofilm candidates. Compounds 8, 15, and 67 were found to possess potent in vitro antibacterial activity among this class of sulfonyl fluorides (MIC = 0.818 ± 0.42, 0.840 ± 0.37 and 0.811 ± 0.37 μg/mL respectively). The analogs 8, 15, 36, and 67 exhibited outstanding anti-biofilm properties compared to other available synthetic antibiotics. The efficacy of synthetic analogs displayed membrane-damaging effect and they are also validated by cellular content release assay.

abstract={Silver doped aluminium oxide (AgAlO2) nanoparticles (NPs) have been synthesized by sol gel combustion method. The size and morphology of the synthesized NPs have been confirmed by high-resolution transition electron microscopy (HRTEM), and results indicate the size of the particles is around 8–14 nm with spherical in shape. A series of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) nanocomposites (NCs) have been fabricated with varying amounts viz., 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 wt% of AgAlO2 NPs using solvent intercalation technique. The intensity of crystalline peaks of NC films was reduced, and a slight shift in the peak position was observed in XRD profiles, which depicts the changes in microcrystalline behaviors of the NCs. The morphological behaviors of PVA/AgAlO2 films have been established by scanning electron microscope and atomic force microscopy. The physical interactions between the components in NCs have been evaluated by Fourier transfer infrared spectroscopy. Differential scanning calorimeter data showed a reduction in glass transition temperature (Tg) from 72 °C for PVA to 64 °C for PVA/2.5 wt% NPs. The optical constants of NCs have been evaluated from UV–Visible spectra. The obtained results reveal that band gap energy (Eg) reduces from 4.9 to 2.8 eV and refractive index increases from 1.5 to 2.4 with an increase in AgAlO2 NPs content from 0 to 2.5 wt% in PVA matrix respectively. The current–voltage (I–V) data exhibit non-ohmic behaviors at higher potential voltage region (&gt; 6 V) for NC films. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Experiments were conducted on jute fiber reinforced polypropylene (PP) composites to optimize the content of fiber in the composite. It was found to be 40wt%. In the present study, effects of hybridizing glass fibers and carbon in the optimized jute fiber reinforced PP composite have been studied. The properties such as tensile, flexural and impact with respect to randomly oriented jute, glass and carbon fiber variations in the PP matrix are considered. Jute, glass and carbon fibers reinforced PP matrix composites with different fiber contents were prepared by injection molding. Matrix content is kept as 60wt%. The hybridization of the fibers considered by weight fraction for jute and glass is 20:20, for jute and carbon is 20:20 and jute, glass and carbon is 20:10:10. Results showed that tensile, flexural and impact properties have been improved with glass fiber hybridization and further improvement in these properties are observed with carbon fiber hybridization. When glass and carbon fibers are added in 10:10 weight percentage the considered mechanical properties have been found to be nearer to the composite with 20 wt% of carbon. © IAEME Publication},

The performance of the SVM mainly depends on the selection of kernel function and soft margin parameter C. To reduce the impact of kernel function and parameter C, in this article, a novel text categorization framework called SVM-SMTP framework is developed. In the proposed SVM-SMTP framework, we used Similarity Measure for Text Processing (SMTP) measure in place of optimal separating hyper-plane as categorization decision making function. To assess the efficacy of the SVM-SMTP framework, we carried out experiments on publically available datasets: Reuters-21578 and 20-NewsGroups. We compared the results of SVM-SMTP framework with other four similarity measures viz., Euclidean, Cosine, Correlation and Jaccard. The experimental results show that the SVM-SMTP framework outperforms the other similarity measures in terms of categorization accuracy. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.},

abstract={The gap in manufacturing and assembly, in the automobile industry, is bridged by quality inspectors, who ensure that components manufactured are in proper condition to build a reliable system. However, if inspection is carried out by humans, it could lead to erroneous classification of defected components as good or vice versa, resulting in compromising of quality and wastage of material, respectively. Automation of this process is possible through the use of a vision-based inspection system and in this work such a system is proposed for cylindrical metallic components. The system uses computer vision and image processing methodologies such as morphology, edge and contour detection techniques to evaluate the errors effectively. Most systems evaluate errors stage by stage, which increases the consumption of space and cost of installation. The present inspection systems do not incorporate inspection of components that require rotation and some errors in small components cannot be detected. To not only address these issues but to also ensure reliability and efficiency, the proposed system, was tested for 250 samples, and was found to have an accuracy of 97%, which is comparable to the present systems. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={The text is a dominant source and delivers semantic information about a particular content of the respective image or video. Human often gives importance to the text than any other objects in an image or a video frame. Text detection is one of the prime part of the text information extraction process. Text detection process is an exciting and emerging research area in the zone of pattern recognition, and computer vision due to the complex background, illumination, and arbitrary orientation. In this paper, the Hidden Markov Random Field (HMRF) method and Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm are employed to detect the arbitrarily oriented multilingual text present in an image or a video frame. The proposed method calculates the max-min cluster to maximize the discrimination between textual and non-textual region. HMRF separates the textual region. EM algorithm maximizes the likelihood of the parameters. Laplacian of Gaussian process is used to identify the potential text information. The double line structure concept is employed to extract the true text region. The proposed method is evaluated on Hua’s dataset, arbitrarily oriented dataset, and horizontal dataset with performance measures recall, precision, and f-measure. The outcome shows that the approach is promising and encouraging. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.},

abstract={In this work, bottom gate top contact structured organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) were fabricated using Rubrene as active material and SiO2 as the dielectric on n-type silicon wafer by thermal evaporation method. The effect of dielectric surface modification and abrupt heat treatment on the crystallinity of Rubrene thin film and its influence on the performance of OFETs were investigated. The surface morphologies and the crystal structure of Rubrene films were characterized using differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and atomic force microscopy. It is observed that the dielectric surface affects the crystalline structure of Rubrene thin film as well as the electrical performance of the OFETs. Thermal transition of Rubrene from amorphous state to highly crystalline state was observed after abrupt heat treatment. It is observed that highly crystalline Rubrene thin films can be obtained by carefully deploying the rapid heat treatment method followed by surface treatment. The electrical properties of the OFETs such as field effect mobility, threshold voltage and current on/off ratio are evaluated using the V-I characteristics and the results are compared with the published data. Improvements in the performance of OFET are evident due to the improved crystallization and highly ordered structure of Rubrene molecules. © 2019, Universiti Malaysia Perlis. All rights reserved.},

abstract={It is not unusual for the offshore deposits to carry loads in excess to their ultimate capacity, when these soils bear the loads of heavy oil platforms. These soils contain high calcium carbonate content, which make them prone to particle crushing at these high loads. This paper investigates the effect of particle breakage on the load response of offshore marine deposits. Two sea deposits off Mumbai coast were chosen for the tests. Both the soils had similar mineralogical composition. In this study, dilatancy was studied as a function of particle crushing at crushing stresses up to 4.5 MPa. A series of direct shear tests were performed on samples which were crushed to various loads. The experimental results showed that with increase in extent of crushing, dilatancy decreased up to a point and then increased. It also indicates that crushing takes place to a considerable extent even after settlements have reached a near-constant value. The decrease in dilatancy with increase in particle crushing was more pronounced in angular particles than sub-rounded and rounded particles. This was also confirmed from the SEM images. Stress–dilatancy equations of both the soils were developed using drained shear tests. Particle breakage seems to significantly affect the measured coefficient of friction and hence the dilatancy component. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2019.},

abstract={Nowadays house construction is the basic need all over the world. Since the conventional building materials are causing degradation of the environment and also inadequate, it must be replaced by alternative building materials which are environment friendly or efficient. The mining of popular fine aggregates and quarrying of coarse aggregate results in depletion of hard rock and environmental imbalance. In view of this, there is need for developing alternative material. In most industrialized countries, the building sector accounts about one-third of total energy consumption. In order to ease this problem radical improvement is employed in building energy efficiency management. The framework design is in such a way so that it can balance between the issues such as environmental, economic and social issues. This is achieved by altering the construction method and materials used for any conventional building. The objective is to promote alternative materials to housing in such a way, that if compared with conventional materials it should prove to be an ideal alternative. Using alternative building materials save manufacturing cost, transportation, energy, time and these materials have high potential in replacing the conventional materials without compromising the strength and durability. Use of alternative technology is advantageous as it uses the locally accessible raw materials, waste products obtained from industry, etc. In this study, we have considered conventional building materials with alternative building materials by taking a residential project of 2340 SFT (including ground and first floor) and an industrial project of 3100 SFT. The cost reduction is found to be 20.17 and 18.19% in residential building and industrial building respectively hence ensuring that they are cost-effective and energy-efficient. Similarly, the reduction in embodied energy consumption is found to be 38.72% in residential and 17.78% in industrial building which shows that the utilization of alternative materials in construction ensures the building as eco-friendly. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.},

abstract={Recommendation is a technique which helps and suggests a user, any relevant item from a large information space. Current techniques for this purpose include non-probabilistic methods like content-based filtering and collaborative filtering (CF) and probabilistic methods like Bayesian inference and Case-based reasoning methods. CF algorithms use similarity measures for calculating similarity between users. In this paper, we propose a novel framework which deterministically switches between the CF algorithms based on sparsity to improve accuracy of recommendation. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.},

abstract={Nowadays, every document is very essential to be digitized. Increase in the gadgets where everyone likes to take the information in the form of images, but these images contains important information and necessary to be digitize. To do the digitization text detection in an image is one of the important stage in any field of document image analysis. But its not an easy task due to some of the challenges like complex background, varying light condition, low resolution etc. Hence, this work proposed detection of text in images. The proposed methodology consists of three steps. Initially the gabor filter is applied to extract the uncertainty features of the images. Then, 2D wavelet transform is applied to decompose the text information. Finally non-text information is removed using textual features based on the edge information. The proposed method is tested on MRRC and MSRA-TD500 standard dataset and obtained encouraging results. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.},

abstract={This paper reports the effect of interleaving and low velocity impact on the dielectric properties of non-interleaved and nylon-66 nanofiber interleaved carbon fiber (CF)-reinforced epoxy composites. The highest dielectric constant (ε′) of about 600 was achieved for non-interleaved composite laminate whereas, 47% decrease in dielectric constant for the low velocity impacted sample. Whereas, 47% decrease in dielectric constant in low velocity impacted sample. The dissipation factor (tanδ) exhibits a relaxation peak at 600 kHz and high-frequency-dependent AC conductivity (σac) in both the as-cast and impacted composites. The degree of impact damage of the carbon fiber depends upon the impact height and the percentage of interleaving. This indicates that the interleaved composites exhibit good dielectric properties after subjected to impact test. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.},

abstract={The copper based metal complexes (CMC) were synthesized using 1-phenyl-1,3-butanedione with two different solvents, methanol and water:acetic acid. The X-ray structural analysis of the two CMCs indicates that, coordination environment around the complex 1 [Cu(C10H10O2)2(CH4O)] exhibits distorted square-pyramidal geometry with trans-isomer favored structure whereas complex 2 [Cu(C10H10O2)2] exhibits distorted square-planar geometry with cis-isomer favored structure. Both copper complexes were characterized by SEM, EDX, Mass and TGA. Further, the CMCs were showed promising antibacterial activity by disc diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration assay against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. The studied model showed CMC were potent against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) validated by inhibition of electron transport chain. The formation of membrane pore/damage by CMC leads to changes in the bioelectrochemistry of the MRSA was assessed and mechanism involved in membrane damage was confirmed by SEM.

We have used the modified Masood score and designed an algorithm which classifies the various grades of breast lesions. We have used three classifiers: adaptive boosting, decision trees and random forests. These classifiers are effective tools for classifying breast lesions into benign, intermediate and malignant conditions.

abstract={Smart healthcare network is an innovative process of synergizing the benefits of sensors, Internet of things (IoT), and big data analytics to deliver improved patient care while reducing the healthcare costs. In recent days, healthcare industry faces vast challenges to save the data generated and to process it in order to extract knowledge out of it. The increasing volume of healthcare data generated through IoT devices, electronic health, mobile health, and telemedicines screening requires the development of new methods and approaches for their handling. In this chapter, we briefly discuss some of the healthcare challenges and big data analytics evolution in this fast-growing area of research with a focus on those addressed to smart health care through remote monitoring. In order to monitor the healthcare conditions of an individual, support from sensor and IoT devices is essential. The objective of this study is to provide healthcare services to the diseased as well as healthy population through remote monitoring using intelligent algorithms, tools, and techniques with faster analysis and expert intervention for better treatment recommendations. The delivery of healthcare services has become fully advanced with integration of technologies. This study proposes a novel smart healthcare big data framework for remotely monitoring physical daily activities of healthy and unhealthy population. The framework is validated through a case study which monitors the physical activities of athletes with sensors placed on wrist, chest, and ankle. The sensors connected to the human body transmit the signals continuously to the receiver. On the other hand, at the receiver end, the signals that are stored and analyzed through big data analytics techniques and machine learning algorithms are used to recognize the activity. Our proposed framework predicts whether the player is active or inactive based on the physical activities. Our proposed model has provided an accuracy of 99.96% which can be adapted to remotely monitor health conditions of old patients in case of Alzheimer’s disease by caregivers, rehabilitation, obesity monitoring, remotely monitoring of sports persons physical exertion, and it can also be beneficial for remotely monitoring chronic diseases which require vital physical information, biological, and genetic data. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

abstract={Finding the response surface by creating the design of experiments is the most important part of any optimization process. When the structure is tabular, the modern software fails to create the design of experiments in their inbuilt algorithms, or it considers the system to be a 3D model, thus imparting a large time to solve. When the response surface is of order more than 3 (dimensions), the problem becomes much harder. This paper deals with the generalized method of optimization to tackle this problem of tabular structures. For this, a FSAE car chassis is considered. And eight design variations (parameters) are considered such that diameter and thickness of tube at front bulkhead, impact attenuator, rear engine mounts and side impact attenuators during the sensitivity analysis yield the dependency of parameters on the Von Mises stress. The procedure involves sensitivity analysis, creation of design points depending on sensitivity analysis and creation of surface response which takes the form (Formula Presented) It is also shown that for specific loading condition of force, response surfaces are overlapped to find the optimal point/lines which are merely the intersection of response surfaces which satisfies all the constraints of optimization, such as stress target and constraints or dimensions. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.},

abstract={Highly flexible and visibly transparent yellow–green fluorescent poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) based nanocomposite (NC) films with rubidium zincate (Rb2ZnO2) nano impregnates were developed through aqueous solution casting. The introduced rubidium zincate nanofillers impart UV shielding properties to PVA host, through UV to visible (fluorescent yellow–green) photon cutting. The rubidium zincate nanofiller impregnated PVA systems were also characterized for their structural, morphological, optical, and electrical behaviors by various analytical tools. The Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies shed light on the changes in gross structural properties of PVA. WhileScanning Electron Microscopic (SEM) profiles support uniform filler dispersions, which aid high visible transparencies. Further, the UV–visible spectral measurements depict the changes in electronic band structure that validates novel fluorescent emission properties, established through fluorescent emission studies. The NC films show excellent visible transparency (72–84%), near hydrophobic surface wettabilities (ϴ = 82°–93°) and enhanced charge conduction, in addition to high flexibilities and UV photons induced fluorescent emission (λEmi=585 nm). The yellow–green luminescent, Rb2ZnO2 nanofillers reinforced PVA NC films are effective spectral manipulators, which may be used as competent packaging materials for photonic display devices and to extend the short wavelength limit of solar cells. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstract={Healthcare facility wastewaters (HCFWWs) are highly toxic and refractory not amenable for biological treatment. Electrochemical coagulation (ECC) is capable of treating such tough and toxic waste streams offering a shortest treatment time ≥75 min with good settling and filterability characteristics. Batch ECC was applied successfully for treatment of real HCFWWs. Two dimensional (2D) aluminum (Al) and stainless steel (SS) electrodes were arranged in bipolar mode applying cell voltages 6, 12, 18 and 24 V for ≥75 min electrolysis time (ET) with an inter electrode spacing of 10 mm having an specific electrode area to volume (SA/V) of 20 m2/m3. The optimum applied cell voltage using Al electrodes was 12 V showing 88% removal of COD, 47% nitrate, 92% phosphate, 42% sulfate, 74% color and 70% odor free clear water worth a reclamation. SS electrodes removed 82% of COD, 46% nitrates, 88% phosphate, 52% sulfates, 71% color and 70% odorless supernatant. Batch ECC for optimum 12 V were conducted for discrete ET using Al and SS for 5 min time interval up to 60 min to obtain intricate technical information. COD removals of 87.5% and 87.23% were achieved meeting the pollution control limits of 250 mg/L using 2D Al and SS electrodes within 20 min ET in discrete time ECC studies with simultaneous color removal of 74.31% and 71.92% respectively. Good sludge settling patterns were obtained for SS. Sludge volume index values of 79.36 were obtained for Al and 260.80 for SS at 12 V at 10 min ET and Centrifugal settleability index values at the same voltages were 86.89% and 96.08% for Al and SS. ECC sludge obtained using 12 V with SS showed good filterability with α (specific cake resistance) value of 4.78 × 1014 m kg−1 and Rm (resistance of the filter medium) value of 5.225 × 108 m−1. Agar plate count values were &lt;10 CFU/mL for Al and &lt;5 CFU/mL for SS. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Glass-fiber reinforced epoxy nanocomposites are widely used in high voltage outdoor applications. One of the serious problems of outdoor insulation is the surface tracking and erosion that leads to premature failure of insulation. In this paper free-space length, surface energy and surface tracking of epoxy composites with nano alumina, silica and micro alumina trihydrate fillers and unidirectional glass fiber reinforcement are discussed. Quantitative interfacial analysis has been used by determining the freespace length of the composites. The results of tracking are explained on the basis of contact angle measurements and the concept of surface energy is used to substantiate the results. The time-to-track and surface erosion of dry and water treated nanocomposites are determined by the inclined plane tracking and erosion method. The experimental results have revealed that the hydrophobic nature of glass epoxy composites improves with addition of fillers. The surface energy, wettability and interaction parameters show reduction with the addition of fillers. It is observed that the Glass Epoxy composite with combination of nano alumina, silica and micro ATH fillers exhibits good thermal, electrical and mechanical properties with improved tracking and erosion resistance. © 1994-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Construction sector is one of the largest end users of environmental resources and is one of the largest polluters of manmade and natural environments around the globe. Economic development, climate change due to the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, energy security and energy access are the primary concerns for India. Sustainable development in energy sector has become a concern for all the people in the world. Sustainability means it satisfies the needs of the people without jeopardizing the prospects of the future generation. To minimize these effects, the concept of Green Building has been introduced in the construction industry. To asses these buildings, there are various building assessment tools which have emerged globally. These assessment tools have been developed and used to assist the planning and design of sustainable buildings. The aim is to develop complete environmental consciousness among construction specialists towards sustainable performance and to achieve the objective of sustainability in the construction sector. In this study, the assessment approaches towards environmental, economic and social aspects are discussed. The comparative study and analysis on these building assessment tools i.e. LEED-India, GRIHA and IGBC have been made. It is found that there may be inconsistence in the assessment tools and criteria. However, lack of fully integrated assessment tools has resulted in the lack of a holistic assessment approach for the building life cycle. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={This paper presents a modified intuitionistic fuzzy clustering (IFCM) algorithm for medical image segmentation. IFCM is a variant of the conventional fuzzy C-means (FCM) based on intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) theory. Unlike FCM, IFCM considers both membership and nonmembership values. The existing IFCM method uses Sugeno's and Yager's IFS generators to compute nonmembership value. But for certain parameters, IFS constructed using above complement generators does not satisfy the elementary condition of intuitionism. To overcome this problem, this paper adopts a new IFS generator. Further, Hausdorff distance is used as distance metric to calculate the distance between cluster center and pixel. Extensive experimentations are carried out on standard datasets like brain, lungs, liver and breast images. This paper compares the proposed method with other IFS based methods. The proposed algorithm satisfies the elementary condition of intuitionism. Further, this algorithm outperforms other methods with the use of various cluster validity functions. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.},

The interaction parameters such as α, β, µ, and Δ[η]m indicated the miscible nature of poly(GVGVP)/PVP blends. Immiscibility occurred when the quantity of poly(GVGVP) is lesser than 60%. In the solid phase, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic scrutiny of the thin films of poly(GVGVP)/PVP blends indicated the presence of strong intermolecular interaction such as hydrogen bonds linking the blend components. This result was further supported by glass transition temperature (Tg), scanning electron microscopic, and X-ray diffraction studies.

abstract={Energy efficient and load-balanced routing based on QoS requirements in Wireless Multimedia Sensor Network have been achieved using Energy Enhanced Load Balancing Pairwise Directional Geographical Routing (EELB-PWDGR). However, the process of path selection is a time-consuming one. Hence, Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) is used to select the optimal path satisfying QoS constraints. Though the ABC-EELB-PWDGR outperforms EELB-PWDGR, the ABC algorithm exhibits unsatisfactory performance with a lower search speed, poor population diversity, stagnation within working methods, and struck to the local optimal solution. This study uses an enhanced ABC algorithm in which the global best solution information is added into the solution search equations in order to find the new solution only around the best solutions of the previous iterations for improved exploitation. Since Population initialization is imperative due to its impact on convergence speed, an initialization approach which based on chaotic systems and opposition based learning method has been employed to balance the diversity and convergence capability of ABC. Thus the Enhanced ABC based EELB-PWDGR (EABC-EELB-PWDGR) constructs an initial population with a maximum diversity to provide the best search solutions and a high degree of accuracy. The experimental results prove that the proposed EABC-EELB-PWDGR provides better routing performance than ABC-EELB-PWDGR. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.},

abstract={Epoxy based Shape Memory Polymers (SMEPs) of varying crosslinking densities were prepared by reacting an aromatic epoxy resin, Diglycidyl Ether of Bisphenol A (DGEBA) with different aliphatic amines varying in chain lengths, triethylenetetramine (TETA), 2,2′ethylenedioxybisethylamine (EDEA) and 4,7,10-Trioxa-1, 13-Tridecanediamine (TTD). Shape memory tests were conducted for all three SMEPs by deforming the samples at temperatures greater than their Tg in flexure (3 point bending). The effect of crosslinking density (CLD), shape fixing temperature (Tfix) and shape recovery temperature (Trec) on shape memory behaviour of SMEPs were studied systematically. In terms of the chemical structure, the results showed that with the increase in CLD, glass transition temperature (Tg) increased with an associated reduction in the shape recovery behaviour. However, superior shape memory behaviour was observed for lower CLD SMEPs. With respect to the process parameters, as the Tfix was lowered below the Tg, % shape fixity increased and the recovery curves shifted towards higher temperature. When Trec was increased above the Tg, recovery rate increased. © 2018, The Institution of Engineers (India).},

abstract={The present study emphasizes the need for novel antimicrobial agents to combat the global drug resistant crisis. The development of novel nanomaterials is reported to be of the alternative tool to combat drug resistant pathogens. In present investigation, bioconjugated nano-complex was developed from secondary metabolite secreted from endosymbiont. The endosymbiont capable of secreting antimicrobial metabolite was subjected to fermentation and the culture supernatant was assessed for purification of antimicrobial metabolite via bio-assay guided fraction techniques such as thin layer chromatography (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and column chromatography. The metabolite was characterized as 2,4-Diacetylphloroglucinol (2,4 DAPG) which was used to develop bioconjugated nano-complex by treating with 1 mM silver nitrate under optimized conditions. The purified metabolite 2,4 DAPG reduced silver nitrate to form bioconjugated nano-complex to form association with silver nanoparticles. The oxidized form of DAPG consists of four hard ligands that can conjugate on to the surface of silver nanoparticles cluster. The bioconjugation was confirmed with UV–visible spectroscopy which displayed the shift and shoulder peak in the absorbance spectra. This biomolecular interaction was further determined by the Fourier-transform spectroscopy (FTIR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses which displayed different signals ascertaining the molecular binding of 2,4,DAPG with silver nanoparticles. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis revealed the cluster formation due to bioconjugation. The XRD analysis revealed the crystalline nature of nano-complex with the characteristic peaks indexed to Bragg's reflection occurring at 2θ angle which indicated the (111), (200), (220) and (311) planes. The activity of bioconjugated nano-complex was tested against 12 significant human and phytopathogens. Among all the test pathogens, Shigella flexneri (MTCC 1457) was the most sensitive organisms with 38.33 ± 0.33 zone of inhibition. The results obtained in the present investigation attribute development of nano-complex as one of the effective tools against multi-drug resistant infections across the globe. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Limited light absorption, inefficient electron-hole separation, and unsuitable positions of conduction band bottom and/or valence band top are three major critical issues associated with high-efficiency photocatalytic water treatment. An attempt has been carried out here to address these issues through the synthesis of direct Z-scheme Cs2O-Bi2O3-ZnO heterostructures via a facile, fast, and economic method: solution combustions synthesis. The photocatalytic performances are examined by the 4-chlorophenol degradation test under simulated sunlight irradiation. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy analysis, electrochemical impedance test, and the observed transient photocurrent responses prove not only the significant role of Cs2O in extending light absorption to visible and near-infrared regions but also its involvement in charge carrier separation. Radical-trapping experiments verify the direct Z-scheme approach followed by the charge carriers in heterostructured Cs2O-Bi2O3-ZnO photocatalysts. The Z-scheme charge carrier pathway induced by the presence of Cs2O has emerged as the reason behind the efficient charge carrier separation and high photocatalytic activity.

abstract={In the present study, dielectric and thermal properties of poly(aryl ether ketone) (PAEK)-nanocomposites with varying weight percentage of magnesium oxide (MgO) have been reported. The thermal properties of PAEK/MgO nanocomposites were studied using differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, thermo-mechanical analysis and thermal conductivity. Transmission electron microscopy of the developed nanocomposites shows agglomerate-free dispersion of MgO nanoparticles in PAEK matrix. From the dielectric properties, dielectric constant of 13 was achieved for 10 wt% PAEK/MgO nanocomposite at 230°C. Further, minimum tan δ and maximum volume resistivity were found for 10 wt% PAEK/MgO nanocomposite. Data from thermal studies indicate that the incorporation of MgO into PAEK significantly enhanced the glass transition temperature and slightly deteriorated the thermal stability, char yield, and flame-retardant properties. Also, highest thermal conductivity and lowest coefficient of thermal expansion were achieved at 10 wt% of the MgO content. An excellent combination of both dielectric and thermal properties of the PAEK/MgO nanocomposites developed in the present study finds its potential application in microelectronics and electrical insulation in power equipments. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.},

abstract={In recent decades, increased energy demand and depletion of conventional energy sources has drawn attraction towards the use of renewable energy sources. Solar energy is one such a non-depleting source which can be utilized to generate an electricity with the help of solar photovoltaic. Globally, there are lot of research is going on in the conversion of solar energy in to useful electrical energy. Now a days, multi-level inverters are drawing lot of attention for the researchers due to their advantages. Use of dc-dc converters have become a common converter in many of the applications. The integration of dc-dc converter and multi-level inverter has advantage in elimination of transformer in the converter. The paper proposes a dc-dc converter integrated with asymmetrical multi-level inverter for solar PV application, with separate sources and also for a single source. The proposed converters are simulated in MATLAB/Simulink with and without a filter circuit. Output voltage/current waveforms and the total harmonic distortion is observed. The feasibility of the proposed converter is validated. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={The nanocomposite films of poly vinylpyrrolidone (PVP) with different amounts viz., 2, 4, 6 and 8 wt% of cesium aluminate (CsAlO2) have been fabricated using solvent casting technique.

The UV-visible transmittance studies revealed that the UV light absorbing nature of nanocomposite films with considerable visible transparency. The Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectral studies visualizes the effect of CsAlO2 nanofiller on the structural behaviors of PVP, while optical studies reveals an obvious change in the electronic band structure leading to a significant reduction in optical band gaps.

abstract={This paper discusses a novel approach to detect inter frame and intra frame video forgery using content based signature. A novel technique called the “Spatio Temporal Triad Feature Relationship” (STTFR) is employed to generate a unique content based signature – value for any given video sequence. The proposed STTFR algorithm aims to verify video integrity through the creation of a 128 bit message digest from the input video of variable length that will be unique to that video and acts as a fingerprint. Change in the video sequence, either at the spatial or at the temporal level will result in a different fingerprint than the one obtained originally. The knowledge of the signature will not enable any person/entity to recreate the original video as the signature is generated by combining spatial and temporal fingerprints in an orderly and systematic approach.

abstract={Despite the ever-increasing global incidence of dengue fever, there are no specific chemotherapy regimens for its treatment. Structural studies on dengue virus (DENV) proteins have revealed potential drug targets. Major DENV proteins such as the envelope protein and non-structural (NS) proteins 3 and 5 have been extensively investigated in antiviral studies, but with limited success in vitro. However, the minor NS proteins NS2 and NS4 have remained relatively underreported. Emerging evidence indicating their indispensable roles in virus propagation and host immunomodulation should encourage us to target these proteins for drug discovery. This review covers current knowledge on DENV NS2 and NS4 proteins from structural and functional perspectives and assesses their potential as targets for antiviral design. Antiviral targets in NS2A include surface-exposed transmembrane regions involved in pathogenesis, while those in NS2B include protease-binding sites in a conserved hydrophilic domain. Ideal drug targets in NS4A include helix α4 and the PEPEKQR sequence, which are essential for NS4A–2K cleavage and NS4A–NS4B association, respectively. In NS4B, the cytoplasmic loop connecting helices α5 and α7 is an attractive target for antiviral design owing to its role in dimerization and NS4B–NS3 interaction. Findings implicating NS2A, NS2B, and NS4A in membrane-modulation and viroporin-like activities indicate an opportunity to target these proteins by disrupting their association with membrane lipids. Despite the lack of 3D structural data, recent topological findings and progress in structure-prediction methods should be sufficient impetus for targeting NS2 and NS4 for drug design. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={In the present work, we report the selective and sensitive electrochemical detection of L-dopa using crude Polyphenol oxidase enzyme (PPO) immobilized on electrochemically reduced graphene oxide–silver nanoparticles (RGO-Ag) nano composite modified graphite (Gr) electrode. The Gr electrode is first modified through the electrochemical reduction of graphene oxide - silver (GO-Ag) nano composite to RGO-Ag nano composite on graphite electrode. The crude extract of PPO from Manilkara Zapota (sapota) fruit is later immobilized onto Gr/RGO-Ag modified electrode. Modification of Gr electrode at each step is confirmed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and Electrochemical impedance (EIS) techniques. The surface characterization of modified electrode is performed by Scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The developed sensor exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity towards the detection of L-dopa in the concentration range of 1–150 µM with low detection limit and high sensitivity. Further, the practical applicability of the developed biosensor is examined for the detection of L-dopa in urine samples. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Frequency dependence of the electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness of carbon fiber epoxy composites have been investigated over the frequency range of 8&#x2013;18&#x00A0;GHz. The effect of nylon-66 nanofiber interleaving on the shielding effectiveness of the multilayered quasi-isotropic composite has been examined for three different percentages of interleaving of nylon-66 nanofibers. Effect of &#x03B3;-irradiation on the electromagnetic shielding efficiency has also been investigated. Though attenuation due to absorption is dominant in carbon fiber epoxy composites, it is observed that &#x03B3;-irradiation helps in improving the attenuation due to reflection of the electromagnetic waves. The observed variations in the EM shielding of the composites are explained on the basis of the measured attenuation of EM radiations by absorption and reflection. The investigation has highlighted the usefulness of the carbon fiber epoxy composites, which are traditionally used in mechanical strength applications, for electromagnetic shielding in the range of microwave frequencies.

abstract={To enhance the bioactivity of hydroxyapatite (HA), various ions have been incorporated into its porous structure such as zinc. Zinc has shown to have a stimulatory effect on osteoblastic cells. This study attempts to evaluate the efficacy of an indigenously prepared zinc incorporated nanohydroxyapatite (ZINH) bone graft in the treatment of intrabony defects. Materials and Methods: A split-mouth study, which consists of 11 systemically healthy subjects with 45 sites, were randomly treated with ZINH or with nanoHA alone. Plaque index, gingival index, gingival bleeding index, pocket depth (PD) and clinical attachment level (CAL) were assessed at baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Bone probing depth (BPD) and radiographic parameters were assessed at baseline, 6, and 12 months. Statistical analysis used was student's t-test and one-way analysis of variance. Results: At 12 months, PD and BPD reduction was more in test (4.37 ± 0.989 mm and 3.36 ± 0.446 mm) than control (2.81 ± 0.084 mm and 2.15 ± 0.159 mm). Gain in CAL for test (3.08 ± 0.148 mm) was higher than control (2.33 ± 0.278 mm). Furthermore amount and percentage of bone fill was higher in test (1.92 ± 0.702 mm, 54.7 ± 20.286, respectively) than control (1.38 ± 0.650 mm, 40.2 ± 20.972, respectively). Statistically significant improvements in all parameters were seen in the test sites at 12 months. Conclusion: ZINH bone graft can be considered as a prospective bone regenerative material. © 2018 Contemporary Clinical Dentistry.},

abstract={Lack of known mechanisms of protection against Staphylococcus aureus in humans represents an important risk factor for skin infections and bacteremia in patients, intern hindering the development of efficacious vaccines. However, development of effective humoral response may be dampened by converging immune-evasion mechanisms of S. aureus. To develop a promising vaccine against S. aureus, it is pre-requisite to clear understanding of cutaneous, innate and adaptive immune response. The S. aureus dampening the humoral response, T cell help, blocking complement factors, and killing immune players by its toxins are the important factors need to understand clearly. We hypothesized that the master mechanism of S. aureus counteracts may hindering the immune action which may result in failure of target-oriented vaccine development.

abstract={In the present scenario the productivity and the quality of the machining products are the main important challenges of metal cutting or in production industry during turning processes. Due to which manufacturing industries are competing in the market field. In the improvement of output quality of the product, the optimization technique like Taguchi's method is a very good tool and effective method to improve performance and quality of manufacturing industries. This paper presents optimization parameters such as cutting speed, depth of the cut and feed in the dry conditions of titanium grade-5 materials and PVD carbide tool. To achieve minimum tool wear the surface temperature of the workpiece should be low. The experiment design or design of experiment based on the Taguchi's L9 orthogonal array technique was performed to identify the effect of cutting parameters on the different response variables. The results of the turning machining experiments of titanium-grade-5 characterize the main factors affecting the surface roughness by analysis of variance (ANOVA) method. The minimum tool wear was found at a lower speed and the feed rate was found to be the most significant parameters to influence the surface roughness of grade -5 materials in turning process. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={In the present competitive economic environment, it is very much essential for the manufacturing plants to achieve world class operation standards along with high quality and timely delivery of goods. This requires excellent maintenance practices to increase the availability of the machines, to reduce production cost and to produce goods with desired quality level. Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) implementation is an approach to improve the performance of maintenance activities. It aims to maximize the equipment effectiveness by the total participation of all employees. But most of the manufacturing plants are not able to harvest the benefits of TPM practices due to lack of planning and proper awareness. This work is carried out in order to study the usage of TPM in the selected SMEs (Small and Medium sized Enterprises). A total of 50 SMEs involving manufacturing, process and service industries are considered for the study. The primary data is collected through a structured questionnaire consisting of 24 questions related to TPM implementation. The respondents are randomly selected involving chief executives, engineers, managers and supervisors. A five point Likert scale is selected to rate the respondent's opinion. The results are analysed using simple graphical representations and conclusions are drawn based on the feedback obtained from the respondents. It has been found that 52% of SMEs (26 out of 50) have adopted TPM in their organizations and remaining 48% have not yet implemented TPM. The study helps to find out the extent to which the TPM being used in SMEs and what are the possible reasons for not implementing TPM. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

This is due to exponential growth of the Internet users, which in turn increases the growth of the internet traffic. As Internet grows, different types of Internet traffic generated over the network also grow. This recommends proposing new methods to identify and classify the network traffic. In this paper, we proposed to embed Fishers's Discriminate Ratio (FDR) with Sequential Forward Selection (SFS), Sequential Backward Selection (SBS) and Plus L Minus R feature selection methods to analyze and classify the Internet traffic. To evaluate the proposed method, we used publicly available KDDcup99 dataset.

abstract={In this paper, we present a new text categorization model using consensus clustering to categorize text documents. Initially, text documents are pre-processed and represented in the form of Term Document Matrix (TDM). Further, consensus clustering is used for text categorization. The consensus clustering has two units: Cluster generation and consensus function. In cluster generation unit, we generate clustering results by applying base clustering (K-Means, Fuzzy C-means (FCM) and Intuitionistic Fuzzy C-means (IFCM)) methods. In the consensus function unit, the generated results of base clustering methods are aggregated. Further, voting technique is applied on aggregated results to obtain consolidated cluster. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model, experiments are conducted on balanced (20-Newgroups) and unbalanced (Reuters-21578) standard benchmark datasets. We used accuracy, precision, recall and F-measure to assess the performance. The performance of the proposed model is investigated against base clustering methods (K-Means, FCM and IFCM). The experimental result reveals that the proposed model performance is better than base clustering methods. Moreover, consensus clustering eliminates the limitation of base clustering methods and also quality of the final categorization result can be improved. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Robotic vision is an ideal sensor for many robot platforms. By making robots perform adverse tasks, engineers today are working towards the eternal goal of bringing robots closer to human life. One such task is recognition or authentication of a person which is essential in both social and industrial domains. Upon finding a face, the face recognition robot either recognizes it to be one from the database, or in case of a new person, adds it to the database. Indeed, there are a number of existing algorithms that have been used to achieve this goal. For vision-based autonomous robots in dynamic domain it is crucial that the processing algorithms are fast in addition to being robust. This paper compares the efficiency of three algorithms - Eigenfaces, Fisherfaces and Local Binary Patterns Histograms. It also compares the implementation of these algorithms on a Raspberry Pi against that on a PC. Empirical results demonstrating the robotic platform performing face recognition under various circumstances, justify the validity of the proposed design of a face recognition robot. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Increase in population leads to an enhancement of huge demand for electricity. The rapid growth in the industrial sector and booming real estate often overstress the electrical network. However, Transformers are the backbone of the electrical network, due to the fact that it converts the generating voltage to the user end voltage. The reliability of the power network mainly depends on transformer performance. Mineral oil is generally used as cooling and insulating medium in transformer. Thermo-electric and chemical stresses on transformer leads to oil deterioration called 'ageing'. Ageing changes the oil properties such as acidity, tanδ, power factor, interfacial tension and viscosity. Extensive experimental evaluation has been fruitful to establish the acidity and tanδ of the transformer oil. Here, we are proposing Image processing technique to estimate the oil properties, which is inexpensive and effective technique. Namely Correlation coefficient and moments are extended to compute the Neutralization Number (NN) or Acidity and tanδ (Dissipation factor). Further they compared. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Suspicious activities seriously endanger at public areas and personal security. There are millions of video surveillance systems used in public areas, such as streets, prisons, holy sites, airports, and supermarkets. It is essential to investigate the detection and recognition of suspicious activities contents from surveillance video. The common suspicious activities at public areas with an aspect of security are fighting, running, leave luggage and run, put an unusual packet in somewhere like a dustbin and leave. We focus on the recognition of suspicious activity and aim to find a method that can automatically detect suspicious activity using computer vision methods. Complex background, illumination changes and different distances between the human and the camera have made this topic very challenging, especially in the case of real-time applications. We adopted GMM to produce candidate regions whose has suspicious activity of motion features extracted from the magnitude information of Optical Flow, and we call this method Suspicious Activity Region Detector (SARD). Experimental results on several benchmark datasets have demonstrated the robustness of our proposed framework over the state-of-the-arts in terms of both detection accuracy and processing speed, even in crowded scenes. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={In the current research investigation, polycarbonate/hallyosite nanotubes (PC/HNTs) nanocomposite (NC) films have been successfully fabricated by solution intercalation technique using ultrasound energy in facile way which helps complete exfoliation of the HNTs in the matrix. The effect of Gamma irradiation-induced modifications of PC/HNTs NC have been studied in the dose range 200–500 kGy, irradiated with Co60 source. The NC films have been evaluated by UV–visible spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopic techniques in order to probe the effect of gamma radiation on the structural behaviors. The obtained results have been indicated that as the Gamma irradiation dosage increases from 200 to 500 kGy, phenolic group forms through scissoring of ester link of PC, which may cause PC to degrade and lose their property. At lower dosage (200 kGy), the effect is less and at higher dosage (500 kGy), the effect is significant and at 300 and 400 kGy, the effect is moderate and NC films retained their properties. The irradiation effect is most significant and effective at the higher dosage range. UV–visible spectroscopy shows a noticeable reduction in the energy band gap due to gamma irradiation. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Cancer therapy using minimal invasive technique has been a challenge since decades. In the present research, the concept of photodynamic cancer therapy (PDT) has been applied on biologically synthesized nanoparticles for the treatment of skin melanoma (B16F10) and epidermoid carcinoma (A431) cells. The biologically synthesized nanoparticles have been conjugated with a photosensitizer drug 5-aminolevulinic (5-ALA) acid to treat cancer cells by activating the protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) formation through irradiation. Bacterial strain Escherichia coli was used for the synthesis of gold nanoparticles. The size and characteristics of nanoparticles were studied with scanning electron microscope, dynamic light scattering and zeta potential analysis. The gold nanoparticles were encapsulated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and tagged with 5-aminolevulinic acid, a photosensitizer drug. The drug was activated using a halogen lamp to enhance the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) molecules. The cytotoxicity of pure nanoparticles and conjugated nanoparticles were assessed on skin melanoma and epidermoid carcinoma cell lines and compared against standard drug 5-ALA, and the production of ROS molecules was measured using a 2,7 dichlorofluorescein-diacetate (DCFH-DA) probe. The results indicated that pure gold nanoparticles had greater cytotoxicity on cells compared to 5-ALA and gold-5-ALA conjugate. But when the cells were subjected to irradiation, the gold-5-ALA conjugate showed higher cytotoxicity than 5-ALA and pure nanoparticles. The cytotoxic levels of gold-5-ALA conjugates were doubled which indicated greater reactive oxygen molecule production compared to other samples. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Natural fiber–plastic composites are being used for many light structural applications. The thermal behaviour is particularly important for applications where product is subjected to conditions which are above ambient temperatures like under the hood auto components, processes involving elevated temperatures like curing, reprocessing, or in case of fire damage. This paper discusses thermal decomposition kinetics of Jute reinforced High Density Polyethylene (HDPE). The thermal behaviour of jute fiber reinforced high density polyethylene composites was studied by thermogravimetric analysis. Jute reinforced HDPE composites exhibited sequential degradation of jute appearing at around 375 °C and that of HDPE at around 485 °C. Horowitz–Metzger and Coates–Redfern methods were used to evaluate kinetic parameters associated with thermal degradation of jute fiber filled composites. The result also showed that both jute and HDPE degrades in two distinct steps. Apparent activation energy of around 50 and 95 kJ/mol for jute and approximately 245 and 345 kJ/mol for HDPE was obtained. © 2018, Indian Academy of Wood Science.},

abstract={Dynamic modulus of elasticity (DMoE) of natural fiber reinforced high density polyethylene composites prepared with variety of fibers and their different proportions was determined using ultrasonic pulse propagation method. The DMoE was compared with the static modulus of elasticity as determined by both tensile and flexural test. The elastic modulus of the composites increased with the increasing fiber content irrespective of type of fiber. However, the incremental rate in modulus was varying with fiber type. Jute fibers resulted in maximum improvement whereas coir fibers reinforcement had marginal improvement in stiffness of the composites. The elastic modulus was theoretically modelled for all fiber types based on the elastic modulus of the fibers and HDPE and the model was effective in describing the change in modulus with increasing fiber content. There was a strong correlation between DMoE and static MoE (both tensile and flexural modulus). The ratio of DMoE to static MoE was found to vary with fiber content and smaller differences were observed in stiffer composites. This suggests that static MoE was influenced by the visco-elastic behaviour of HDPE and its composites at lower fiber content. © 2018, Indian Academy of Wood Science.},

abstract={Increasing IoT traffic in LTE-A networks imposes several issues such as RACH congestion due to large number of devices accessing the network at the same time. EAB (extended access barring) based solutions have been proven to be efficient methods of giving instant relief from RACH congestion in the network. But current EAB solutions are not suitable for the scenario where network traffic is from mixture of light, moderate, and high delay tolerant IoT devices. As a result, these solutions may lead to unnecessary barring of some of the IoT devices. In this paper, we have proposed a noble EAB algorithm which pro-actively monitors the congestion in the network and avoids collective barring of IoT devices. The algorithm has been evaluated based on various metrics such as success rate, average delay, and average backoff. Apart from this, the paper analyses the performance of H2H and M2M devices when moderate congestion reduction methods such as Long-Backoff method, Separate Preamble method, and Slotted Access method are merged with the proposed EAB algorithm. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Energy need has been increasing worldwide exponentially. At present global energy requirements are mostly dependent on the fossil fuels, which eventually lead to foreseeable depletion of limited fossil energy sources. In this context, regeneration of the electricity with dairy wastewater is one of the better possibilities. Now a days, countries like India in progressing towards harnessing new energy sources. Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) have been thoroughly investigated by many researchers in the past and concluded that MFCs could be applied for the treatment of liquid waste streams and also in generation of electricity. From a variety of materials, including complex organic waste and renewable biomass. These sources provide M FCs with a great advantage over chemical fuel cells that can utilize only purified reactive fuels (e.g., hydrogen). A developing primary application of MFCs is its use in wastewater treatment coupled with electricity generation, although further technical developments are necessary for its practical use. The aim of this study was to test a novel MFC design for dairy wastewater treatment and simultaneous electricity production. The hypothesis of the design was to bring MFCs closer to large scale industrialization. As such the materials and mechanics of the design were conceived with the consideration of the needs of large scale wastewater treatment plants. Higher percentage of COD and BOD removal and significant electricity generation using MFC can be achieved. Thus the combination of wastewater treatment along with the electricity production may help in saving of millions of rupees. © IAEME Publication.},

abstract={Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) has been used for qualitative assessment of defects in reinforced concrete structures, such as corrosion-induced deterioration in concrete bridges. However, reliable quantitative models for GPR estimations of reinforcing bar corrosion are unavailable. This study quantitatively related the reinforcing bar corrosion with the maximum reflected waveform amplitude from GPR scanning. Accelerated corrosion was used to induce reinforcing bar corrosion, and GPR scanning monitored corrosion at three stages: Before and after submersion into saltwater solution and at the end of a preset corrosion period. As expected, the reinforcing bar corrosion mass loss was greater for longer corrosion periods, larger reinforcing bar size, and lower cover. The GPR amplitude increased with increased corrosion activity. A set of polynomial curves were proposed for particular dielectric constant, reinforcing bar size and cover. The model was calibrated with the GPR scan data from a portion of a demolished old concrete bridge deck. © 2018 American Concrete Institute. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Natural fibre based composites are under intensive study due to their eco friendly nature and peculiar properties. The advantage of natural fibres is their continuous supply, easy and safe handling, and biodegradable nature. Although natural fibres exhibit admirable physical and mechanical properties, it varies with the plant source, species, geography, and so forth. Pineapple leave fibre (PALF) is one of the abundantly available waste materials in India and has not been studied yet. The work has been carried out to fabrication and study the mechanical characterization of Pineapple Leaf fiber reinforced Vinylester composites filled with different particulate fillers. These results are compared with those of a similar set of glass fiber reinforced Vinylester composites filled with same particulate fillers. It is evident that the density values for Pineapple leaf fiber (PALF) - Vinylester composites increase with the particulate filler content and void fractions in these composites also increase. The test results show that with the presence of particulate fillers, micro hardness of the PALF-Vinylester composites has improved. Among all the composites under this investigation, the maximum hardness value is recorded for PALF-Vinylester composite filled with 20 wt% alumina. In this investigation the maximum value of ILSS has been recorded for the PALF-Vinylester composite with 20 wt% of Flyash. © 2018 Author(s).},

abstract={Herein, we report the successful formulation and refractive index (RI) engineering of poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) films with varying amounts viz., 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 wt% lithium zincate (Li2ZnO2) nanoparticles. The as developed nanocomposite (NC) films were structurally characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (P-XRD) studies, that validate the presence of Li2ZnO2 nanofillers in PVA host. While, Li2ZnO2 nanofiller induced changes in morphological behaviors were validated from scanning electron microscopic (SEM) studies. The UV - visible transmittance studies narrate excellent UV (&lt; 400 nm) harvesting abilities of NC films, in conjunction with a near complete visible (&gt; 400 nm) transmittance. The transmittance intensity was found to exhibit a monotonic decrease with nanofiller content, especially in the UV regions. The absorption edges were found to be down-shifted towards lower energy values exhibiting a minimum of 4.42 eV for PVA/4 wt% Li2ZnO2 NC film. Further, the RI of the PVA films showed a gradual increase from 1.72 to 2.21 with an increase in filling levels (FLs) from 0 to 4 wt%. The effect of annealing on optical transmittance and RI of PVA films were also studied at different temperatures. The PVA/Li2ZnO2 NC films were also studied for their light emitting functionalities. © 2018 Author(s).},

abstract={The present investigation deals with the fabrication and characterization of epoxy reinforced with bidirectional carbon fiber mat (CF/Ep) and filled with 2.5, 5 and 7.5 wt% potassium titanate whiskers (PTw) composites. The effect of PTw loading on hardness, tensile properties and dry sliding wear behaviour of CF/Ep composite were carefully investigated in expectation of providing valuable information for the application of hybrid CF/Ep composites. Results indicated that the incorporation of PTw actually improved the hardness, tensile strength and tensile modulus of CF/Ep composites. Meanwhile, the specific wear rate of CF/Ep filled by 5 wt % PTw reached to 6.3× 10-14 m3/N-m, which is 41% lower than that of CF/Ep composite at the same dry sliding condition. It also seen that the fiber and filler worked synergistically to enhance the wear resistance. Further, for all composites the friction coefficient increases with increase in load and sliding velocity. However, PTw reinforced CF/Ep exhibited considerably higher coefficient of friction compared to unfilled ones, while PTw filler loading of 5 wt% was effective in reducing the specific wear rate of CF/Ep composite. The carbon fiber carried the applied load between the contact surfaces and protected the epoxy from severe abrasion of the counterface. At the same time, the exposed PTw out of the epoxy matrix around the fiber inhibited the direct scraping between the fiber and counterface so that the fibers could be less directly impacted during the subsequent wear process and they were protected from severe damage. © 2018 Author(s).},

abstract={Trans-[Cu(O∩O)2] complex, O∩O = 4,4,4-trifluoro-1-(thiophen-2-yl)butane-1,3-dione was reported with high potential toward CT-DNA binder. The solved XRD-structure of complex indicated a perfect regular square-planer geometry around the Cu(II) center. The trans/cis-DFT-isomerization calculation supported the XRD seen in reflecting the trans-isomer as the kinetic-favor isomer. The desired complex structure was also characterized by conductivity measurement, CHN-elemental analyses, MS, EDX, SEM, UV–Vis., FT-IR, HAS and TG/DTG. The Solvatochromism behavior of the complex was evaluated using four different polar solvents. MPE and Hirshfeld surface analysis (HSA) come to an agreement that fluoride and thiophene protons atoms are with suitable electro-potential environment to form non-classical H-bonds of type CTh–H⋯F. The DNA-binding properties were investigated by viscosity tests and spectrometric titrations, the results revealed the complex as strong calf-thymus DNA binder.

abstract={In society, there exists a gap in communication between the sighted community and the visually challenged people due to different scripts followed to read and write. To bridge this gap there is a need for a system that supports automatic conversion of Braille script to text and speech in the corresponding language. Optical Braille Recognition (OBR) system converts the hand-punched Braille characters into their equivalent natural language characters. The Text-to-Speech (TTS) system converts the recognized characters into audible speech using speech synthesis techniques. Existing literature reveals that OBR and TTS systems have been well established independently for English. There is a scope for development of OBR and TTS systems for regional languages. In spite of Kannada being one of the most widely spoken regional languages in India, minimal work has been done towards Kannada OBR and TTS. There is no system that directly converts Braille script to speech, therefore, this development of Kannada Braille to text and speech system is one of a kind. The acquired image is processed and feature extraction is performed using k-means algorithm and heuristics to convert the Braille characters to Kannada script. The concatenation based speech synthesis technique employing phoneme as the basic unit is used to convert Kannada TTS using Festival TTS framework. Performance evaluation of the proposed system is done using Kannada Braille database developed independently, and the results obtained are found to be satisfactory when compared to existing methods in the literature. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) has now become a common term in technological communities. Machine-to-machine communications (M2M) is one of the components of IoT which deals with communication of devices to device and device to the network aspects. LTE-A networks have emerged as one of the preferred underlying communication networks to support IoT or M2M traffic. However, the uplink packet scheduling to optimize the QoS (quality of service) of M2M traffic without affecting or least affecting the QoS of Human-to-human (H2H) traffic (traffic generated by regular users (also called as H2H users) such as smartphone traffic, Internet traffic, voice traffic, etc.) is one of the main challenges in LTE-A networks. As a solution, we propose an uplink packet scheduling algorithm, called as enhanced class based dynamic priority (E-CBDP) algorithm, which ensures the QoS of H2H traffic by giving it priority over M2M traffic but, optimizes the QoS of M2M traffic by pushing the scheduling of H2H traffic to their delay boundaries. Further, a dynamic M2M traffic control threshold is defined to enable the operator for proactive regulation of the huge M2M traffic to avoid network congestion as well as to minimise the impact on H2H traffic. We characterize the proposed scheduling algorithm via a mathematical analysis for the metrics such as average length of the H2H queue, average length of the M2M queue, average waiting time of H2H packets, and average waiting time of M2M packets. We compare the performance of E-CBDP algorithm with some recent solutions in terms of average delay, percentage of packets dropped, aggregate throughput, fairness, and energy consumption. Simulation results show that E-CBDP algorithm demonstrates excellent performance in terms of packet drop rate and fairness while provides satisfactory performance in terms of delay, throughput, and energy consumption. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In this investigation polycarbonate (PC) nanocomposites (NC) films have been fabricated with varying amounts of alluminosilicate nanotubes (HNT) using solvent intercalation method. On the basis of UV–Vis experiments, the effect of HNT on absorption coefficient spectra of PC/HNT NC films is demonstrated. A distinct reduction of band gap energy is being a result of HNT doping which leads to the formation of charge transfer complexes (CTC) and π-conjugation between HNT and PC matrix. Further absorption bands and absorption edge parameters such as Urbach energy (Eu) and energy gap (Eg) are used to evaluate the changes in the NC films. The structural and morphological aspects of PC/HNT NC were evaluated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-Ray diffraction studies and scanning electron microscopy. Absorbance and transmittance spectra of luminescent PC/HNT NC films reveals the conversion of higher energy UVA light in to lower energy visible light which leads to efficient photovoltaic application. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={There is great value to use of structural neuroimaging in the assessment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, to date, predictive value of structural imaging tend to range between 80% and 90% in accuracy and it is unclear why this is the case given that structural imaging should parallel the pathologic processes of AD. There is a possibility that clinical misdiagnosis relative to the gold standard pathologic diagnosis and/or additional brain pathologies are confounding factors contributing to reduced structural imaging classification accuracy. We examined potential factors contributing to misclassification of individuals with clinically diagnosed AD purely from cortical thickness measures. Correctly classified and incorrectly classified groups were compared across a range of demographic, biological, and neuropsychological data including cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, amyloid imaging, white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume, cognitive, and genetic factors. Individual subject analyses suggested that at least a portion of the control individuals misclassified as AD from structural imaging additionally harbor substantial AD biomarker pathology and risk, yet are relatively resistant to cognitive symptoms, likely due to “cognitive reserve,” and therefore clinically unimpaired. In contrast, certain clinical control individuals misclassified as AD from cortical thickness had increased WMH volume relative to other controls in the sample, suggesting that vascular conditions may contribute to classification accuracy from cortical thickness measures. These results provide examples of factors that contribute to the accuracy of structural imaging in predicting a clinical diagnosis of AD, and provide important information about considerations for future work aimed at optimizing structural based diagnostic classifiers for AD. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Aspect ratio (shape) of the filler is one of the key factors which play a vital role in determining the properties of the composites. Fillers like talc and calcium carbonate (CaCO3) have different aspect ratios and affect the properties differently. This study was carried out to investigate the effect of aspect ratio of the filler on the properties of the acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) polymer. The rheological, mechanical, thermal properties, and fracture morphology were studied for the ABS composites filled with talc and CaCO3 at various filler loading. Coupling agent was added to improve the interfacial adhesion between the filler and the ABS matrix. The aspect ratio of fillers affected the flow behavior at lower shear rate, and was insignificant at higher shear rates. The flow-induced morphology was more effective in case of talc giving a significant increase in the bending modulus. Tensile and flexural strength showed a slight decrease in the values with talc showing better performance as compared to CaCO3. The reverse was observed in case of impact strength, with CaCO3 showing lower drop in the values. Aspect ratio of filler had no significant effect on the thermal properties of the composites. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 2018, 135, 46023. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Polyurethane (PU) based green composites with varying amounts of ginger spent (GS) have been fabricated and characterized for swelling and molecular transport behaviors in n-alkane probe molecules. Sorption–desorption–resorption–redesorption (S-D-RS-RD) behaviors have been performed to determine the true factor for transport coefficient. Sorption results are obtained by a gravimetric method and diffusion coefficient (D) has been calculated using Fick's equation for the linear data points of time-dependent sorption/resorption curves. The observation was made that diffusion coefficient follows Fick's rule. Sorption studies have been carried out at 25, 40, and 60°C. A significant increase in sorption values has been noticed with raise in temperature. Sorption (S) and diffusion (D) coefficients of n-alkanes depend on GS content in PU matrix. From the temperature dependence of diffusion and permeation (P) coefficients, the Arrhenius activation parameters have been used to estimate activation parameters such as diffusion (ED) and permeation (EP). Thermodynamic parameters such as enthalpy (ΔH) and entropy (ΔS) have been interpreted for sorption/resorption results. The percentage weight change for desoption and redesorption processes has been recorded; these results depend on the volatility of the penetrant molecules. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The glass transition temperature (Tg) of the fabricated PU/SPI composites has been evaluated by differential scanning calorimeter. Thermal stability and degradation analysis of the PU/SPI composites have been performed using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA). TGA thermograms clearly revealed that the fabricated composites were thermally stable upto 181°C and show a three-step of thermal degradation. The water uptake behaviors of PU/SPI systems have been studied at different chemical environments such as distilled water, salt solution, acidic and alkaline solutions. The microcrystalline parameters such as crystallite size (〈N〉) and surface weighted crystal size (Ds) have been evaluated from wide-angle X-ray scattering profiles using two different asymmetric distribution functions. PU/SPI green composites were subjected to biodegradation in the presence of Aspergillus niger. The structure–property response of the PU/SPI green composites has been established on the basis of these parameters. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Nanoparticles (NPs) are currently being investigated along with the use of biodegradable polymer containing active agents in many areas of medicine for targeted applications. The present study was aimed to synthesize novel compound Benzodioxane midst piperazine (BP) and characterization of a BP decorated chitosan silver nanoparticles (BP*C@AgNPs) and shown effective against hazardous pathogens, and also having anti-inflammatory property. It was further evaluated for molecular docking proofs, and toxicity. The BP*C@AgNPs had spherical shape with size of 36.6 nm with wide biocidal activity against hazardous Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria with excellent inhibition at 100 μg/mL for S. aureus (10.08 ± 0.05 mm ZOI), and E. coli (10.03 ± 0.04 mm ZOI) compared to antibiotic Streptomycin. The anti-inflammatory activity exhibited IC50 value of 71.61 ± 1.05 μg/mL for BP*C@AgNPs compared to indomethacin (IC50 = 40.15 ± 1.21 μg/mL). Also, the docking study of BP showed excellent score for COX1 and DNA gyrase. This in silico study confirmed the achieved efficacy of BP, with less toxicity against normal PMBCs in vitro and in vivo studies. This study concludes that, the novel synthesized BP*C@AgNPs had excellent biocidal property and as anti-inflammatory candidate revealed by docking studies, it confirms BP*C@AgNPs for first-class therapeutic applications in the area of medicinal nanotechnology for the coming days. © 2017},

abstract={This work presents an approach for identification of Raga of Flute music. Identification of Raga plays a vital role in learning about the rules in playing a composition, determining the valid Swaras, tunes and deflections. Experts can identify the Raga easily, learners cannot. The earlier works in this direction have dealt with Human Voice and simple Musical Instruments other than Flute, which could not address the versatility of source instrument or the Vocalist. In this work, application of Spectrogram for Raga analysis has been proposed which addresses the issues in the existing methods. The performance evaluation of the proposed method was evaluated on a database consisting of 32 Ragas using the statistical measures such as True Positive (TP), True Negative (TN), False Positive (FP) and False Negative (FN). The test consists of 40 samples with complete scale of each raga and obtained TP of 90%, FN of 0%, TN of 100% and FP of 10%. Hence, the Accuracy of the proposed method is 95%. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={An efficient and compact representation of the speech properties offers potential benefits in discriminating stuttering dysfluencies. The presence of dysfluencies in speech causes variation in vocal tract structure and articulatory moments. The Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) acoustic feature representing the vocal tract characteristics have been widely used in speaker and speech recognition applications. MFCC emphasizes on the short-term spectral properties of the signal and suppresses the essential information of temporal behavior. However, the combination of spectral and temporal information is essential for human perception of speech. In this paper, a new Linear Prediction-Hilbert transform based MFCC (LH-MFCC) feature extraction technique has been proposed to capture the temporal, instantaneous amplitude and frequency characteristics of speech. The proposed LH-MFCC enhances the perception nature of conventional MFCC and thereby improves its discrimination ability. The applicability of these vocal tract features is studied in the context of stuttering dysfluency classification. Comparative analyses of MFCC and LH-MFCC for three types of dysfluencies have been demonstrated. The LH-MFCC has shown improved performance in all dysfluency classification experiments. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Data links which flow in sequential manner for communication in global manner on chips or IC's have evolved and given birth to lot of investigations in recent times. As a result of this evolution lately it was proved that serial link communication gives major advantage over multi-bit or parallel communication with respect to reduce problems likeskew, jitter, area, cost, wiring problem and clock synchronization. The reason behind choosing of serial or sequential link over multi bit is to reduce or cut down routing congestion and complexity in the design issues. This will bring down major part of power consumption which occurs due to enhanced switching rate in the chips. This paper distinguishes a new bit regularization scheme in order to scale down data switching action with in the serial links with an assumption that statistical information of the data bits on the parallel data links is known is priori. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={For the study of anatomical structure and image processing of MRI medical images techniques of noise removal have become an important practice in medical imaging application. In medical image processing, precise images need to be obtained to get accurate observations for the given application. The goal of any de-noising technique is to remove noise from an image which is the first step in any image processing. The noise removal method should be applied watchful manner otherwise artefacts can be introduced which may blur the image. In this paper, performance evaluation of the of MRI image de-noising techniques is provided. The techniques used are namely the median and Gaussian filter, Max filter [11], Min filter [11], and Arithmetic Mean filter [8]. All the above filters are applied on MRI brain and spinal cord images and the results are noted. A new method is proposed which modifies the existing median filter by adding features. The experimental result of the proposed method is then analyzed with the other three image filtering algorithms. The output image efficiency is measured by the statistical parameters like root mean square error (RMSE), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Sentiment analysis or opinion mining is an automated process to recognize opinion, moods, emotions, attitude of individuals or communities through natural language processing, text analysis, and computational linguistics. In recent years, many studies concentrated on numerous blogs, tweets, forums and consumer review websites to identify sentiment of the communities. The information retrieved from social networking site will be in short informal text because of limited characters in blogging site or consumer review websites. Sentiment analysis in short-text is a challenging task, due to limitation of characters, user tends to shorten his/her conversation, which leads to misspellings, slang terms and shortened forms of words. Moreover, short-texts consists of more number of presence and absence of term/feature compared to regular text. In this work, our major goal is to classify sentiments into positive, negative or neutral polarity using new similarity measure. The proposed method embeds modified Similarity Measure for Text Processing (mSMTP) with K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated by comparing with Euclidean Distance, Cosine Similarity, Jaccard Coefficient and Correlation Coefficient. The proposed method is also compared with other classifiers like Support Vector Machine and Random Forest using benchmark dataset. The classification results are evaluated based on Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F-measure. © Association for Computing Machinery. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Background: Periodically assessment of the healing process of diabetic wound is a very important task for clinicians. The quantitative analysis of wound is useful to monitor and evaluate the healing process with the intervention of drug therapies. Currently, the evaluation process focuses mainly on visual inspection, which is not accurate enough to accomplish the task. Methods: Segmentation and detection of region of the wound in tissues is an emerging field for assessing the healing process. This paper presents the supervised learning methods to detect and classify the type of wound tissues. Fast Fuzzy C-means and K-means clustering algorithms has been implemented for classifying and detecting the boundary of wounds and also the size of the wound has been measured from images. Results: The intensity of the images has been normalized, and wounds were segmented in five images collected from the open source database. The output result shows that the boundary of the wound has been extracted accurately by both the methods. The enhanced Fast Fuzzy C-means provides better visual segmented output compared K-means process in terms of high PSNR and low MSE values. The high PSNR of 55.57 is measured in EnFuzzy C-means compared to K-means algorithm with a value of 54.74 and the effectiveness of the process has also been calculated by integrating both the process. Conclusion: These methods may be useful in accessing and analyzing the wound healing process in qualitative and quantitative manner in diabetic cases. © 2018 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={This paper summarises the results of the Sclera Segmentation and Eye Recognition Benchmarking Competition (SSERBC 2017). It was organised in the context of the International Joint Conference on Biometrics (IJCB 2017). The aim of this competition was to record the recent developments in sclera segmentation and eye recognition in the visible spectrum (using iris, sclera and peri-ocular, and their fusion), and also to gain the attention of researchers on this subject. In this regard, we have used the Multi-Angle Sclera Dataset (MASD version 1). It is comprised of2624 images taken from both the eyes of 82 identities. Therefore, it consists of images of 164 (82×2) eyes. A manual segmentation mask of these images was created to baseline both tasks. Precision and recall based statistical measures were employed to evaluate the effectiveness of the segmentation and the ranks of the segmentation task. Recognition accuracy measure has been employed to measure the recognition task. Manually segmented sclera, iris and peri-ocular regions were used in the recognition task. Sixteen teams registered for the competition, and among them, six teams submitted their algorithms or systems for the segmentation task and two of them submitted their recognition algorithm or systems. The results produced by these algorithms or systems reflect current developments in the literature of sclera segmentation and eye recognition, employing cutting edge techniques. The MASD version 1 dataset with some of the ground truth will be freely available for research purposes. The success of the competition also demonstrates the recent interests of researchers from academia as well as industry on this subject. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Assessment of wound in diabetes patient is essential step in the management of therapeutic intervention. The objective of this work is to improve the accuracy of segmenting the diabetic wound and assessment of diabetic wound healing process by incorporating the proposed method of improved watershed segmentation by flooding and pruning technique. The technique has been proposed in concatenation with pruning. The process of pruning helps us to avoid the problem of over-segmentation. The over-segmentation can be avoided by recognizing the set of pixels, which exhibit the properties of segmentation. The properties of segmentation include flooding and receiving the flooded response with the neighboring pixels of an image. The flooding with pruning helps in estimating the boundary of an object and assesses the regions of segmented image. Further, the objects of an image are processed with the morphological operations like erosion and dilation to improve the accuracy of the proposed method. The Proposed method has been designed with an improved watershed algorithm to assess the segmented objects and to boost an algorithm during the process of avoiding over-segmentation. The efficacy of this proposed method can be visualized from the proposed algorithm. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={In Wireless Mesh Networks, nodes often have a limited battery supply to use for the sending and reception of transmissions. By allowing nodes to relay messages for other nodes, the distance that needs to be bridged can be reduced, thus limiting the energy needed for a transmission. However, the number of transmissions a node needs to perform increases costing more energy. Power-aware routing refers to the mechanism of taking into account the remaining battery capacity of the node in order to decide on whether or not to relay traffic. The usage of nodes having low capacity should be avoided for relaying traffic. Efficient routing algorithm is used to find out cheapest route ie, based on number of hops within a mesh network. This refers to high load on some nodes, that in turn refer to uneven battery discharge over the nodes. So power aware routing is based on the amount of battery a node is having. In this paper, we present the related works on lowest consumption of energy, Tools used to simulate, we provide a comparative analysis. Finally we present the challenges in power-save routing algorithms in Wireless Mesh Networks. © 2012 FRUCT.},

abstract={Quality plays a very important role in today's highly competitive industrial environment. Quality leads to an improvement in the productivity. Quality control tools are used to solve more than 90% of the problems faced by the organizations in improving its effectiveness and meeting the customer expectation on a continuous basis. The success of the quality control procedure depends greatly on the method of data collection and its accuracy. Quality control tools are used worldwide in manufacturing industries for continual improvement and are implemented in different steps of manufacturing process to define the problem, measure its impact, finding out its root cause and its removal to ensure the production of non-defective items. The present work includes collection of failure data of intermix and dump mill of a tyre manufacturing unit located in Karnataka. The failure data collected for one year has been analysed to find out the major causes of breakdown. Quality control tools such as Pareto chart, Bar chart, Histogram, Fish bone diagram have been used to find out the root causes and identifying the action plans to eradicate them. Reliability assessment (theoretical) of intermix and dump mill has been conducted using the failure data. The reliability and maintainability curves speak about the present state of working of maintenance department in regard to addressing of breakdown problems and also help in setting future working standards. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.},

In this paper we present an innovative application in the field of remote health monitoring using N900 Nokia tablet, which will serve as a communicating device between the patient and healthcare providers like doctors and nurses. Patients with arthritis require regular objective monitoring of their affected joints by healthcare providers requiring that patients report their subjective pain levels to their physicians. The application has a patient's module allowing the patient to select their pain level on a sliding scale from a graphical representation of various human joints and send this as an SMS to the doctor. The healthcare providers can review the pain level, save it to a database and make an informed decision about possible recommendations based on the data received via SMS. The doctor's module allows the doctor to capture all the attributes of an affected joint discretely using the graphical representation of the joints and associated dialog boxes. The complete Graphical User Interface (GUI) development and data base design are discussed and test cases are presented. We plan to evaluate the application in a real healthcare environment for usability, its role in improving patient satisfaction and health outcomes. © 2012 FRUCT.},

abstract={Presently, a variety of biometric modalities are applied to perform human identification or user verification. Unimodal biometric systems (UBS) is a technique which guarantees authentication information by processing distinctive characteristic sequences and these are fetched out from individuals. However, the performance of unimodal biometric systems restricted in terms of susceptibility to spoof attacks, non-universality, large intra-user variations, and noise in sensed data. The Multimodal biometric systems defeat various limitations of unimodal biometric systems as the sources of different biometrics typically compensate for the inherent limitations of one another. The objective of this article is to analyze various methods of information fusion for biometrics, and summarize, to conclude with direction on future research proficiency in a multimodal biometric system using ECG, Fingerprint and Face features. This paper is furnished as a ready reckoner for those researchers, who wish to persue their work in the area of biometrics. © 2016 Authors.},

abstract={This paper explores image enhancement techniques for robust sclera segmentation. The sclera segmentation is a primary step in sclera based human recognition. The performance of sclera recognition system depends on the accurate sclera segmentation. Unfortunately, the results of sclera segmentation deteriorate due to the acquisition of blurred or dark nature of input image. To improve the sclera segmentation results, this paper explores two well-known image enhancement techniques i.e., Histogram Equalization (HE) and Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE). The efficacy of the image enhancement techniques are evaluated using segmentation results obtained by K-Means and Fuzzy C-Means. The experimentations are carried out on standard benchmark Sclera Segmentation and Recognition Benchmarking Competition (SSRBC2015) dataset. The Experimental results reveal that the image enhancement method improves the sclera segmentation results to the best extent. © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The present research work describes the use of photodynamic therapy (PDT) of drug 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) conjugated with microbial synthesised silver nanoparticles on skin melanoma (B16F10) and epidermoid carcinoma (A431) cell lines. Silver nanoparticles were synthesised using the bacterial strain Bacillus licheniformis. The morphology of the nanoparticles was studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and elemental analysis of nanoparticles was carried out using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis was performed to assess the functional groups of the nanoparticles. Crystalline nature of nanoparticles was assessed using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD).The cytotoxicity of pure nanoparticles and conjugated nanoparticles with 5-ALA using polyethylene glycol (PEG) was assessed on B16F10 and A431 cell lines and also compared with standard 5-ALA. Production of ROS molecules was measured using a 2,7-dichlorofluorescein-diacetate (DCFH-DA) probe. The results showed that the 5-ALA-silver nanoparticles conjugate had higher cytotoxicity on both the cell lines than the pure ALA and silver nanoparticles. Antimicrobial activity of silver nanoparticles was also carried out on food borne pathogens and nanoparticles showed comparable antimicrobial activity with standard antibiotics. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={The factors associated with branding were identified beneath communication/marketing remit. There existed no difference between the employer brand and consumer brand. Companies who had strong product/ service brand would de facto be attractive to potential employees. Today, companies require blended capabilities. Ultimately, it is the personal experience of the relationship that a person develops within an organization that determines the longevity and win-win consummation of association. An extended concept of relationship marketing principle is Employer branding. An endeavor has been made through this research with an objective to identify the Employer Branding Dimensions (EBD) in selected Information technology firms located in Bangalore from existing employee perspective. Study has been executed using structured questionnaire with Information Technology (IT) employees as respondents from various companies like, Infosys, IBM, NTT DATA, Marvell technologies, JDA software solutions. Data thus collected is analysed using software package and considering the factor loadings, key dimensions (factors) that constituted the Employer branding. The findings of the study emphasize that relationship among dimensions constituting individual employer branding highlights the complexity in its significance as no individual factor has dominant influence on Employer Branding. But many factors in combination acts on branding. © 2018 Authors.},

abstract={Nowadays, traffic density is very high in most of the urban areas, because of the increase in the number of vehicles. Traffic congestion is a very common problem that leads to more lay-out time in traffic. In order to address this issue, an algorithm has been proposed in this work for traffic flow monitoring and analysis in real time based on image processing techniques. This paper describes a method of real time area and frame based traffic density estimation using edge detection for intelligent traffic control system. Area occupied by the edges of vehicles will be considered to estimate traffic density. The system will automatically estimate the traffic density of each road by calculating the area occupied by traffic which in turn will help to determine the duration of each traffic light. The main role of this study lies in the development of a new technique that detects traffic density according to the area occupied by the edges of vehicles for controlling traffic congestion. The proposed algorithm was evaluated on a 30 s video dataset which was sampled into 8 frames and yielded an average accuracy of 98.07%. This is comparable with the existing algorithms in the literature. Copyright © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={A sequential learning framework for text categorization based on Meta-cognitive Neural Network (McNN) is presented in this paper. Initially text documents are pre-processed and represented in the form of Term Document Matrix (TDM). Since the TDM is of high dimension, to reduce it to lower dimension Regularized Locality Preserving Indexing (RLPI) is used. Further, to categorize the text document, Meta-cognitive Neural Network (McNN) classifier is employed. To measure the effectiveness of the proposed framework, various experiments are conducted on standard benchmark Reuters-21578 dataset and used leave one out cross validation technique to assess the performance. The proposed framework performance is investigated against two well known neural network based classifiers: MLP (Multi Layer Perceptron) and RBF-NN (Radial Basis Function-Neural Network). The experimental results reveals that the McNN classifier uses less number of training documents for learning and it has less true error rate than other two neural network classifiers. © 2018 The Authors.

abstract={In this paper, a novel Region of Interest (ROI) based 2-Dimensional (2D) compression of ECG signals using JPEG2000 compression standard is proposed. Because of its high efficiency JPEG2000 is the global benchmark for compression of stationary images. This work is to illustrate that the JPEG2000 compression technique is not only restricted to compress images but also it can be applied to compress ECG signals. First the one dimensional ECG signal is transformed to 2D representation or image to explore the correlation among the samples and among the beats. This necessitates few steps that includes QRS detection and arrangement of QRS complex at relative position, Period sorting, mean extension, period normalization, amplitude normalization and locating ROI. Then this resultant 2D ECG data array is compressed using JPEG2000. The ROI region is extracted by applying the Otsu thresholding and the vertical projection profile on the resultant 2D ECG data. The core idea in this work is to compress the ROI region at low compression rate and non-ROI region at high compression rate. The proposed method is evaluated on the selected data from MITs Beth Israel hospital and it was conceded that this method surpasses some of the prevailing methods in the literature by attaining a higher Compression Ratio (CR) and moderate Percentage root- mean square difference (PRD). © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.},

abstract={In recent internet era, micro-blogging sites produce enormous amount of short textual information, which appears in the form of opinions or sentiments of users. Sentiment analysis is a challenging task in short text, due to use of formal language, misspellings, and shortened forms of words, which leads to high dimensionality and sparsity. In order to deal with these challenges, this paper proposes a novel, simple, and yet effective feature selection method, to select frequently distributed features related to each class. In this paper, the feature selection method is based on class-wise information, to identify the relevant feature related to each class. We evaluate the proposed feature selection method by comparing with existing feature selection methods like chi-square (χ2), entropy, information gain, and mutual information. The performances are evaluated using classification accuracy obtained from support vector machine, K nearest neighbors, and random forest classifiers on two publically available datasets viz., Stanford Twitter dataset and Ravikiran Janardhana dataset. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed feature selection method, we conducted extensive experimentation by selecting different feature sets. The proposed feature selection method outperforms the existing feature selection methods in terms of classification accuracy on the Stanford Twitter dataset. Similarly, the proposed method performs competently equally in terms of classification accuracy compared to other feature selection methods in most of the feature subsets on Ravikiran Janardhana dataset. ©2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2018.},

abstract={This paper presents an robust and efficient unsupervised method for ECG arrhythmia classification. The proposed method consists of two steps: feature selection and clustering. In proposed method, initially the input ECG data is fed into feature selection method to reduce the dimensionality. In this paper, three well known feature selection methods i.e., Principal Component Analysis, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Regularized Locality Preserving Indexing (RLPI) are employed. Further, the reduced data is clustered using a Robust Spatial Kernel FCM (RSKFCM) method. RSKFCM is variant of FCM method which uses Gaussian kernel as distance metric and incorporates neighborhood information. To evaluate the proposed method the experimentation's are conducted on UCI arrhythmia dataset and compared the results with traditional FCM and Kernel Fuzzy C-Means (KFCM). Extensive experimental results show that, the proposed RSKFCM method with RLPI feature selection method outperforms other methods in comparison. © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In recent decades, social media sites such as twitter, facebook, and review site produces huge number of textual information posted by many users. The user tends to express his/her sentiment in the form of sarcastic utterances. The sarcastic utterance usually shifts the polarity of text from negative to positive and likewise. The automatic classification of sarcastic utterances present in text is a very challenge task. It requires a system that can manage to detect content based text properties or features present in sarcastic utterances. In this regard, the paper propose a novel approach to classify sarcastic text using content based feature selection method. The proposed approach consists of two stage feature selection method to select most representative features. In first stage, conventional feature selection methods such as CHI-square, Information Gain (IG) and Mutual Information (MI) are used to select relevant features subset. The selected feature subset are further refined using second stage. In second stage, k-means clustering algorithm is used to select most representative feature among similar features. The selected features are classified using two classifiers Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF).

abstract={In recent decades, microblogs generate large volumes of data in the form of short text. Twitter has been one of the most widely used microblogging sites. Twitter data consist of noise due to shortness, which need to be preprocessed to find the accurate sentiment expressed by the user. The major challenges in short texts are the presence of noisy data like URLs, misspelling, slang words, repeated characters, punctuation, etc. To handle these challenges, this paper proposes to combine various preprocessing techniques with different classification methods as a tool for Twitter sentiment analysis. We evaluated the effect of noisy data like URLs, hashtags, negations, repeated characters, punctuations, stopwords and stemming. We use n-gram representation model to find the bindings and further applied support vector machine (SVM) and K-nearest neighbors (KNN) multi-class classifiers for sentiment classification.

abstract={Parkinson's disease (PD) has affected millions of people worldwide and is more prevalent in people, over the age of 50. Even today, with many technologies and advancements, early detection of this disease remains a challenge. This necessitates a need for the machine learning-based automatic approaches that help clinicians to detect this disease accurately in its early stage. Thus, the focus of this research paper is to provide an insightful survey and compare the existing computational intelligence techniques used for PD detection. To save time and increase treatment efficiency, classification has found its place in PD detection. The existing knowledge review indicates that many classification algorithms have been used to achieve better results, but the problem is to identify the most efficient classifier for PD detection. The challenge in identifying the most appropriate classification algorithm lies in their application on local dataset. Thus, in this paper three types of classifiers, namely, Multilayer Perceptron, Support Vector Machine and K-nearest neighbor have been discussed on the benchmark (voice) dataset to compare and to know which of these classifiers is the most efficient and accurate for PD classification. The Voice input dataset for these classifiers has been obtained from UCI machine learning repository. ANN with Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm was found to be the best classifier, having highest classification accuracy (95.89%). Moreover, we compared our results with those obtained by Resul Das [“A comparison of multiple classification methods for diagnosis of Parkinson Disease,” Expert Systems and applications, vol. 37, pp 1568–1572, 2010]. © 2018, © 2018 IETE.},

Among them the metal matrix composites are unique because of their superior properties.The manufacturing of carbon fiber reinforced Aluminum Metal Matrix Composites [AMMCs] involves the formation of a brittle intermetallic phase due to the reaction taking place at the fiber-matrix interface at temperatures exceeding 700°C. To avoid this undesired chemical reaction that ultimately results in the degradation of composite properties, the reinforcement is coated with nickel by electro less process. This paper describes the Electroless Nickel [EN] coating process carried out on PAN based short carbon fibers.

abstract={Only 40 lakh units of blood is available out of about 4 crore units of blood in each year in the nation. The direct contact donor and the recipient is not offered by many of the blood banks. This is critical when there is an emergency in need of blood. This aims to provide a direct link between the donor and the recipient. In this paper the blood donation management system (BDMS) which a web based application, which helps to manage the record of donors. Through web interface a blood bank database is created. In a central server the collected data is stored. Mobile application is used for sending notification via text message by using bulk message dispatch technique for providing the communication between the donor and the recipient. The recipient can also contact the donor with the help of the contact details available. Blood donors can also be searched from the mobile application, it is accessible only for registered members. The focus is to find the blood donors in an emergency situation and to provide direct link between the donor and the recipient. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Speech is essential to exchange information. Speech recognition is one of the interfaces for man-machine interaction. However, the performance of these systems is restricted to noisy acoustic conditions. Silent speech i.e. visual dynamic features of speech have more potential information for Human-Computer Interaction. This paper presents lip localization and segmentation by Otsu algorithm. The height and width parameters of lip movements are captured as visual cues for silent speech recognition. We develop stochastic visual word models with an in-house database of 20 subjects.

abstract={An empirical analysis of the various machine learning classifiers on Asthma data and their performance assessment are presented. As an integral part of preprocessing the data, feature reduction and outlier detection are carried out, following which classifiers are applied to the same to distinguish asthmatic subjects from those of non-asthmatic ones. In cases where the classifiers perform poorly, their performance is boosted via adaptive classifiers. Feature ranking is adopted to reduce the number of features that are considered for the final process of classification while support vector machine with radial basis function is deployed to eliminate outliers. The performance is evaluated via cross validation and random sampling with variable training sizes. The various performance metrics evaluated for the system including precision, recall, F1-measure and classification accuracy indicate good results.

abstract={The main objective of this work is to propose High Voltage Distribution System (HVDS) method as an effective approach for improving the voltage profile and reducing the power loss in a power distribution system. Secondly to justify that the proposed method is both technically feasible and economically viable approach for reducing the distribution system losses and also to maintain the voltage profile in distribution system. A software application has been developed using JAVA for pre and post implementation analysis. The process of backward-forward iteration technique for power loss calculation, annual energy savings and pay-back period has been developed. The analysis indicates that, HVDS is an effective and economically feasible approach for distribution system loss reduction and voltage profile improvement for tail end consumers. The problem to supply electricity to the end users with minimum losses in developing countries like India is a big challenge, where about 72% of human resources are inhabited in rural areas. Though investment is made at distribution side, it has not gained much technical impact when compared to generation and transmission systems. The losses in distribution networks are considerably high as the power distribution is done using Low Voltage Distribution System (LVDS). The losses are high in rural areas when compared to urban areas because of the widely spread loads, specially the agricultural loads. To overcome all these problems HVDS method is proposed as a best move to enhance the overall efficiency of the Distribution System. A case study analysis of BESCOM’s HVDS scheme is presented in this paper using the developed JAVA based program. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={During capturing documents using camera or camera phone and scanning the documents, document skew is unavoidable. Skew in line and paragraph of handwritten document is varying for different people. Document analysis and character recognition efficiency is mainly depending on document pre-processing, document skew correction. Document skew detection and correction is one of the difficult step before document analysis. In this paper we proposing multi-level Run-Length-Smoothed Image (RLSA) skew detection and correction for kannada hand written document image. We have major two sections, first section is pre-processing techniques like Haar wavelet decomposition, maximum gradient, 4, 8 connective Laplacian methods to extract text region without losing data. Second section is multi-level skew detection, horizontal and vertical projection profile are used to detect the page boarder and further RLSA skew detection is applied to find skew angle and rotate document by desired angle, this removes the document skew occurred while capturing the image. Later, the skewed document will be further processed to remove line and paragraph skew angle by applying RLSA skew detection technique for each segmented line and rotate each line by desired angle. Performance of proposed system is performed for kannada hand written documents; the experimental results are discussed; the proposed system is encouraging. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.},

abstract={In recent years SCC has found wide application because of its ability to completely fill the densest of formwork by consolidating under its own weight. This concern to maintain the fresh property is the basis for most of the mix proportioning methodologies suggested in the literature. In this paper a simple procedure, by slight modification to IS 10262:2009, is established, taking into consideration the compressive strength and not exceeding the limits prescribed by EFNARC. Initially 25 mix proportions with varying water and slag content were cast to establish a relationship between the water to cementitious and compressive strength of SCC. Based on the preliminary analysis a simple mix design procedure is suggested, which takes into consideration the limits suggested by EFNARC. In this method a range of compressive strength varying from 25-60 MPa is aimed at. Based on the proposed mix design, six mixtures were tested to examine its validity. The fresh properties and concrete strength result obtained were in good agreement with the desired design strength. © The Indian Concrete Journal January 2018.},

abstract={Styrene–butadiene–styrene triblock copolymer (SBS) blends were prepared using different weight ratios of conducting polyaniline (PANI). Several electrical properties such as volume resistivity, dielectric constant, dissipation factor and alternating current conductivity of the blends were studied pointing to understand the influence of different parameters like PANI concentration, frequency, and temperature on these properties. The prepared materials present a slight reduction in volume resistivity as a function of temperature, being useful in conditions where the temperature control is hard. More than this, dielectric constant tests allowed inferring that among tested samples, the one filled with 45 wt % of PANI is potentially able to be used in the electromagnetic dissipation field. Finally, the alternating current tests allowed to prove that the electrical conduction of the blend is mainly dominated by ionic transportation. Therefore, prepared materials can be considered as a strategic, low-cost, environmentally friendly material which can be used in various border fields. © Souza Jr. F., Soares B., Silveira F., Renukappa N., Siddaramaiah, 2018.},

abstract={Carbon black (CB)/ high-density polyethylene (HDPE)/polyaniline (PAni) functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWNT) hybrid nanocomposites were prepared by the combined solution and melt-mixing process. The influence of PAni-MWNTs on the positive temperature coefficient (PTC) characteristics of hybrid nanocomposites have been studied. The experimental results showed that the hybrid nanocomposites with small amount of PAni-MWNTs (0.50-0.75 wt%) have good conductivity at room temperature & PTC intensity was increased dramatically. The increase is possible because of the interaction between PAni and MWNTs which facilitates the charge transfer process. A noticeable PTC intensity was observed for hybrid nanocomposites near the melting point of HDPE. This is due to the significant volume expansion near the melting point of the HDPE in the presence of PAni-MWNTs and a sudden increase in the resistivity due to the disconnection of the conductive paths. Further PTC reproducibility of hybrid nanocomposites was greatly improved by introducing PAni-MWNTs. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Triplex hybrid nanofiller (CaNiAl2O5) have been synthesized by sol-gel method and its nanocomposite (NC) films were incorporated with poly vinyl alcohol (PVA). The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to probe morphological behaviors and dispersion of CaNiAl2O5 in PVA matrix. In order to probe the microstructure X-ray diffraction (XRD) and FTIR were performed on PVA/CaNiAl2O5 NCs. Based on the results of both XRD and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), the average particle size of the CaNiAl2O5 lies in the range 7–15 nm. The current (I)–voltage (V) behaviors were studied using LCR-meter at room temperature. The dc-conductivity increases with increasing in both CaNiAl2O5 at different voltages. The dielectric constant exhibits higher values at lower frequency and increases with nanoparticle (NP) loading due to increase in polarization particles in polymer matrix. The ac conductivity tends to increase with increase frequency and NPs content. The cyclic voltammetric data indicate the NC with 8wt% NPs exhibit higher specific capacitance as compared with PVA. The optical constants of the NCs were evaluated from UV-Visible spectra. The band gap energies has a blue shift from 4.4 eV (PVA) to 2.8 eV (PVA/8wt% CaNiAl2O5), whereas refractive index (RI) and the optical conductivity of NCs increased with an increasing in NPs content. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={The machining of titanium has been understood to be challenging and costly due to its material properties such as low thermal conductivity, low modulus of elasticity, high strength at elevated temperatures and chemical reactivity. This work aims to study the effect of iron as a partial substitution along with cobalt binder as the tool material for machining of titanium alloy. In this work, iron-rich binder tool (WC-Co-Fe) and cobalt binder tool (WC-Co) samples were produced by powder metallurgy route using powders with a mean particle size of less than 0.5 µm. Next, the evaluation of mechanical properties and phase analysis were performed. Turning experiments were conducted at various cutting speeds, feed and depth of cut (DOC), to evaluate the effects of iron-rich binder on flank wear, cutting forces and cutting temperature.

abstract={Autophagy is a major protein degradation pathway capable of upholding cellular metabolism under nutrient limiting conditions, making it a valuable resource to highly proliferating tumour cells. Although the regulatory machinery of the autophagic pathway has been well characterized, accurate modulation of this pathway remains complex in the context of clinical translatability for improved cancer therapies. In particular, the dynamic relationship between the rate of protein degradation through autophagy, i.e. autophagic flux, and the susceptibility of tumours to undergo apoptosis remains largely unclear. Adding to inefficient clinical translation is the lack of measurement techniques that accurately depict autophagic flux. Paradoxically, both increased autophagic flux as well as autophagy inhibition have been shown to sensitize cancer cells to undergo cell death, indicating the highly context dependent nature of this pathway. In this article, we aim to disentangle the role of autophagy modulation in tumour suppression by assessing existing literature in the context of autophagic flux and cellular metabolism at the interface of mitochondrial function. We highlight the urgency to not only assess autophagic flux more accurately, but also to center autophagy manipulation within the unique and inherent metabolic properties of cancer cells. Lastly, we discuss the challenges faced when targeting autophagy in the clinical setting. In doing so, it is hoped that a better understanding of autophagy in cancer therapy is revealed in order to overcome tumour chemoresistance through more controlled autophagy modulation in the future. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Telehealth monitoring is an innovative process of synergising the benefits of information and communication technologies (ICT) and Internet of Things (IoT) to deliver healthcare services to remote, distant, and underserved regions. The objective of this study is to deliver healthcare services to patients outside the conventional settings by connecting the patient and healthcare providers with technology. As technologies for telehealth monitoring have become more advanced, they have become fully integrated into delivery of healthcare service. One of the most publicized telehealth services is the use of telemammography in the early diagnosis of breast cancer from remote and rural locations. Automated detection and classification of tumor in telemammographic images is of high importance for physicians for accurate prediction of the diseases. This study presents advances in telehealth services and also proposes novel telemammography system for early detection of breast cancer from remote and underserved areas. In this study, we have used efficient wavelet-based image processing techniques for preprocessing, detection, and enhancing the resolution of mammographic images. A detailed comparative analysis is performed to select the best classification model using different classification algorithms. We have used Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Networks, J48 decision trees, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbor classifier for classifying the tumor into three categories namely: benign, malignant, and normal. The classification is based on the area, volume, and boundaries of tumor masses. All the tumor features and classification methods are compared using Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, Precision, and Mean Square Error. Experimental results on the Mammographic Image Analysis Society (MIAS) database are found to give the best results when neural network classifier is used for classification of mammographic images. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.},

abstract={The present report demonstrates the development of a highly sensitive and selective electrochemical biosensor for catechol detection by immobilizing crude polyphenol oxidase (PPO) enzyme onto a graphite (Gr) electrode modified using graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) decorated with green synthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). The developed electrochemical sensor, Gr/GNRs/AgNPs/PPO, is characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques at each stage of its fabrication. Under the optimized conditions, the developed sensor showed excellent electrocatalytic activity towards the detection of catechol which is attributed to higher electron transfer rates induced due to incorporation of GNRs and AgNPs in the electrode matrix. The sensor exhibited a wide detection range (2-2300 mM) and low detection limit. The sensor also showed superior selectivity towards catechol detection in the presence of common interferents. Furthermore, the efficiency of the catechol biosensor in real sample analysis is validated by analyzing catechol in different tea samples. The results of electroanalysis in comparison with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) results showed good agreement suggesting that the developed GNR composite based catechol sensor is efficient enough to be employed in detection and quantification of catechol in real samples, particularly the analysis of tea samples. ©The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique 2018.},

abstract={Natural products are important leads in drug discovery. The search for effective plant-derived agents or their synthetic analogues has continued to be of interest to biologists and chemists for a long time. Herein, we have synthesized a novel compound, P1C, and P1C-Tit∗CAgNPs from chitosan; P1C is a precursor and an anti-inflammatory candidate, which has been validated by molecular docking studies. The synthesized P1C-Tit∗CAgNPs showed monodisperse, spherical, and cationic nature and antioxidant properties, protecting destabilization of the erythrocyte membrane by the azo compound 2,2′-azobis(2-amidinopropane)dihydrochloride (AAPH); the involvement of NPs as a protective agent for biomolecules, such as DNA and protein, followed by the treatment of NPs with AAPH was confirmed. The inhibition of cellular damage and leakage of cellular inflammatory agents was confirmed by AFM, SEM, TEM, SDS-PAGE, LDH, and PLA2 enzyme inhibition via in vitro studies. The anti-inflammatory property of P1C was further validated by in silico molecular docking studies and showed that, the P1C best pose aligned to PLA2 compared to standard drug. The significant anticancer property of P1C-Tit∗CAgNPs was confirmed against MCF7, U373, and C6 cancer cell lines. Thus, the present study highlights the synthesized P1C in P1C-Tit∗CAgNPs as a target PLA2-specific anti-inflammatory candidate, and further tuning of small and development-functionalized nanoparticles has a great future in medicine; hence, their clinical applications are warranted. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={This research establishes a relation between objective biomarkers of Parkinson's disease (PD) based on T1-weighted MRI scans and other clinical biomarkers. It shall aid doctors in identifying the onset and progression of PD among the patients. Voxel-based morphometry has been used for feature extraction from MRI scans. These extracted features are combined with biochemical biomarkers for dataset enrichment. A genetic algorithm is applied to this dataset to remove the redundancies and to obtain an optimal set of features. Subsequently, we used Self-adaptive resource allocation network (SRAN), extreme learning machine (ELM) and support vector machines (SVM) to classify different subjects. It is observed that SRAN classifier gave the best performance when compared with ELM and SVM. Finally, it is found that a variation of grey matter in Thalamus is responsible for PD.

abstract={In many physical and sports activity, knee joint encounters extreme level of stresses leading to traumatic injury. The menisci are located between the tibial plateau and femoral condyles. These menisci act to distribute body weight evenly across the knee joint. Any damage to menisci may lead to uneven weight distribution and cause the development of abnormal excessive forces leading to early damage of the knee joint. Menisci act as ‘shock absorbers’ between femur and tibia, and prevent the lateral movement of the joint when the knee is fully extended. It also helps to provide a lubricating effect on the knee joint, provides some degree of stability, and is essential for the normal biomechanics of the knee joint. The menisci are often injured, particularly during athletics. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the widely used imaging modality in detection of menisci injuries. There is a chance of missing visibility of menisci tears in MRI during diagnosis. In this work, image processing method based on seeded region growing is developed to detect and visualize menisci tears from MRI. The segmentation accuracy is evaluated using dice similarity coefficient (DSC). The developed method segments the menisci from knee joint MRI with good accuracy and visualizes the tears in different compartments of menisci. The developed method is helpful in treatment and surgery planning of knee joint injured patients. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.},

abstract={Use of nanomaterials as antimicrobial agents is gaining tremendous importance. In the present investigation, bimetallic nanoparticles were synthesized using an aqueous extract of Annona squamosa L. Initial confirmation was attenuated with a change in color of the reaction mixture and further confirmation was achieved with UV-Visible spectrophotometry which displayed absorbance peak between 500 and 700 nm. The possible role of phyto-components present in aqueous extract to mediate and stabilize nanoparticles was studied using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis which predicted the presence of hydroxyl, carboxyl and amide functional groups. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis revealed the crystalline nature of bimetallic nanoparticles. The morphological characteristics of bimetallic nanoparticles were studied using Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) which depicted the polydispersity of nanoparticles with myriad size and shapes. The antibacterial activity was assessed with well diffusion, minimal inhibitory concentration. The bimetallic nanoparticles were effective against tested human pathogens and Bacillus subtilis (MTCC 121) followed by Staphylococcus aureus (MTCC 7443), Escherichia coli (MTCC 7410) and Salmonella typhi (MTCC 7407). The obtained preliminary investigation is interesting for future studies to elucidate the mechanism of synthesis and the possible mode of action of bimetallic nanoparticles against the test pathogens. © 2018.},

abstract={In this work, a direct Z-scheme Cs2O-Bi2O3-ZnO heterostructure without any electron mediator is fabricated by a simple solution combustion route. Cs2O is chosen as a sensitizer to expand the light absorption range, and in addition, its conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) positions are suitable to construct a direct Z-scheme system with ZnO and Bi2O3. Structural and elemental analyses show clear evidence for heterostructure formation. The Z-scheme charge carrier migration pathway in Cs2O-Bi2O3-ZnO is confirmed by high resolution XPS and ESR studies. The fabricated heterostructure exhibits a good ability to split water to H2 and O2 under simulated sunlight irradiation without any sacrificial agents or co-catalysts and has excellent photostability. The apparent quantum efficiency of the optimized Cs2O-Bi2O3-ZnO heterostructure reaches up to 0.92% at 420 nm. The excellent efficiency of this fabricated heterostructure is attributed to the efficient charge carrier separation, the high redox potential of the CBM and VBM benefiting from a direct Z-scheme charge carrier migration pathway and the extended light absorption range. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={The growth of social media has been exponential in the recent years. Immense amount of data is being put out onto the public domain through social media. This huge publicly available data can be used for research and a variety of applications. The objective of this paper is to counter problems with the social media dataset, namely : short text nature - the limited quantity of text data (140 to 160 characters), continuous streaming nature, usage of short forms and modern slangs and increasing use of sarcasm in messages and posts. Sarcastic tweets can mislead data mining activities and result in wrong classification. This paper compares various classification algorithms such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree, Adaptive Boost, Logistic Regression and Gaussian Naïve Bayes to detect sarcasm in tweets from the Twitter Streaming API. The best classifier is chosen and paired with various pre-processing and filtering techniques using emoji and slang dictionary mapping to provide the best possible accuracy. The emoji and slang dictionary being the novel idea introduced in this paper. The obtained results can be used as input to other research and applications. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Concrete has today very demanding performance requirements. The concrete durability crisis which started to attract public attention forced the engineers to think about the performance of concrete. Proper mix design and careful construction using the best available materials and technologies are necessary to achieve quality concrete structures. In the last decade the use of Supplementary Cementing Materials (SCMs) has become an integral part of high strength and high performance concrete mix design. One of the important changes is the introduction of micro technology for concrete with fine and ultrafine cementitious materials. It is now possible to achieve excellent particle packing and thereby comply with the performance demands both in fresh and in the hardened states. In the present investigation the SCMs used are Flyash, Silica fume, Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag and Metakaoline which are recommended by IS 456:2000 to enhance the durability of concrete. This paper presents the performance of M30 to M90 grades of concrete with superplasticizer using Rapid Chloride Permeability Test. Suitable combinations of these SCMs can be used in practice to enhance the chloride resistance of standard to high grade concrete mixes.},

abstract={The disturbances created in AC transmission line power flow due to various faults and unavoidable natural circumstances have to be monitored carefully for uninterrupted power supply to the consumer and to avoid unacceptable situations. Voltage sag is one such unwanted disturbance occurring in the power system due to varying causes like lightning, loose connections, accidental short circuits, tree branches touching the line, birds hitting the line, etc., owing to non-recoverable damage to sensitive equipment in industries which also leads to financial losses. This paper proposes a new technique using DQ transform and integrator for fast voltage sag detection which is possible within 1/4th of a cycle and a new algorithm to identify the faulty phase. The authors are able to detect the voltage sag within the lowest time of 0.3ms for single-phase fault and 0.2ms for two-phase and three-phase faults. The simulation results for various types of power system faults with different point-on-waveform (POW) are presented using MATLAB/Simulink tool. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={Background: Quinazolines are a big family of heterocyclic compounds with anti-cancer properties. Objective: The latest investigation was on synthesis, characterization of novel 4-anilinoquinazoline derivatives for their anti-angiogenic effect. Method: A series of novel 4-anilino-6,7-dimethoxy quinazoline derivatives were synthesized and characterized using1H,13C NMR, FT-IR and LC-MS techniques. Cytotoxicity assays were performed for all compounds against different cell lines such as Human colon carcinoma (HCT116), Human chronic myeloid leukemia (K562) and Human breast cancer (SKBR3) cell lines using 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-Diphenyl tetrazolium Bromide (MTT), Trypan blue and Lactose dehydrogenase release assay. The selected compounds were evaluated for their anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic effect on EAC tumor model. The molecular docking studies were drawn using maestro 2D sketcher and energy minimize was compounded by OPLS 2005. Results: Among all compounds, RB4 and RB7 showed moderate activity whereas RB1 showed most potent activity comparable with that of the standard drug cisplatin against all three cell lines. RB1 also inhibited the proliferation of tumor cells in three different cell lines. Further, in-vivo studies revealed that RB1 significantly reduced secretion of ascites, tumor cell proliferation and increased the life span of tumor bearing mice. The antiangiogenic effect of RB1 was revealed from the reduced vessel sprouting in the peritoneum region of treated mice and induced avascular zone in chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model. The insilco molecular docking studies clearly demonstrate the dual inhibitory potential of RB1 against VEGFR-2 and EGFR from binding to the active site of its receptors. Conclusion: However these studies clearly show that RB1 might be a potent antitumor and anti-angiogenic agent representing a promising lead for further optimization and elucidation of the mechanism of action. © 2017 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={Fiber-reinforced laminated composites have excellent mechanical properties along the fiber in-plane direction. However, they do not have very good properties in the transverse direction. The objective of this research is to deal with this problem by using graphene oxide (GO), plasma-treated multiwall carbon nanotubes, and nanodiamond extra pure powder with epoxy-terminated butadiene nitrile liquid rubber to improve the through-thickness fracture toughness of glass/epoxy unidirectional pre-preg laminates. The experimental results show that by adding carbon nanoparticles with rubber in small quantities, the mode-I interlaminar critical energy release rate can be improved by 50 to 103 %. Furthermore, it was observed that there was an increase in flexural stiffness by 15 % with the addition of nanodiamond extra pure powder to rubber. However, when GO was used, the mode-I interlaminar fracture toughness improvement was reduced as compared to other nanoparticles modified by glass/epoxy fiber laminates. The fracture surfaces were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy to understand the increase in toughness in modified glass epoxy pre-peg laminate system. © 2017 by ASTM International.},

abstract={Background: The assessment of the nutritional composition and phytochemical screening of banana pseudostem (PB) and flower (FB) advocate this nonconventional food source for routine consumption, considering its various health benefits. Objectives: The aim is to assess the proximate nutrient composition, fatty acids, minerals, amino acid profile, and global antioxidant response (GAR) of PB and FB. Methods: Standard analytical procedures were used to determine the nutritional quality and GAR of PB and FB. Results: The chemical analysis illustrated that functional profile (water holding capacity, oil holding capacity, swelling power, and solubility), and proximate (ash, moisture, protein, fat, dietary fiber, and carbohydrate) contents were substantially high in FB than PB. With a well-proportionate amino acid profile, PB (0.56) and FB (0.54) comprised of a high ratio of essential to nonessential amino acids than those of FAO/WHO requirement (0.38). The mineral analysis revealed that PB and FB were rich in macro and micro minerals in the order K > Ca > Mg > P > Na and K > Mg > Na > Ca > P, respectively. Linoleic acid was found to be the major component in PB and FB. Besides, total antioxidant activity conducted for PB and FB by GAR method, measuring both bio-accessible and insoluble fractions, revealed that the soluble fraction fared better than the chemical extracts. Conclusion: The results revealed high nutritional qualities of the byproducts of banana and the low cost of its production promotes their use as a prospective nonconventional food resource with high nutraceutical value. © 2017 Pharmacognosy Research | Published by Wolters Kluwer-Medknow.},

The model utilizes the survey data that was recorded by the University of Innsbruck, Austria, collected during a study that was related to lung operation and diseases of the respiratory tracts. The model performs feature transformation and feature selection to identify significance of Asthma indicators which shall be treated as Asthma severity indicators. The dataset is pre-processed by standardizing data using normalizing techniques. The impact of pre-processing is verified by performing prediction of likely outcome of Asthma in subjects with the identified severity indicators. The Predictive performance of the model is analyzed by applying KNN classifier and Support Vector Machine techniques which yield considerably good results in terms of performance metrics like Precision, Recall and F-Measure. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={In the context of power system, power system stabilizer (PSS) plays a very important role for damping low frequency oscillations. In conventional techniques, the selection of feedback controllers for PSS is usually done by the pole placement, propotinal derivative (PD), proportional integrator (PI), combination of both PD & PI, lead lag compensators etc,. These conventional control methods simply make a system stable without optimizing anything. Inview of this the researchers across the globe are working for better optimized feedback controller for PSS. This paper presents the design of such an optimized feedback control techniques with different approaches for the single machine infinite bus (SMIB) linearized phillips heffron model of power system installed with PSS. To show the effectiveness of the proposed optimized feedback controllers the experiments are conducted to cover wide range of operating conditions by choosing the loads as light, normal & heavy. The effect of operating condition (type of load) on the performance of the proposed controller has been discussed. The proposed experiments with different optimal controllers are implemented using MATLAB/SIMULINK platform. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper proposes an efficient content based image retrieval using features derived from regions. The regions are sub divided in to sub regions. On each sub region local binary patterns (LBP) are derived. Each sub region is assigned a unique code if it forms a fundamental unit i.e. a uniform LBP (ULBP). The present paper derives a unique number for each region called as rank of region. The rank of the region is computed based on the number of ULBPs each sub region derives of that region. The present paper derived rank based region ULBP cooccurrence matrix (RR-ULBP-CM). The gray level cooccurrence matrix (GLCM) features are evaluated on RR-ULBP-CM for efficient image retrieval and experiments are performed using Corel data base. The proposed RR-ULBP-CM method is compared with the existing methods and results establishes the efficacy of the proposed method. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Efficient face recognition is one of the long standing problems of computer vision. Texture is an important spatial feature, useful for identifying facial objects of interest in an image. The most popular statistical methods used to measure the textural information of images are the grey level cooccurrence matrix (GLCM) and the texture spectrum (TS) Approach. The major problem of these two approaches is the dimensionality. This paper derives significant local information by deriving a new integrated matrix using fuzzy based texture unit and GLCM for efficient face recognition. The features derived from this integrated matrix provide detailed and complete texture information of about the human faces. Local binary pattern (LBP) operator is a powerful operator to extract the discriminative facial features and this method may fail to detect the illumination variation and facial expressions accurately. Noise is the crucial problem related to methods based on LBP also. To address these issues, the present paper derives a fuzzy logic on texture unit to discriminate the local information precisely than LBP and to reduce the dimensionality. The performance of the proposed scheme is validated using complex facial datasets, namely Yale and american telephone and telegraph company (AT&T). The present method is compared with methods based on LBP and the results indicate the efficacy of the proposed method. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={In the present study, dielectric and thermal properties of poly(aryl ether ketone) (PAEK)-nanocomposites with varying weight percentage of magnesium oxide (MgO) have been reported. The thermal properties of PAEK/MgO nanocomposites were studied using differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, thermo-mechanical analysis and thermal conductivity. Transmission electron microscopy of the developed nanocomposites shows agglomerate-free dispersion of MgO nanoparticles in PAEK matrix. From the dielectric properties, dielectric constant of 13 was achieved for 10 wt% PAEK/MgO nanocomposite at 230°C. Further, minimum tan δ and maximum volume resistivity were found for 10 wt% PAEK/MgO nanocomposite. Data from thermal studies indicate that the incorporation of MgO into PAEK significantly enhanced the glass transition temperature and slightly deteriorated the thermal stability, char yield, and flame-retardant properties. Also, highest thermal conductivity and lowest coefficient of thermal expansion were achieved at 10 wt% of the MgO content. An excellent combination of both dielectric and thermal properties of the PAEK/MgO nanocomposites developed in the present study finds its potential application in microelectronics and electrical insulation in power equipments. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.},

Position estimation method in WSN is used for estimating the location of an object from a group of noisy surroundings. To do so, this study is performed on different research works that are utilized currently in terms of attaining the qualified position or location estimation of the mobile nodes. The study is based on the merits and demerits of the techniques proposed and also using the parameters that project the performance of the system. In this analysis, the efficient position estimation techniques including SPCT, TOA based MLE, SA-CN, PLI, ML estimation and SOCP relaxation methods and IKF-GMD algorithms are presented and the performance of each technique is evaluated to determine the efficient position estimation technique. Comparisons are made on the evaluated protocols used in positioning techniques and it is proved that the IKFGMD technique and ML estimation and SOCP relaxation methods provide better performance for the position estimation in WSN.

abstract={Silver doped copper oxide (Ag0.5Cu0.75O) nanoparticles synthesized by hydrothermal growth process were introduced into PVA matrix in varying amounts viz., 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 wt% through solution intercalation method. The Ag0.5Cu0.75O nano filler induced structural and morphological changes in PVA were ascertained through X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopic analysis. While, the changes in optical and electrical behaviors such as optical band gap, refractive index, extinction co-efficient and current (I)–voltage (V) characteristics were established by various state of the art opto-electronic characterizations. The sensor performance was put through its pace by measuring the changes in current output of the composite films upon Escherichia coli exposure. The I–V measurements depicted 2 wt% as the optimum concentration of Ag0.5Cu0.75O nano fillers in PVA that achieved a device sensitivity of 23.85% for an E.Coli concentration of 1.25 × 108 cfu/ml. Under optimized conditions, the 2 wt% Ag0.5Cu0.75O/PVA based E.Coli sensor exhibited a lower detection limit of 102 cfu/ml and a response time of 6–8 s. The as prepared E.Coli sensor presents lower detection limit and lesser response time to be used for real-time operations. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

The aim of the present work is to evaluate the fuel properties and investigate the impact on engine performance using composite oil of Pongamia and waste cooking biodiesel of various proportions of 60:40, 70:30, 80:20 and their ternary blend with diesel of B10, B20, B30, B40. The result of the test showed that brake specific fuel consumption for composite oil of Pongamia biodiesel and waste cooking biodiesel 70:30 of blend B20 is higher than diesel due to their lower energy content compared to all other blends. The brake thermal efficiency of ternary blend and diesel is comparable while the Pongamia and waste cooking biodiesel have higher efficiency.

abstract={Background: Conventional periodontal therapy with various bone grafts has limited scope and the results are not predictable. To improve their utility, the hybridization of bioceramics and biodegradable polymers has been widely adopted to reform the mechanical properties of bone grafts. One such biodegradable polymer is POC (Poly 1,8 octanediol). Secondly, citric acid is considered as the key material in bone mineralization, which is related to the overall stability, strength and fracture resistance of bone. Hence citric acid is incorporated in a polymer and Nano hydroxyapatite to form a composite graft, for periodontal bone regeneration. This study attempts to evaluate the efficacy of citric acid based Nano-hydroxyapatite composite graft for the treatment of intrabony defects in chronic periodontitis patients over 12 months. Methods: A split mouth study, which consists of 10 systemically healthy patients, were randomly treated with Citric acid based Nano hydroxyapatite composite graft (test sites, n=18) or with Nano hydroxyapatite alone (control sites, n=15). Plaque index, gingival index, gingival bleeding index, probing pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL), bone probing depth (BPD) and hard tissue parameters such as amount of defect fill, percentage of defect fill, and changes in alveolar crest were assessed over a period of 12 months. Statistical analysis used was student's t-test and One-Way ANOVA. Results: Both test and control sites demonstrated statistically significant reduction of PD, BPD, gain in CAL and radiographic bone fill. Nevertheless the test sites showed Statistically significant improvements in all the parameters as compared to control sites at 12 months. Conclusion: Citric acid based Nano hydroxyapatite composite graft can be considered as a newer material for periodontal regeneration.},

abstract={Increment of technical knowledge has remarkably uplifted logical thinking among scientific communities to shape the theoretical concepts into near product-oriented research. The concept of nanotechnology has overwhelmed almost all forms of lives and has traded its applications in myriad fields. Despite rapid expansion of nanotechnology, sustainable competitions still do exist in the field of agriculture. In current scenario, agriculture is a manifestation demand to provide adequate nutrition for relentless growing global population. It is estimated that nearly one-third of the global crop production is destroyed annually. The loss owes to various stresses such as pest infestation, microbial pathogens, weeds, natural calamities, lack of soil fertility and much more. In order to overcome these limitations, various technological strategies are implemented but a majority of these have their own repercussions. Hence there is a scrawling progress on the evaluation of nanoparticles into agriculture sector which can reform the modern agricultural system. Applications of these nanomaterials can add tremendous value in the current scenario of a global food scarcity. Nanotechnology can address the adverse effects posed by the abundant use of chemical agrochemicals which are reported to cause biomagnification in an ecosystem. Based on these facts and consideration, present review envisages on nanoparticles as nanoherbicides, nanopesticides, onsite detection agro-pathogens and nanoparticles in post harvest management. The review also elucidates on the importance of nanoparticles in soil fertility, irrigation management and its influence on improving crop yield. With scanty reports available on nanotechnology in agriculture system, present review attributes toward developing nanoagroparticles as the future prospect which can give new facelift for existing agriculture system. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The effect of Cerium doped zirconium oxide (Ce4+ doped zirconia) nano fillers on electronic band structure and hence the optical absorption and emission properties of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) have been established. The solution casted PVA/Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 nanocomposite films were subjected to electronic (UV–Visible), fourier transform infrared (FTIR), scanning electron microscopic (SEM) and fluorescent spectral studies. The FTIR studies reveal a positive interaction between the Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 nano fillers and PVA matrix through hydroxyl groups. The electronic spectral studies reveal the changes in electronic band structure of composite with nano filler doping. The SEM images reveal homogeneous filler dispersions, while fluorescent spectral studies establish the dopant dependent photonic emission. The refractive index dispersion of developed films was established by single oscillator model developed by Wemple–Didomenico that shows a monotonic dependence on Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 loadings. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Cancer is one of the most haunted conditions in the society even though there have been treatment methods developed to cure. External Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT) is a type of radiation therapy. Radiation therapy mainly includes three phases-treatment planning, treatment plan evaluation and treatment delivery. During the treatment plan phase, the organs at risk in the respective cancer context need to be segmented from acquired medical images. In the yester years, the segmentation of target and the organs at risk was done by the doctor himself which is very tedious. But now, with the developments in the fields of technology, computerized algorithms are used for the purpose of delineating the organs at risk. The images used for treatment planning are usually CT images. This is because, the density information obtained in CT is used directly for dose calculation. In this work, rectum is segmented from CT images and segmented rectum images are useful in the treatment plan. The work deals with the segmentation of rectum during EBRT plan for treatment of prostate cancer and image processing algorithm developed based on k-means clustering. The segmentation was carried out using MATLAB. The method proves to be efficient and nearly accurate in segmenting rectum from the CT images of male pelvic region. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={To know the possibility of using Indian butter tree seed waste (mahua seed cake [MSC]) as a filler in the production of value-added product such as polyurethane (PU) green composites, a series of PU composites have been fabricated with varying amounts, namely, 0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, and 10 wt%, of MSC, and their effects on the physicomechanical properties such as density, surface hardness, tensile strength, tensile modulus, and percentage elongation at break have been studied. It was found that the tensile strength of the green composites increased from 5.61 to 9.5 MPa and tensile modulus increased from 4.75 to 6.07 MPa with an increase in filler content from 2.5 to 7.5 wt%. The fabricated PU/MSC composites were characterized for structural behavior by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and for morphological behaviors by scanning electron microscopy. The chemical resistance of the green composites in different chemical environments has been investigated. The thermal stability and thermal degradation behaviors of composites were performed using thermogravimetric analysis. The microcrystalline parameters such as crystallite size (<N>) and lattice strain (g, %) have been computed using wide-angle X-ray scattering data. Based on these parameters, the structure–property relationship of the PU/MSC green composites has been established. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Upon examination of the fruit extract of Cucumis sativus L. for its pharmacological benefits, it was previously observed that it has potential proteolytic, fibrinogenolytic and procoagulant activities. These properties can be attributed to the presence of the protease. In this regard, the present study comprised of purification and characterization of protease. Purification of the enzyme involved ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography. The purified cucumis protease (CPro) exhibits homogeneity as attested by SDS-PAGE and RP-HPLC with a retention time of 14.246 min with molecular mass ~75.3 kDa. CPro was identified as a glycoprotein and serine protease. Azocasein is the preferred substrate for CPro as it showed low Km value of 0.3809 mg/ml. Purified CPro exhibits optimum activity at 37 °C and pH 8. CPro shows its involvement in hemostasis—the very first step in wound healing. CPro degrades the subunits of human fibrinogen in the order Aα &gt; Bβ &gt; γ. It also hydrolyzes the subunits of the partially cross-linked fibrin clot in the order α-polymer &gt; γ–γ dimer &gt; β-chain. CPro reduced the clotting time of citrated plasma, prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time of plasma. CPro is neither hemorrhagic nor edema-inducing, thus considered to be a non-toxic protease. This work provides evidence for the use of cucumber extract in wound healing and authenticates its use in cosmetics. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Synthesis of gold nanobactericides (AuNBs) were achieved by treating 1 mM chloroaurate with cell free supernatant of Aneurinibacillus migulanus. Formation of AuNBs was initially was monitored with change in colour to ruby red. Further confirmation was assessed with UV–visible spectra with maximum absorption occurring at 510 nm. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis revealed the polydispersity of AuNBs with size distribution ranging from 10 to 60 nm with an average size of 30 nm. Crystalline nature was studied using X-ray diffraction which exhibited characteristic peaks indexed to Bragg's reflection at 2θ angle which confers (111), (200), (220), and (311) planes suggesting AuNBs were face-centred cubic. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis revealed absorption peaks occurring at 3341 cm−1, 1635 cm−1 and 670 cm−1 which corresponds to functional groups attributing to synthesis. The antibacterial efficacy of AuNBs was tested against selective human pathogenic bacteria and activity was measured as zone of inhibition by using disc and well diffusion. Bactericidal activity was interpreted with standard antibiotics gentamicin and kanamycin. Micro broth dilution assay expressed the minimal concentration of AuNBs to inhibit the growth of test pathogens. Highest activity was observed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MTCC 7903) with 21.00 ± 0.57 mm compared to other pathogens. The possible mode of action of AuNBs on DNA was carried out with in vitro assay as preliminary test against pathogenic DNA isolated from P. aeruginosa. Further studies will be interesting enough to reveal the exact interactive mechanism of AuNBs with DNA. Overall study contributes towards biogenic synthesis of AuNBs as one of the alternative in combating drug resistant pathogens. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The dielectric properties of lithium per chlorate (LiClO4)/polyvinylalcohol (PVA) solid polymer electrolyte dispersed with alumina (Al2O3) nanoparticles have been investigated in this work. Free standing films of Al2O3/LiClO4/PVA were prepared using solution casting method. FTIR results confirm the successful dispersion of Al2O3 in LiClO4/PVA polymer matrix. The variation in dielectric constant follows Non-Debye type behavior. The interfacial polarization phenomenon is the main reason for lower frequency regime variation in dielectric properties. The inertial properties of the dipoles play vital role in higher frequency regime. The composites with 5wt% Al2O3doped LiClO4/PVA show highest conductivity, can be used as an electrolyte with certain attainable modifications. © 2017 Author(s).},

abstract={Minimization of delay in data collection at base station is one of the major concerns in cluster based Wireless Mesh Network. There exists few other techniques for the cluster head selection in wireless mesh network such as selecting a node with maximum energy as a cluster head. In this work, We consider dynamic nodes with single hop topology with in the static cluster. To minimize the delay that occurs in transmission and reception of data, the proposed model includes four modules namely, Cluster head selection, slot allocation, slot scheduling and data collection process. In proposed model, cluster head selection is based on the maximum energy, number of links and link duration. Link duration is considered in order to avoid the link breakage that occurs before the transmission of data. Slot allocation is based on the available energy [E avail) and the required energy (E req). Slot scheduling is carried out based on the link duration. A node with minimum link duration will be given higher priority to avoid re-Transmission that indirectly results in minimization of delay. Data at the base station will be collected as they are scheduled. Mathematical model of the proposed model is presented in this work and it shows that proposed model minimizes delay compared to the existing there by improving network efficiency. © 2016 FRUCT.},

The effects of HNT content on the structural and dielectric properties were investigated. The properties of the fabricated films were probed with the intention to establish the consequence of nano-fillers on electrical characteristics/behaviours with PC. The incorporation of HNT generates notable performance enhancements through reinforcement effect. The electrical conductivity of polycarbonate got better when more than 4 wt% HNT is added. Interestingly, the integration of HNT significantly increases the dielectric permittivity of composite films with low dielectric loss which makes the nanocomposites attractive in practical applications such as electrical devices, electrical packaging and capacitors. Furthermore, the structural aspects were elucidated by X-Ray diffraction studies, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and dispersion of nanofillers in PC matrix were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy. © 2017, The Indian Institute of Metals - IIM.},

abstract={Ethnopharmacological relevance The latex of Ervatamia heyneana (Wall.) T. Cooke plant has been used for wound healing and various skin diseases by Indian tribes and folklore. Aim of the study To validate the scientific basis of heynein – a key protease of Ervatamia heyneana, in hemostasis and wound healing process. Materials and methods The latex from E. heyneana was processed and subjected to two step purification. The purified heynein was assayed for proteolytic activity using casein as substrate and also attested by zymography. The inhibition studies confirmed the nature of heynein. Pure fibrinogen was used for fibrinogenolytic activity and citrated plasma was used for coagulant and fibrinolytic activities. The edema inducing action and hemorrhagic activity of heynein were assessed on mice model. Results The purified heynein exhibited proteolytic activity, which was confirmed by caseinolytic assay and zymography. The inhibition studies confirmed heynein to be a cysteine protease. Heynein showed complete hydrolysis of all the three subunits of human fibrinogen (Aα, Bβ, γ). It exhibited strong pro-coagulant activity by reducing plasma clotting time from 248 to 39 s at 40 µg concentration. Heynein cleaved α polymer subunit in fibrin clot and did not induce edema and hemorrhage in mice models. The non-hemorrhagic nature was supported with histopathological studies of skin samples. Conclusion Heynein displays strong pro-coagulant action associated with fibrin(ogen)olytic activity. This provides basis for the observed pharmacological action of Ervatamia heyneana and thereby justifies its use in folk medicine. © 2017 Elsevier Ireland Ltd},

The basic tests such as, dry density, 28 days wet compressive strength, water absorption and rate of moisture absorption are performed on CSMB units of size 190×90×90 mm. The correction factors that are available in the literature, with respect to fired clay bricks and compressed earth blocks, so as to account for the confinement of specimens by platen restraints at the ends are used to assess the uniaxial strength of CSMB units. The corrected average values of wet compressive strength of CSMB units at 28 days are found to meet the minimum requirement of 3.5 MPa. The percentage of water absorption is found to be higher, but, still within permissible limit of 18% by weight. The average dry density is also found to meet the minimum requirement of 1750 kg/m3. The rate of moisture absorption with time is found to follow an exponential trend. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) is a key enzyme participating in the inflammatory cascade followed by the action of cyclooxygenase-2 and lipoxygenases. Therefore, inhibitors of sPLA2 could be used as potent anti-inflammatory agents to treat the early phase of inflammation. In this study, we have prepared the fenoprofen and ibuprofen analogs containing 1,3,4-oxadiazole nucleus and tested against Vipera russelli venom's basic sPLA2 (VRV-PL-VIIIa). Among the tested ligands 5(a–t),2-(2-chlorophenyl)-5-(1-(4-phenoxyphenyl) ethyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole (5m) inhibited the catalytic activity of VRV-PL-VIIIa with an IC50 value of 11.52 µM. Biophysical studies revealed that the 5m quenches the intrinsic fluorescence of VRV-PL-VIIIa, in a concentration dependent manner. Also, the compound 5m affected VRV-PL-VIIIa conformation, which was observed by circular dichroism spectra that recorded the prominent shift in the α-helix peak and the random coil formation of VRV-PL-VIIIa. Further, molecular docking analysis revealed that the compound 5m possess strong hydrophobic interactions at catalytic triad region of the VRV-PL-VIIIa. Evident to in vitro and in silico studies, 5m strongly inhibited the hemolysis of red blood cells. Our in vivo pharmacological studies revealed that the compound 5m inhibited the edematogenic activity of VRV-PL-VIIIa in mouse foot pad. Additionally, the 5m inhibited VRV-PL-VIIIa-induced myotoxicity and lung hemorrhage in mice. Overall, our ADMET results depicted that 5m possess better druggable property. Thus, this study explored the new fenoprofen and ibuprofen analog 5m as the lead-structure that serves as an anti-inflammatory agent. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Caralluma umbellata peroxidase (CUP) is an acidic heme-containing protein having a molecular weight of ~42 kDa and is specific to guaiacol. It is not a glycoprotein. It was purified to 12.5-fold purity with 6.16 % yield. Its activity is dependent on hydrogen peroxide and has an optimum pH and temperature of 6.2 and 45 °C respectively. It can decolorize dyes, viz., Aniline Blue, Reactive Black 5, and Reactive Blue 19 but not Congo Red, while HRP can decolorize Congo Red also. It has lignin-degrading potentiality as it can decompose veratryl alcohol. Detoxification of phenol was more by CUP compared to HRP while with p-nitrophenol HRP has a greater detoxification rate. Based on our results, CUP was identified to be capable of oxidizing a variety of hazardous substances and also a lignin-degrading plant biocatalyst. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common forms of liver cancer diagnosed worldwide. HCC occurs due to chronic liver disease and is often diagnosed at advanced stages. Chemotherapeutic agents such as doxorubicin are currently used as first-line agents for HCC therapy, but these are non-selective cytotoxic molecules with significant side effects. Sorafenib, a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is the only approved targeted drug for HCC patients. However, due to adverse side effects and limited efficacy, there is a need for the identification of novel pharmacological drugs beyond sorafenib. Several agents that target and inhibit various signaling pathways involved in HCC are currently being assessed for HCC treatment. In the present review article, we summarize the diverse signal transduction pathways responsible for initiation as well as progression of HCC and also the potential anticancer effects of selected targeted therapies that can be employed for HCC therapy.

abstract={Consistent search of plants for green synthesis of silver nanoparticles (SNPs) is an important arena in Nanomedicine. This study focuses on synthesis of SNPs using bioreduction of silver nitrate (AgNO3) by aqueous root extract of Decalepis hamiltonii. The biosynthesis of SNPs was monitored by UV-vis analysis at absorbance maxima 432 nm. The fluorescence emission spectra of SNPs illustrated the broad emission peak 450-483 nm at different excitation wavelengths. The surface characteristics were studied by scanning electron microscope and atomic force microscopy, showed spherical shape of SNPs and dynamic light scattering analysis confirmed the average particle size 32.5 nm and the presence of metallic silver was confirmed by energy dispersive X-ray. Face centred cubic structure with crystal size 33.3 nm was revealed by powder X-ray diffraction. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicated the biomolecules involved in the reduction mainly polyols and phenols present in root extracts were found to be responsible for the synthesis of SNPs. The stability and charge on SNPs were revealed by zeta potential analysis. In addition, on therapeutic forum, the synthesised SNPs elicit antioxidant and antimicrobial activity against Bacillus cereus, Bacillus licheniformis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. © 2016 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.},

abstract={Segmentation is a fundamental preprocessing step in medical imaging for diagnosis and surgical operations planning. The popular Fuzzy C-Means clustering algorithm perform well in the absence of noise, but it is non robust to noise as it makes use of the Euclidean distance and does not exploit the spatial information of the image. These limitations can be addressed by using the Robust Spatial Kernel FCM (RSKFCM) algorithm that takes advantage of the spatial information and uses a Gaussian kernel function to calculate the distance between the center and data points. Though RSKFCM gives a good result, the main drawback of this method is the inability of obtaining good minima for the objective function as it happens for many other clustering algorithms. To improve the efficiency of RSKFCM method, in this paper, we proposed the Ant Colony Optimization algorithm based RSKFCM (ACORSKFCM). By using the Ant Colony Optimization, RSKFCM initializes the cluster centers and reaches good minima of the objective function. Experimental results carried out on the standard medical datasets like Brain, Lungs, Liver and Breast images. The results show that the proposed approach outperforms many other FCM variants.

abstract={Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs) are characterized by bandwidth constrained links, multiple hops and dynamic topologies. Routing should provide quality of service in the mobile adhoc networks is a highly challenging task. In this study, we discussed the unicast routing in MANETs with enhancements to the Temporally Ordered Routing Algorithm (TORA). Temporally Ordered Routing Algorithm (TORA) is a highly scalable routing protocol for MANETs. TORA is dependent on the services provided by the internet encapsulation protocol to effectively carry out with its three main functions; route creation, route maintenance and route erasing. Route discovery in TORA is done in a cooperative manner with intermediate nodes contributing to the route generation from one node to another. Precision in route build-up demands that all network nodes portray persistent benevolent behaviour. This is however, not always possible to achieve and so a number of malicious nodes participate in the route discovery process only to sabotage the network by violating the protocol. This study will give the novel mechanism for establishing trust in ad-hoc networks that execute the Temporally Ordered Routing Algorithm (TORA) protocol. The main objective is to limit control message propagation in the highly dynamic mobile computing environment. Each node has to explicitly initiate a query when it needs to send data to a particular destination. © Medwell Journals, 2017.},

abstract={Hybrid nanocomposites are different from normal polymer nanocomposites, as they contain different types of nanomaterials together in a polymer matrix. These hybrids are not simply physical mixtures of different nanomaterials, but they are more homogenous and exhibit synergistic properties. Hybrid nanocomposites based on water soluble polymers can overcome several limitations of conventional water soluble polymers. Gelatin is one such water soluble protein based polymer having different applications in areas such as biomedical, food, drugs, and paper industries. Hybrid nanocomposites of gelatin nanocomposites were fabricated by incorporating three different types of nanomaterials such as cellulose nanocrystals, amine functionalized nanoclay, and silver nanoparticles in different combinations after which their properties were then evaluated. These materials were found to have good mechanical, barrier, and thermal properties. This chapter is intended to give an insight about the synthesis, characterization, and applications of gelatin-based hybrid nanocomposites. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

abstract={In organic field effect transistors (OFETs), charge transport in the conducting channel and charge injection from metal electrodes into the conducting channel is highly dependent on the quality and reliability of the insulator-organic semiconductor (OSC) and electrodes-OSC interfaces respectively. In this regard, the choice of the dielectric and the metal is as important as that of OSC. In this paper, simulation is performed using organic transistor modelling software for Rubrene based OFETs with different dielectric materials and metal contacts. Further, influence of interface traps at the insulator-OSC interface and impact of charge injection barrier and density of states (DOS) at the source electrode-OSC interface on OFETs electrical characteristics is studied. In addition, surface Fermi level pinning effect and influence of the semiconductor layer thickness is also discussed. The obtained simulation data shows that the results can be further improved by introducing high dielectric material and high work function hole injecting source/drain contacts. It is found that there is a reduction in the charge carrier mobility in disordered OSC with interface traps as compared to crystalline OSC without interface traps. Variation of both threshold voltage and practical onset voltage is observed due to the Fermi level pinning. Also, increase of threshold voltage is observed when non-linear injection occurs due to injection barrier. It is observed that the reduction of OSC layer thickness results in an increase in the drain current and variation of sub threshold slope. Steeper sub-threshold slope correlates to the lower trap density that results in better switching behaviour of OFETs. This simulation clarifies a number of issues that can help in design, fabrication and characterisation of organic electronic devices. © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={Banyan tree saw dust (BSD) powder filled polypropylene (PP) green composites have been fabricated with varying amounts viz., 0, 20 and 40 wt% of BSD particulate filler by using a co-rotating twin screw extruder. The effect of BSD content on the mechanical properties has been studied. While drilling studies on glass fibre reinforced composites have been reported, not many studies have been reported on machining of natural fibre reinforced polymer composites. Hence, in the present study CNC milling and drilling behaviour of the PP/BSD green composites has been investigated. The surface roughness of the CNC milled and drilled composite specimens was measured to assess the effect of BSD content, cutting speed and feed rate on the machining behaviour of the green composites since machining often causes dimensional variations, burr formation, etc. Optical micrographs of the chips obtained during machining operations were examined and the milled surfaces studied under scanning electron microscope (SEM). Furthermore, the effects of addition of 4 wt% PP-g-MA (coupling agent) and 4% talc (mineral filler) on PP/BSD have also been evaluated. It was observed that unlike in metals, the surface roughness increases with increasing cutting speed in the PP-BSD composites. ©2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={In this paper, a thorough study and quantitative analysis of different brain tumor segmentation techniques will be addressed. Several significant algorithms are proposed in literature for partitioning MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) brain image into considerable multiple disjoint regions indicating tumor tissues and normal brain tissues. But, benchmarking brain tumor segmentation (BTS) techniques is found very less. In this regard, we study, explore and create benchmark for most popular and widely accepted segmentation techniques such as histogram thresholding, adaptive k-means clustering, region based active contour SVM and PCA based K-NN classifier. A detailed quantitative evaluation of aforesaid techniques on the MRI images from the standard datasets as well as collection of our own datasets is presented. An analysis of results reported will have an excellent impact on current and future research efforts in brain tumor segmentation. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.},

abstract={This experimental study deals with utilization of Coarse Recycled Concrete Aggregate (CRCA) and Fine Recycled Concrete Aggregates (FRCA) in Self compacting concrete (SCC) mixes. The concrete mix is designed for target strength of 40 MPa as per “Modified Nan-su Method”, with Fly Ash as mineral admixture. Four mixes are considered in the study viz., Control Mix (CM) with natural aggregates, 20% CRCA, 20% FRCA and both at 20% replacement levels. The slump flow and T500 time, V-funnel time, L-box height ratio, GTM stability test are conducted to evaluate the fresh properties of SCC mixes. The slump flow test result of the SCC mix containing 20% CRCA and FRCA, fails to satisfy the EFNARC (European Federation of National Associations Representing for Concrete) acceptance criteria marginally. However, results of T500 time, V-Funnel time, L-box height ratio, GTM screen stability test of all the four mixes are found to be within the specified limits. The tests on hardened properties are conducted to assess the cube compressive strength at 3, 7 and 28 days and split tensile strength of cylinders at 28 days. The hardened properties of SCC mixes containing recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) are found to be slightly higher than CM. Based on test results with respect to fresh and hardened properties and with focus on concrete waste utilization, SCC with 20% (CRCA+FRCA) is considered as the preferred mix combination. The durability tests such as sulphate and acid attack are conducted for this mix. The compressive strength is found to reduce by about 11% and 40%, after thirty days of immersion in Na2SO4and H2SO4 solutions respectively. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

The electronic spectral studies reflects the filler induced changes in the electronic band structure of PVA leading to decreased optical energy gaps from 4.25 eV to 3.55 eV, in addition to a systematic Refractive Index (RI) boost in line with Lorentz-Lorenz effective medium theory.

abstract={This paper presents a new approach for detecting major differences in brain activities between Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) patients and neurotypical subjects using the resting state fMRI. Further the method also extracts discriminative features for an accurate diagnosis of ASD. The proposed approach determines a spatial filter that projects the covariance matrices of the Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) time-series signals from both the ASD patients and neurotypical subjects in orthogonal directions such that they are highly separable. The inverse of this filter also provides a spatial pattern map within the brain that highlights those regions responsible for the distinguishable activities between the ASD patients and neurotypical subjects. For a better classification, highly discriminative log-variance features providing the maximum separation between the two classes are extracted from the projected BOLD time-series data. A detailed study has been carried out using the publicly available data from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) consortium for the different gender and age-groups. The study results indicate that for all the above categories, the regional differences in resting state activities are more commonly found in the right hemisphere compared to the left hemisphere of the brain. Among males, a clear shift in activities to the prefrontal cortex is observed for ASD patients while other parts of the brain show diminished activities compared to neurotypical subjects. Among females, such a clear shift is not evident; however, several regions, especially in the posterior and medial portions of the brain show diminished activities due to ASD. Finally, the classification performance obtained using the log-variance features is found to be better when compared to earlier studies in the literature. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The concept and design of a novel drag enhancement system called the Ultra-thin Wires Drag Enhancement System (UWDES), is presented. The UWDES uses numerous ultra-thin wires to form a three dimensional (3D) web through electrostatic charging. UWDES is designed with the objective of mitigating space debris, particularly in low altitude Earth orbits (LEOs) for pico/nano/micro-satellites by causing their rapid orbital decay. The ultra-thin drag-wires are stowed inside the container module of UWDES and at the end of spacecraft's mission life, deployed by releasing the container lid, followed by electrostatic charging. In comparison to drag sails, the UWDES drag-wires provide more effective area experiencing drag (EAED) for a given mass and size of the material used to fabricate the drag enhancing structure. For a unit cube of side 1 cm, (i) beaten into a square sheet of 1 micron thickness and (ii) drawn into a round wire of same thickness, the EAED for (i) is 1 m2 and (ii) is 1.2732 m2. The ultra-thin drag-wires of the UWDES are held straight in a tuft with all strands fused together at both ends. When they are electrostatically charged, due to mutual repulsion on acquiring like charges, they unwind from spool and deploy out of container module to gradually arrange into a 3D web structure. With this, all the individual ultra-thin drag-wire strands are exposed to incoming atoms and ions of space atmosphere and thus augment the effective area experiencing drag (EAED) of the host spacecraft and the resultant aero drag. As the drag wires are electrostatically charged, they mutually repel with like-charged particles of space atmosphere that collide with them resulting in Coulomb drag. Hybrid-drag effect of both Aero drag and Coulomb drag are responsible for stretching the ceiling altitude for UWDES application up to 6000 km. Based on the amount of charges supplied to the wires, the UWDES is designed to arrange itself into various 3D configurations (boat-shape, spindle/pear, globe and flower), resulting in varying EAED. It may be argued that the deployment mechanism of UWDES, which involves a lid release relay followed by electrostatic charging, is simpler in operation and has a lesser chance of deployment failure compared to drag-sails that employ moving parts like motors. Varying in the way ultra-thin wires deploy from container, UWDES has two variants namely fixed-spool and deployable-spool. Also, based on charging, UWDES is categorised into passive- and active-charging variants. Copyright © 2017 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF). All rights reserved.},

Nitrile imines generated by the catalytic dehydrogenation of hydrazones by chloramine-T, were trapped in situ by 4-(furan-2-yl)but-3-en-2-one to obtain an isomeric mixture of furan tethered 2-pyrazolines. The new compounds were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, MS studies and elemental analyses. The synthesized new 2-pyrazolines have been screened in vitro for their antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. Molecular docking and ADMET studies was done to understand the mode of action of synthesized compounds.

The preliminary structure-activity relationship revealed that tryptophan, tyrosine, phenylalanine, proline and cysteine conjugated compounds showed excellent antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities. This may be explained by the contribution of aromaticity and hydrophobicity of amino acids.

abstract={Background: The vital enzymes of starch digestion and absorption are intestinal α-glucosidases and their inhibition improves postprandial hyperglycaemia, constituting an effective mode of therapy in diabetes. Objectives: The present study was designed to assess the inhibitory potential of ethanol extract of banana flower (EF) on mammalian α-glucosidases and its pharmacological effects on postprandial hyperglycaemia in normal and alloxan-induced diabetic rats. Materials and Methods: EF was evaluated for its inhibitory potential and mode of inhibition on mammalian α-glucosidases. Further, the role of EF and its constituents Umbelliferone (C1) and Lupeol (C2) on glucose uptake using isolated rat hemi-diaphragm and insulinotropic activity using RINm5F (rat insulinoma) cell lines were determined. The phytocomponents in EF were also evaluated using GC-MS. Results: EF illustrated a dose-dependent inhibition for rat intestinal sucrase, maltase and p-nitrophenyl-α-D-glucopyranoside (pNPG) hydrolysis (IC50 values: 18.76±0.22, 25.54±0.10 and 76.42±1.12 μg/ml, respectively) and the mode of inhibition was non-competitive with low Ki values. Oral administration (100-200 mg/kg b.wt.) of EF significantly improved the maltose/glucose-induced postprandial hyperglycaemia in normal and alloxan-induced diabetic rats. EF, C1 and C2 exhibited stimulation of glucose uptake and a dose-dependent glucose-induced insulin secretion at both 4.5 and 16.7 mM glucose concentrations. Further, GC-MS analysis revealed significant levels of steroids (25.61%), diazoprogesterone (21.31%), sesquiterpene (11.78%) and other phytocomponents. Conclusion: EF inhibited α-glucosidases besides promoting glucose uptake and insulin secretion, resulting in antihyperglycaemic effect determining EF as a potent anti-diabetic agent. © 2017 Pharmacognosy Magazine | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.},

abstract={Bi2O3 filled Isophthalic resin based polymer composites of different weight % (0, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 &amp; 60) were fabricated by open mould cast technique. Gamma attenuation study was carried out using NaI (Tl) gamma ray spectrometer for Cs-137. The shielding parameters such as attenuation coefficient, HVL &amp; λ were investigated. The distribution of the filler within the matrix was studied using Scanning Electron Microscopy. X ray diffractometer and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy were employed to study the structural changes if any. The thermal stability and mechanical strength of the composites were investigated using TGA &amp; UTM respectively. Dielectric properties and AC conductivity were also studied using LCR meter. The composites are found to be thermally stable upto 200 °C. There were no such structural changes observed and all the composites show very low conductivity. The mechanical strength of the composites was found to increase upon adding the bismuth oxide with a slight decrease when the concentration of the filler exceeds 40 wt%. Attenuation results reveal that, the shielding efficiency increases with the increase of the filler wt% and are comparable to those of the conventional shielding materials. Hence, Bi2O3 filled composites can be used for gamma shielding applications. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Condensed-bicyclic 4,6-substituted1,2,4-triazolo-1,3,4-thiadiazole derivatives (CBTT) have been shown to possess a wide spectrum of pharmacological activities. In this study, several novel CBTT derivatives were synthesized and investigated for their possible role as anti-neoplastic agents. The anti-proliferative effect of various CBTT derivatives was analyzed against tumor cell lines by (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) MTT assay. One of the potential CBTT derivative, 5-(3-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[3,4-b][1,3,4]thiadiazol-6-yl)flurobenzonitrile (DTTF) was found to be the most potent against cervical cancer SiHa cells and exhibited minimal effect against normal cells. Molecular docking analysis indicated that transcription factor NF-κB was one of the potential molecular targets modulated by DTTF. Specifically, the drug blocked the TNFα-induced phosphorylation of upstream IκBα kinase in a time-dependent manner leading to the suppression of NF-κB activation and nuclear translocation. DTTF also potentiated the apoptotic effect of TNFα, as well as significantly inhibited migration and invasion of tumor cells. Overall, these findings indicate a potential novel role and mechanism(s) of action of DTTF as an anticancer agent against diverse malignancies. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a novel text categorization method based on modified Support Vector Clustering (SVC). SVC is a density based clustering approach, which handles the arbitrary shape clusters effectively. The main drawback of traditional SVC is that it treats unclassified documents as outliers. To overcome this problem, we employed Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) to cluster unclassified documents. The modified SVC (SVC-FCM) is applied to categorize text documents. The proposed method consists of three steps: In the first step, Regularized Locality Preserving Indexing (RLPI) is applied on Term Document Matrix (TDM) to reduce dimensionality of features. In second step, we use SVC to find base-cluster centers of documents. Finally, we use FCM to cluster unclassified documents. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we conducted experiments on standard 20-NewsGroup dataset. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={The LBP is a technique used to extract textures of an image, especially in facial image analysis. As we are intended to extract more fine texture details of an image to increase the rate of facial similarity, we combined the techniques of LBP with Gabor filters to obtain a fine texture details. The Gabor filters are designed to multiply the filter coefficients with an LBP pattern to get more finely textured images. The gabor filter used in this proposed method helped to filter the coefficients of LBP pattern with gabor filters. The gabor filter is a technique used to generate a real and imaginary parts of a trignometric function with respect to θ. Similarly, LBP pattern is an individual technique used to extract a texture of an image in terms of local binary patterns. By combining the two individual techniques into a single technique and by employing a non-uniform LBP Pattern, we will be able to extract more finely textured images of a dataset. The result of combining LBP with Gabor filter produces a result of 93.4%, which is better than individual approaches. © 2016 IEEE.},

A standard syllable level speech database consisting of 525 syllables is built for synthesizing naturally sounding speech. The main advantage of this system is the real time approach for conversion of entered text to corresponding speech. The initial and the final points of a speech waveform are determined using Maximum energy and zero crossing rate.

abstract={The 'king of fruits' Mango (Mangifera indica L.) is the most sought after fruit for both direct and indirect consumption across the globe. Since it has very high export value, there is a need to develop a technique that is capable of classifying the defects of mangoes objectively. Any classifier performance is dependent on the features extracted from the region of interest of the sample. In this paper, a comparative study of feature extraction methods is made to classify the visible defects of Mangoes. 'Alphonso' mango cultivar was chosen for the experimentation. 1766 color images with different quality classes were acquired, pre-processed and textural features were extracted considering one feature at a time and also in combination for each color image. Hence, we obtained 9 different cases of different textural features combination. Furthermore, most relevant features were selected from each case using sequential forward selection algorithm. The textural features like statistical, LBP and filter banks were found to be effective in designing neural network (NN) using generalized linear model classifier with cross validated performance accuracy of 90.09%, 90.26% and 90.26% for linear, logistic and softmax activation functions respectively. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents a Picture Fuzzy Clustering (PFC) method for MRI brain image segmentation. The PFC is based on the Picture fuzzy set, which is the generalization of the traditional fuzzy set and intuitionistic fuzzy set. In traditional fuzzy set, the problem of uncertainty arises in defining the membership function. Intuitionistic fuzzy set handles this uncertainty by considering hesitation degree. However, intuitionistic fuzzy set fails to solve real time problems which require answers like yes, abstain, no and refusal. The picture fuzzy set solves these problems by considering refusal degree along with membership, neutral and nonmembership degree. Thus, the cluster centers in the PFC may converge to a desirable location than the cluster centers obtained using traditional Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) and Intuitionistic Fuzzy Clustering (IFC). Experimentation is carried out on the standard MRI brain image dataset. To assess the performance, the proposed method is compared with the existing FCM and IFC methods. Results show that the proposed method gives the better result. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={In today's world, to make man-machine interaction more effective speech recognition plays an important role in speech processing. This paper presents the application of Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT), a mathematical tool applied for feature extraction phase of the speech signal processing. These features are modeled and evaluated using Vector Quantization(VQ) and Fuzzy C Means(FCM) techniques. The proposed system highlights the importance of Discrete Cosine Transformation(DCT) applied for Hilbert Huang Transform to extract the better speech signal parameters. The features obtained from this process has better recognition accuracies. It also demonstrates the efficiency of DCT with HHT for FCM clustering technique over the VQ technique.

abstract={Fundus Image analysis is a major concern with respect to various disease detection. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is seen in patients suffering from diabetes mellitus type 2 which leads to blindness. Fundus images are used to identify abnormalities like microaneurysms, haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, exudates, venous beading, and optic disc oedema that cause DR. Automated diagnosis of DR gives first-hand information about the disease presence, and save diabetic patients from vision loss. This paper presents a novel ensemble approach to automatically detect exudates in the fundus images. Normal background features are removed initially. Morphological operations combined with logical operations is the ensemble approach that has enhanced the detection and marking of exudates. Publicly available standard database DIARETDB1 and images of Forus Health is used to experiment the algorithm. 89.6% of specificity, 100% of sensitivity is obtained and evaluated with logistic regression classifier. Also, 89.13% of positive predictive value and 100% negative predictive value is obtained with this approach. The AUC of ROC plot obtained is 0.969. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Owing to the self organizing, self configuring and self healing capabilities, Wireless Mesh Networks (WMN) have emerged as most powerful architectures in recent times. WMN operate with limited battery resources. To save energy, ieee 802.11s has introduced a mechanism called power save mode(PSM) which switches STA mode from active to light sleep or deep sleep mode when STA is not involved in transmission. Several models have been proposed by researchers to improve the energy saving mechanisms in 802.11s. Most of the researchers have considered node position as static while proposing their model. In WMN nodes are subjected to change their position over a period of time depending on the mobility mode and pattern. Under mobility conditions there could be higher energy consumption at STA compared to static cases. Hence in this work, we propose an energy saving model that involves STA mobility and trigger power save modes based on the remaining energy at each STA. The experiments have been conducted using RandomWayPoint mobility model in Network Simulator3. The behaviour of the model is observed by keeping STA position dynamic. The results show that energy consumption rate of STA is high under mobility conditions compared to static. By Implementing PSM under mobility situations, we are able save substantial energy thus increasing the life of the batteries associated with each STA in a WMN. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) represent a cluster of relatively common developmental conditions which require an early and accurate diagnosis for an effective remedial therapy. Resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) is considered an important tool to investigate the differences in functional connectivity due to ASD. In this paper, an Enhanced Effect-Size Thresholding (EEST) method is developed for extracting connectivity based features to diagnose ASD automatically from rs-fMRI. In this method, a whitening step is first used to decorrelate the Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) signals (time-series) from the 90 representative regions of the brain based on the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) template. Using these whitened time-series signals, the group-wise (ASD versus Neurotypical) differences in pairwise-connectivity are compared based on their effect-size. The connections corresponding to larger values of effect-size are alone considered for feature extraction. The z-transformed correlation co-efficients are used as features and the classification is performed using a support vector machine. The publicly available Autism Brain Imaging data Exchange (ABIDE) dataset is used to evaluate the performance of EEST and it is found that EEST can achieve better classification performance when compared to the earlier method. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={An eye disease which is assorted in person with diabetes that is occurred by change in blood vessels of the retina is called Diabetic Retinopathy. Retinopathy can occur with all types of diabetes and can cause vision loss if it's not treated on time. Detection of exudate by ophthalmologist normally takes time and energy. In this paper, classification and detection of exudate in color retinal image using automated technique have been proposed. This method reduces work of ophthalmologist. A series of steps or actions need to be taken for exudate detection. Firstly in pre-processing step, green channel extraction is used and optic disk is eliminated to prevent optic disk from interfacing with exudates detection. Robust Spatial Kernel FCM (RSKFCM) segmentation method is used for optic disk elimination which gives good result compared to other FCM based method. The significant features are extracted from the segmented images and are used for classification purpose. Meta-cognitive neural network method is used as classifier. The experiments were conducted on standard diabetic retinal image dataset. Experimental results shows that the proposed method gives promising results. © 2016 IEEE.},

Active contours are considered to be the promising solutions to such a challenging task. The major issues with Active contours are computation of gradient information, initialization and occlusion detection. To address these issues effectively, an edge gradient driven Geodesic active contour(GAC) with a novel approach of detecting seed points based on foreground markers is proposed in this paper.

abstract={Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)/sodium alginate (NaAlg) polymer composites were prepared by doping with lithium perchlorate salt (LiClO4) using solution casting method. The miscibility, crystallinity, conductivity, thermal behavior, mechanical strength and free volume properties have been examined. The FTIR results reveal that the dopant (Li+) ions interact strongly with polymer chains through hydrogen bonding. X-ray diffraction patterns show a variation in the degree of crystallinity with increase in LiClO4 concentration. The dc conductivity increases with addition of LiClO4 salt concentration at room temperature and is attributed to increase in the number of mobile charge carriers (Li+ and ClO4 −) and degree of dissociation of salt in the composites. The variations in the mechanical properties are observed upon doping. The differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) study shows a single glass transition temperature (Tg) and reveals the compatibility and variation in the decomposition temperature (Td). Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) shows a decrease in the decomposition temperature with addition of lithium salt concentration. The positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) and Doppler broadening measurements were carried out for all the samples in terms of positron annihilation and positronium formation. The S-parameter shows a similar behavior as that of the o-Ps lifetime and o-Ps intensity. The correlation between carrier concentration and ionic conductivity with Ps formation was observed in this particular system. The conductivity versus temperature plot was found to follow an Arrhenius nature. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Epoxy-based shape memory polymers (SMEPs) are gaining importance in the area of aerospace structures due to their high strength and stiffness which is a primary requirement for an SMEP in structural applications. The understanding of viscoelastic behavior of SMEPs is very essential to assess their shape memory effect. In the present work, three types of SMEPs with varying cross-linking densities were developed by curing an aromatic epoxy resin with aliphatic amines. Glass transition temperature (Tg) was measured for these SMEPs using advanced rheometric expansion system, and from the Tg measurements, a range of temperatures from glassy to rubbery regimes were chosen. At selected temperatures, creep-recovery tests were performed in order to evaluate the viscoelastic behavior of SMEPs and also to investigate the effect of temperature on creep-recovery. Further, a three-parameter viscoelastic model (Zener) was used to fit the data obtained from experiments. Model parameters like moduli of the springs and viscosity of the dashpot were evaluated by curve fitting. Results revealed that Zener model was well suited to describe the viscoelastic behavior of SMEPs as a function of test temperatures. © 2016, ASM International.},

abstract={The paper reports the results of moisture and filler induced effects on the dynamic mechanical properties of glass fiber reinforced epoxy hybrid composites. The rate of water diffusion into the composites has been determined to understand the effect of moisture on the dynamic mechanical properties. Significant differences in the moisture uptake properties of the composites are observed which induce changes in storage modulus (E′), loss modulus (E″), and damping factor (tan δ). It is also observed that water diffusion depends on the free volume content of the hybrid composites. Results of this study indicate that hybrid composites with combination of micro and nanofillers possess good dynamic mechanical properties in presence of moisture at higher temperatures. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Permeability behaviour of compacted fine-grained soils has immense practical importance in view of the performance of various geotechnical engineering structures such as embankments, earth dams, sub-grades of pavements, compacted clay liners at land fills and the like. Many factors appear to control the permeability behaviour of compacted fine-grained soils. The present paper discusses these factors critically with illustrations. Soils of same liquid limit level having almost same void ratio exhibit significantly higher values of coefficient of permeability on the dry side of optimum when compared with those on wet side of optimum. It has been brought out that void ratio is not the only factor controlling the coefficient of permeability. But it is the soil fabric/effective pore size which controls significantly the coefficient of permeability at the same void ratio level. It has been further brought out that placement condition, soil fabric, effective pore size, clay mineralogical composition and void ratio appear to control the coefficient of permeability in the order of their importance. © 2016, Indian Geotechnical Society.},

abstract={Background The proteases from turmeric species have procoagulant and fibrinogenolytic activity. This provides a scientific basis for traditional use of turmeric to stop bleeding and promote wound healing processes. Purpose Our previous studies revealed that fibrinogenolytic action of crude enzyme fraction of Curcuma aromatica Salisb., was found to be more influential than those of Curcuma longa L., Curcuma caesia Roxb., Curcuma amada Roxb. and Curcuma zedoria (Christm.) Roscoe. Hence, the purpose of this study is to purify and characterize protease from C. aromatica and to explore its role in wound healing process. Methods The protease was purified by Sephadex G-50 gel permeation chromatography. Peak with potent proteolytic activity was subjected to rechromatography and then checked for homogeneity by SDS-PAGE and native PAGE. Furthermore purity of the peak was assessed by RP-HPLC and MALDI-TOF. The biochemical properties, type of protease, kinetic studies, fibrinogenolytic, coagulant and fibrinolytic activities were carried out. Results The two proteolytic peaks were fractionated in gel permeation chromatography. Among these, the peak-II showed potent proteolytic activity with specific activity of 10 units/mg/min and named as C. aromatica protease-II (CAP-II). This protein resolved into a single sharp band both in SDS-PAGE (reducing and non-reducing) as well as in native (acidic) PAGE. It is a monomeric protein, showing sharp peak in RP-HPLC and its relative molecular mass was found to be 12.378 kDa. The caseinolytic and fibrinolytic activity of CAP-II was completely inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (PMSF). The CAP-II exhibited optimum temperature of 45 °C and optimum pH of 7.5. The Km and Vmax of CAP-II was found to be 1.616 µg and 1.62 units/mg/min respectively. The CAP-II showed hydrolysis of all three subunits of fibrinogen in the order Aα > Bß > γ. The CAP-II exhibited strong procoagulant activity by reducing the human plasma clotting time. It also showed fibrinolytic activity by complete hydrolysis of α-polymer and γ-γ dimer present in fibrin. Conclusion The CAP-II is a novel serine protease from C. aromatica, which has been demonstrated to stop bleeding and initiate wound healing through its procoagulant and fibrin(ogen)olytic activities. Our study demonstrates the possible role of CAP-II, as therapeutic enzyme to stop bleeding at the time of wounding. © 2016 Elsevier GmbH},

abstract={The present study emphasizes on biogenic synthesis of silver nanoparticles and their bactericidal activity against human and phytopathogens. Nanoparticle synthesis was performed using endosymbiont Pseudomonas fluorescens CA 417 inhabiting Coffea arabica L. Synthesized nanoparticles were characterized using hyphenated spectroscopic techniques such as UV–vis spectroscopy which revealed maximum absorption 425 nm. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis revealed the possible functional groups mediating and stabilizing silver nanoparticles with predominant peaks occurring at 3346 corresponding to hydroxyl group, 1635 corresponding carbonyl group and 680 to aromatic group. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis revealed the Bragg's diffraction pattern with distinct peaks at 38° 44°, 64° and 78° revealing the face-centered cubic (fcc) metallic crystal corresponding to the (111), (200), (220) and (311) facets of the crystal planes at 2θ angle. The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis revealed presence of high intense absorption peak at 3 keV is a typical characteristic of nano-crystalline silver which confirmed the presence of elemental silver. TEM analysis revealed the size of the nanoparticles to be in the range 5–50 nm with polydisperse nature of synthesized nanoparticles bearing myriad shapes. The particle size determined by Dynamic light scattering (DLS) method revealed average size to be 20.66 nm. The synthesized silver nanoparticles exhibited significant antibacterial activity against panel of test pathogens. The results showed Klebsiella pneumoniae (MTCC 7407) and Xanthomonas campestris to be more sensitive among the test human pathogen and phyto-pathogen respectively. The study also reports synergistic effect of silver nanoparticles in combination with kanamycin which displayed increased fold activity up to 58.3% against Klebsiella pneumoniae (MTCC 7407). The results of the present investigation are promising enough and attribute towards growing scientific knowledge on development of new antimicrobial agents to combat drug resistant microorganisms. The study provides insight on emerging role of endophytes towards reduction of metal salts to synthesize nanoparticles. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={ContextWithania somnifera (L.) Dunal is traditionally used for treating various ailments, but lacks scientific evaluation. Objective This study evaluates Withania somnifera (WS) for its effect on platelet activity and inflammatory enzymes. Materials and methods Aqueous and ethanolic (1:1) leaf extracts were subjected to in vitro indirect haemolytic activity using Naja naja venom, human platelet aggregation was quantified for lipid peroxidation using arachidonic acid (AA) as agonist and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) levels were determined using standard spectrometric assays. Further, molecular docking was performed by the ligand fit method using molegro software package (Molegro ApS, Aarhus, Denmark). Results The study found that aqueous and ethanol extracts have very negligible effect (15%) with an IC50 value of 13.8 mg/mL on PLA2 from Naja naja venom. Further, extracts of WS also had very little effect (18%) with an IC50 value of 16.6 mg/mL on malondialdehyde (MDA) formation. However, a 65% inhibition of 5-LOX with an IC50 value of 0.92 mg/mL was observed in 1:1 ethanol extracts. The same was evident from SAR model with the active ingredient withaferin A binding predominantly on Phe 77, Tyr 98, Arg 99, Asp 164, Leu 168, Ser 382, Arg 395, Tyr 396 and Tyr 614 with an atomic contact energy value of −128.96 compared to standard phenidone (−103.61). Thus, the current study validates the application of WS for inflammatory diseases. Conclusion This study reveals the inhibitory potential of W. somnifera on inflammatory enzymes and platelet aggregation. Thus, WS can serve as a newer, safer and affordable medicine for inflammatory diseases. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Banana is an extensively cultivated plant worldwide, mainly for its fruit, while its ancillary product, the banana pseudostem, is consumed as a vegetable and is highly recommended for diabetics in the traditional Indian medicine system. The present study was aimed at elucidating the mechanism of antihyperglycaemia exerted by the ethanol extract of banana pseudostem (EE) and its isolated compounds viz., stigmasterol (C1) and β-sitosterol (C2), in an alloxan-induced diabetic rat model. Diabetic rats which were administered with C1, C2 and EE (100 and 200 mg per kg b. wt.) for 4 weeks showed reduced levels of fasting blood glucose and reversal of abnormalities in serum/urine protein, urea and creatinine in diabetic rats compared to the diabetic control group of rats. Diabetic symptoms such as polyphagia, polydipsia, polyuria, urine glucose and reduced body weight were ameliorated in the diabetic group of rats fed with EE, C1 and C2 (100 mg per kg b. wt., once daily) for 28 days. The levels of insulin and Hb were also increased, while the HbA1c level was reduced. The altered activities of hepatic marker enzymes viz., aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP); glycolytic enzyme (hexokinase); shunt enzyme (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase); gluconeogenic enzymes (glucose-6-phosphatase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase) and pyruvate kinase were significantly reverted to normal levels by the administration of EE, C1 and C2. In addition, increased levels of hepatic glycogen and glycogen synthase and the corresponding decrease of glycogen phosphorylase activity in diabetic rats illustrated the antihyperglycaemic potential of EE and its components. The histological observations revealed a marked regeneration of the β-cells in the drug treated diabetic rats. These findings suggest that EE might exert its antidiabetic potential in the presence of C1 and C2, attributable to the enhanced glycolytic activity, besides increasing the hepatic glucose utilization in diabetic rats by stimulating insulin secretion from the remnant β-cells. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={Diabetes is a major chronic metabolic disorder globally and around of 285 million people are affected by the disease and the number is expected to double in the next two decades. The major focus of anti-diabetic therapies is to enhance insulin production, sensitivity and/or reduce the blood glucose level. Although several synthetic drugs have been developed as antidiabetic agents but their utility has been hampered due to their side effects and poor efficacy. In this scenario, research on natural products has been gained importance due their safety profile in toxicity studies. Terpenoids belong to an important class of natural products and several terpenoids have been reported as antidiabetic agents. Some of them are under various stages of pre-clinical and clinical evaluation to develop them as antidiabetic agents. These agents can inhibit enzymes responsible for the development of insulin resistance, normalization of plasma glucose and insulin levels and glucose metabolism. Triterpenes can act as promising agents in the treatment of diabetic retinopathy, neuropathy and nephropathy or in impaired wound healing by inhibiting several pathways involved in the diabetes and associated complications. However, efforts in understanding the biological actions and clinical studies involving the applications of triterpenes in treating diabetes are very limited. Hence, special attention is imperative to explore the therapeutic potential of these compounds and provide new information to the scientific community. This review aims to provide the recent advances in triterpenes chemistry, its derivatives, biological interventions and its therapeutic applications with special emphasis on diabetes and its associated disorders. © 2016 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={Arsenic is present in earth's crust and occurs in more than 200 natural minerals. Under favourable environmental conditions, arsenic enters into the groundwater. Groundwater has been the major source of arsenic exposure to human population around the world. The incidence of arsenic in drinking water, above the standard limit (0.05mg/L as per IS: 10500) has emerged as a major public health problem. Water constituting arsenic above 10μg/L is a major concern. Arsenic has reference dose or reference value of 3E-4 mg.kg-1.d-1 as an estimate of a daily exposure to the human population that is likely to be without an appreciable risk of deleterious effects during a lifetime. Lesions manifest at exposure levels of about 0.002-0.02 mg As kg-1.d-1. The trivalent form of arsenic is considered to be 60 times more toxic than pentavalent form. This communication contemplates on presenting the sources of arsenic, and the influencing factors that facilitate arsenic to groundwater, health implications and present regulation on drinking water standards. From the review, it is clear that the consumption of arsenic contaminated water can cause a wide range of acute and chronic diseases in humans. The source of arsenic for groundwater is mainly geogenic in nature. Therefore, if the groundwater is selected as the source of water, routine monitoring for arsenic becomes a vital step before it is conveyed to the end users for drinking or irrigation or industrial purposes.},

abstract={The classification of dysfluencies is one of the important steps in objective measurement of stuttering disorder. In this work, the focus is on investigating the applicability of automatic speaker recognition (ASR) method for stuttering dysfluency recognition. The system designed for this particular task relies on the Gaussian mixture model (GMM), which is the most widely used probabilistic modeling technique in ASR. The GMM parameters are estimated from Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs). This statistical speaker-modeling technique represents the fundamental characteristic sounds of speech signal. Using this model, we build a dysfluency recognizer that is capable of recognizing dysfluencies irrespective of a person as well as what is being said. The performance of the system is evaluated for different types of dysfluencies such as syllable repetition, word repetition, prolongation, and interjection using speech samples from the University College London Archive of Stuttered Speech (UCLASS). © 2016 by De Gruyter.},

abstract={The present paper presents one of the efficient approaches toward multilingual text detection for video indexing. In this paper, we propose a method for detecting textlocated in varying and complex background in images/video. The present approach comprises four stages: In the first stage, combination of wavelet transform and Gabor filter is applied. By applying single level 2D wavelet decomposition with Gabor Filter, the intrinsic features comprising sharpen edges and texture features of an input image are obtained. In the second stage, the resultant Gabor image is classified using k-means clustering algorithm. In the third stage, morphological operations are performed on clustered pixels. Then a concept of linked list approach is used to build a true textline sequence of connected components. In the final stage, wavelet entropy of an input image is measured by signifying the complexity of unsteady signals corresponding to the position of textline sequence of connected components in leading to determine the true text region of an input image. The performance of the approach is exhibited by presenting promising experimental results for 101 video images, standard ICDAR 2003 Scene Trial Test dataset, ICDAR 2013 dataset and on our own collected South Indian Language dataset. © 2014 King Saud University},

abstract={Thin films of BaTiO3-CuO doped with Ag have been evaluated for their carbon dioxide sensing characteristics. The effect of various parameters, such as Ag doping, annealing conditions, film thickness, electrode dimensions, and operating temperature on sensitivity has been explored. The thin films in the range of 250 nm, with 1% Ag doping and no post-deposition annealing, display the best sensitivity at an optimum operating temperature of 250 °C. We correlate sensitivity with material characteristics as determined by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope, and electron probe microscopic analysis. Sensitivity to CO2 increases with the reduction in electrode dimensions, with 500 nm electrodes giving the best sensitivity of 19% for 350 ppm and 80% for 1000 ppm of CO2.

abstract={Self-Compacting Concrete (SCC) is preferred where the construction conditions require high flow ability, stability and passing ability. In recent years, the use of SCC has been increasing. In this paper, a parametric study is conducted with the objective to find the dependency of quantities of materials used in SCC on the variation in material characteristics. The analysis is conducted based on one of the popular methods of mix design for SCC namely, the Nan Su method. Simple programs on MS Excel were made to carry out this analysis. This will help in understanding the quantities of ingredients when SCC is made using unconventional materials. Later few typical mixes are designed and tested using different fine aggregates namely crushed granite sand, granulated blast furnace sand and natural sand. In addition high volume ground granulated blast furnace slag is used as a replacement to OPC. Conclusions are drawn based on the fresh and hardened properties of SCC. From this study it can be concluded that the presently available alternative sands can be used in some combinations for producing SCC satisfying most of the properties.},

abstract={Andrographis paniculata Nees is an important medicinal plant found in the tropical regions of the world, which has been traditionally used in Indian and Chinese medicinal systems. It is also used as medicinal food. A. paniculata is found to exhibit anti-inflammatory activities; however, its inhibitory potential on inflammatory Group IIA phospholipases A2(PLA2) and its associated inflammatory reactions are not clearly understood. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the inhibitory/neutralizing potential of ethanolic extract of A. paniculata on the isolated inflammatory PLA2(VRV-PL-VIIIa) from Daboii rusellii pulchella (belonging to Group IIA inflammatory secretory PLA2[sPLA2]) and its associated edema-induced activities in Swiss albino mice. A. paniculata extract dose dependently inhibited the Group IIA sPLA2enzymatic activity with an IC50value of 10.3 ± 0.5 μg/ml. Further, the extract dose dependently inhibited the edema formation, when co-injected with enzyme indicating that a strong correlation exists between lipolytic and pro-inflammatory activities of the enzyme. In conclusion, results of this study shows that the ethanolic extract of A. paniculata effectively inhibits Group IIA sPLA2and its associated inflammatory activities, which substantiate its anti-inflammatory properties. The results of the present study warranted further studies to develop bioactive compound (s) in ethanolic extract of A. paniculata as potent therapeutic agent (s) for inflammatory diseases. © 2016 Pharmacognosy Research Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.},

abstract={The thought of taking a perfect image gives way to a plethora of ideas which work towards improving the image quality using Image Stabilization. Currently, the methods used for Optical Image Stabilization(OIS) use Motion sensors and detect vibration and correct for any jitter using VCM (Voice coil motors).The concept of the proposed work is to simulate a MEMS gyroscope and monitor the system to detect change in rotation (or any vibrations). These vibrations in turn are used to trigger a voltage pulse which is conditioned and fed into structures called comb drives which are micro structures inturn actuate on application of optimal voltages. This comb drive arrangement is made to move a lens or a sensor (depending on which type of OIS is suitable for the application) and adjust the lens such that, even if the camera shakes, the image obtained is not blurred because the setup inside the camera which captures the image also shakes, but in the opposite direction.Hence, a clear image can be obtained in a novel method using MEMS gyroscope coupled with a MEMS comb-drive actuator set-up. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Automatic speech recognition is one of the challenging area in the field of speech signal processing. Automatic speech recognition technology converts speech signal into text. This paper presents the implementation of isolated kannada word recognizer using Vector Quantization (VQ) and Fuzzy-C Means (FCM) techniques. The paper compares and contrasts the recognition accuracies of FCM and k-means techniques. It also highlights the importance of the fuzziness parameter 'm' in the FCM technique for a range of 'm' (fuzzifier) values between 1.5 to 2. The simulation analysis shows the performance of the FCM is dependent on Fuzzy parameter ('m'). It is observed that the recognition accuracies are better for FCM than VQ for clean and noisy speech signals. The results are tested and evaluated for both speaker dependent and independent speech signals. It is clear from the simulation that the recognition accuracies are better for the values of 'm' between 1.8 to 2.0. It also highlights the mathematical reason for the better accuracy of speech recognition process. Recognition accuracy obtained is 90 to 95% for clean and speaker dependent signals. 20 to 25% of recognition accuracy is obtained for noisy and speaker independent signals. © 2015 IEEE.},

This paper presents how horizontally distributed databases are mined for association rules using Fast Distributed Mining. These association rules are securely mined to get the anonymized view of the data that can be used for prediction. The databases have common attributes and databases are partitioned on those common attributes. Partitioning of large databases horizontally will result in data sets that are smaller and manageable. The efficiency will increase in terms of query execution. With horizontal partitioning, the columns will not be partitioned but rows will be split based on certain criteria so as to minimize querying across multiple partitions. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper discusses the implementation of a decision support system for the prediction of asthma in a group of children with related medical factors. The system makes use of the survey data that is gathered as part of ISAAC Phase One Study, obtained through questionnaires completed by adolescents at school and at home by the parents of the children. The model is tested on cross-sectional study data that involves two age groups. The decision support system is basically hybrid in nature as it involves the fusion of unsupervised and supervised learning techniques. As part of preprocessing, feature clustering is performed to identify the features that have a high degree of correlation with the asthma feature in the cluster. Further,this information is used to identify subject clusters by applying modified Fuzzy C Means Clustering. Clustering results are evaluated using Silhouette values. A decision tree is further constructed by using this information which in turn is used to predict the presence or absence of asthma by deploying regression.The performance of the overall model is estimated by analyzing sensitivity and specificity for the obtained prediction results which is quite satisfactory. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Lemmatizer and stemmer are the two basic modules in most of the natural language processing applications. Stemming is the process of stripping off the affixes that are present in the inflectional word to obtain stem. The extracted stem by the stemmer need not be a valid root or linguistically meaningful word. Lemmatizer removes the affixes that are present in the inflectional word by applying linguistic rules and returns the base-form or dictionary-form of the word, which is known as lemma. The split lemma is a valid root and linguistically meaningful word, hence the lemmatizer requires more linguistic knowledge than the stemmer. In linguistics, the objective of lemmatizer is to group together the different inflected forms of a word, such that these inflected words are analyzed as a common term. In this context, it is necessary to design a lemmatizer for Kannada inflectional words. In this paper we have proposed the design of rule based lemmatizer by adding set of linguistic rules to extract proper and meaningful root from Kannada inflectional word. The proposed module is tested on different types of data sets that are specifically created for this work and the accuracy obtained on these data is above 85%. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={A mild, efficient, ligand free and environmentally benign approach towards the construction of sp2 C-sp3 N bond has been developed via copper catalysed Ullmann type of coupling between 4-chlorocoumarin with N-terminus unprotected amino acids in microwave-aqua conditions, yielding a series of N-coumaryl amino acids in good to excellent yields. Excellent photo-physical properties exhibited by these N-coumaryl amino acids and their chemical applicability as C-terminus coupling partners for N-terminus peptides make them potential fluorescent probes in labelling studies. The methodology was extended towards the C-O and C-N coupling for the synthesis of fluorescent coumaryl labelled tyrosine and lysine labels respectively. Application of coumaryl labelled tyrosine was further explored towards the synthesis of fluorescent labelled opioid tetrapeptide, Endomorphin-2 derivative. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The eye center localization can be achieved using the corner detection algorithm, which is an algorithm intends to find the corner points of a face and use of corner detection algorithm is to mark a point, where the line should be drawn on parts of a face. The corner detection algorithm used in this research work performs the task of finding the corners of a face such as eyes, nose, and mouth, but the paper mainly focuses on the corners of an eye using an eye detection algorithm, as the paper intends to find the center of an eye. The eye detection algorithm is required to consider only the points of our interest. The corner points obtained using corner detection algorithm is given to eye detection algorithm, which considers only the corner points that are found near eyes, and these points are used as a reference to draw a rectangle using geometrical measurement algorithm. The geometrical measurement is another method employed in this research work to draw a rectangle around the corner points of two eyes. The output of geometrical measurement algorithm is an exact center of two eyes. All three algorithms have been linked to one another. The output of corner detection algorithm is given to eye detection algorithm, which in turn gives its output to geometrical measurements algorithm. Since there is a cascading of output from one algorithm to another, the method is collectively called as Eye Center Localization with cascaded corner detection, and geometrical measurements algorithm. The accuracy achieved during the process of localizing the center of an eye is 99.64%, which is better than other approaches to the best of our knowledge. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Telemedicine involves many people at many levels with potential access to health records or medical data or the health details of a particular person. Privacy and security have always been an issue in telemedicine. In order to overcome this problem, cloud has been adopted to store and securely access data. Cloud offers a way to allow medical data and images to be transferred from patient to medical clinicians providing security. But individual patient data is not provided with privacy when it is outsourced to public cloud. In this paper, using a case study of screening the masses for early detection of non-communicable diseases at Sri Kshetra Suttur, privacy is built into telemedicine or mobile health care system with the help of the private cloud. Efficient key generation, Encryption, Decryption and analysis of health data misuse by authenticating authorized Clinicians to access patient records using Paillier Cryptosystem and Searchable Symmetric Encryption are some of the salient features introduced in this paper. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Poor cost recovery, owing to inherent problems associated with intermittent water service, is common in the majority of towns and cities in India. The water supply in twin cities of Hubli-Dharwad, located in North Karnataka, India, was characterized by several issues such as water losses, poor service delivery, low cost recovery and low investments. Provision of water service to the twin cities was the responsibility of the Hubli-Dharwad Municipal Corporation (HDMC) until 2003. The municipal revenues were affected by the large gap between revenue and expenditure on account of poor performance of the water division of the corporation, which further impeded the efforts to improve water service. In 2003, due to deteriorating performance with regard to water supply, the Government of Karnataka transferred the responsibility for maintenance of the water service to the Karnataka Urban Water Supply & Drainage Board (KUWS&DB). The KUWS&DB along with the HDMC adopted a multi-pronged strategy to improve cost recovery. The sustained efforts for over a decade (2003-2013) led to a gradual increase in full cost recovery from about 12% in 2003 to 47% in 2013. This study examines the impact of the multi-pronged approach adopted for improving cost recovery in water supply in the twin cities. © IWA Publishing 2016.},

abstract={Banyan tree saw dust powder (BSD) filled Polypropylene (PP) green composites have been fabricated with varying amounts viz., 0%, 20%, and 40% of BSD particulate filler by using a co-rotating twin screw extruder followed by injection molding. The mechanical properties such as surface hardness, tensile behavior, and impact strength of the fabricated PP/BSD green composites have been studied in order to standardize the composites. Abrasive water jet (AWJ) machining has been reported mainly for ceramics, concrete, and glass but not much literature is available on AWJ machining of polymer composites. This research is aimed at examining the AWJ machining of green polymer composites. The effect of BSD loading on the AWJ machining behavior of the PP/BSD green composites has been investigated. Furthermore, the effect of addition of 4% maleic anhydride grafted PP (coupling agent) and 4% talc (mineral filler) on the machining behavior of PP/BSD composites has also been evaluated. Surface roughness and optical micrographs of the AWJ cut composite specimens were examined to assess the effect of BSD content, AWJ traverse speed and pressure on the machining behavior of the composites. In order to probe the mechanism of AWJ machining behavior of PP/BSD composites, the kerf width and taper have been measured and results are correlated. © 2014 Society of Plastics Engineers.},

abstract={A new simple, rapid and precise RP-HPLC method was developed for the extraction and quantitative estimation of caffeine (C), (−)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), (+)-catechin(Ct), (−)-epicatechin(EC), and (−)-epicatechin gallate (ECG) (collectively named as Tea Powder Bioactives TPBAs) extracted from tea powder using different ratios of ethanol: water. The simultaneous determination of TPBAs was performed using the UV spectrophotometric method which employs the absorbance at 205 nm (λmax of caffeine and polyphenols). This method is a gradient based HPLC method with a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min using Inertsil ODS 100 × 4.6 mm, 3 μm column with methanol and ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (pH-2.8) as mobile phase. The method was validated in terms of specificity, precision, linearity, accuracy, limit of quantification (LOQ), and limit of detection (LOD). The linearity of the proposed method was investigated for concentration ranging between 0.5–60 μg/mL with regression co-efficient, R2 = 0.999–1.0. This method estimates all the TPBAs simultaneously with enhanced precision and linearity as per the ICH guidelines. Also, to confirm the individual TPBA, the antioxidant property of the each TPBA was analyzed which was commensurate with that of the previous reports. © 2016, Association of Food Scientists & Technologists (India).},

abstract={It is the time in India to change/amend the existing standards to include artificial and recycled materials as aggregates along with natural materials. Many of the aggregates vary in composition and properties w.r.t to source and processing. Since the overall performance and durability of the construction needs to be maintained, performance based limits for alternative aggregates must be specified. The level of alternative aggregate substitution which is achievable will depend upon the properties of the aggregate, its availability in the market, the performance criteria of the mix, the whole-of-life sustainability of the product and the economic viability of its inclusion. Also, many standard test methods developed for natural aggregates have to be revised or changed (such as Magnesium/sodium sulphate soundness, aggregate expansion) in order to give relevant results when used with alternative aggregates. All aggregates in the market must meet the requirements of national standards and specifications related to both technical and environmental aspects with regard to its intended use.},

abstract={Tumors consist of multiple cell sub-populations including cancer stem cells (CSCs), transiently amplifying cells and terminally differentiated cells (TDCs), with the CSC fraction dictating the aggressiveness of the tumor and drug sensitivity. In epithelial cancers, tumor growth is influenced greatly by properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM), with cancer progression associated with an increase in ECM density. However, the extent to which increased ECM confinement induced by an increase in ECM density influences tumor growth and post treatment relapse dynamics remains incompletely understood. In this study, we use a cellular automata-based discrete modeling approach to study the collective influence of ECM density, cell motility and ECM proteolysis on tumor growth, tumor heterogeneity, and tumor relapse after drug treatment. We show that while increased confinement suppresses tumor growth and the spatial scattering of CSCs, this effect can be reversed when cells become more motile and proteolytically active. Our results further suggest that, in addition to the absolute number of CSCs, their spatial positioning also plays an important role in driving tumor growth. In a nutshell, our study suggests that, in confined environments, cell motility and ECM proteolysis are two key factors that regulate tumor growth and tumor relapse dynamics by altering the number and spatial distribution of CSCs. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The developed nanocomposite films show appreciable UVA screening efficacies as established by a novel (UV-transillumination studies) method. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) studies reveal a positive interaction between PVA matrix and incorporated nanofiller, while scanning electron microscopic (SEM) studies support uniform filler dispersions. The electronic spectral studies substantiate the changes in electronic band structure of composite films leading to appreciable changes in the optoelectronic properties. The fluorescent emission studies reveal dopant-dependent photonic emissions, while the dielectric properties, such as dielectric constant (ϵ') and dielectric loss (ϵ''), increase with an increase in filler volumes up to an optimal filler fraction (2 wt % of Ca0.2Zn0.8O) owing to the segmental motion of polymer chains in addition to interfacial polarization associated with multicomponent systems. The developed films with excellent optoelectronic properties alongside appreciable flexibilities and stretchabilities aid their applications as multifunctional UVA shielding polymeric composites with enhanced photoconductivities. © 2016 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={This paper reports, fabrication and characterization of unidirectional glass fiber reinforced epoxy composite filled with nano-size alumina, silica and micron-size alumina trihydrate fillers using pultrusion technique. Tensile, flexural and impact strengths were determined to evaluate the effectiveness of fillers on the mechanical properties. Results show that the micro and nanofillers act as secondary reinforcement. The tensile, flexural and impact strengths of 10 wt% (combined alumina, silica and alumina trihydrate)-filled glass fiber reinforced epoxy composite improved by 9, 20 and 28%, respectively, as compared to the unfilled and alumina/silica-filled glass fiber reinforced epoxy composites. The enhanced performance of micro and nanofillers-filled glass fiber reinforced epoxy composites is due to better adhesion and good dispersion of particulates in the epoxy matrix providing increased surface area for strong interfacial interaction and better load transfer. The improved mechanical properties indicate that the unidirectional glass fiber reinforced epoxy with combined micro- and nanofillers-filled composite is a good candidate for structural application. © The Author(s) 2015.},

abstract={Photocatalysed mycosynthesis of nanoparticles can be used as alternative for chemical and physical method of nanoparticle synthesis. We report synthesis of silver nanoparticles (SNPs) from two fungal species wherein the reduction in the silver ions might have occurred by nitrate-dependent reductase enzyme/proteins. Reduction in silver ions was an extracellular and made the process rapid coupled with photoreduction; it made us to the develop combination of an easy process for biosynthesis of the SNPs within 20. min. The formation of SNPs was confirmed from the surface plasmon resonance peak in the visible region of the spectrum (410-440. nm). The optimized production process shows Czapek Dox broth in alkaline pH at 60. °C of post culture temperature was found to be finest for maximum yield in both the fungal species. The particles were then characterized by UV-Visible Spectrophotometry, SEM, DLS and XRD analyses which confirm the particles are in nanoscale. The extracellular mycosynthesized SNPs were shown to have antioxidant, anti-arthritic, antiangiogenic and antimicrobial activities. The study confirms SNPs form soft corona with the human serum protein by protein corona studies. Potential of fungal-mediated biosynthesis of SNPs is important for development of effective imaging or therapeutic agents applicable for drug targeting. © 2016 The Authors.},

abstract={The automatic segmentation of pathological speech has gained importance in the field of clinical speech processing. In the disorder like stuttering, dysuencies present in continues speech are vital in deciding the severity and treatment plan. It is essential to segment these dysuencies for experimen-tal analysis. The manual segmentation method is generally followed to extract the dysuencies from the speech. In this method, dysuent instances are identiffed and segmented by carefully listening to each speech recording. This process is extremely tedious, time consuming, inconsistent and prone to random human errors. This study aims at developing al-gorithms which automatically segment the stuttered speech and select the dysuent instances present. The basic seg-mentation algorithm uses two feature extraction methods namely short-Time average magnitude and spectral spread. To categorize the dysuencies from the segmented speech maximum autocorrelation value (MACV) feature extraction technique is employed. The quality of segmentation is mea-sured based on the similarity between manual and proposed segmentation method. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={Laminates of fibre-reinforced prepreg have excellent in-plane mechanical properties, but have inadequate performance in the through thickness direction. Here, we address this issue by application of epoxy-terminated butadiene nitrile (ETBN) liquid rubber between the prepreg laminae using an automatic draw bar coating technique. Test results reveal that by adding ETBN in small quantities in the range of 9.33-61.33 g/m2, the interlaminar critical energy release rates (GIc and GIIc) are improved by up to 122% in mode-I and 49% in mode-II. Moreover, this finding is further supported by the dynamic mechanical analysis thermograms that clearly indicate that coating has not altered the Tg of ETBN-coated samples. Scanning electron microscopic analysis of fracture surfaces showed that rubber particles formed micro cavitations in the epoxy, causing localised rubber rich regions. These resin-rich regions require more energy to fracture, resulting in increased toughness of the glass epoxy prepreg systems. © SAGE Publications.},

abstract={A series of polyurethane (PU) green composites have been synthesized with varying amounts, namely 0, 2, 4, 8, and 12 wt% of soya protein isolate (SPI) by two methods. In the first method, castor oil (CO) and toluene-2,4-diisocyanate (TDI) molar ratio is CO/TDI: 1/1 with varying amounts of the SPI content. In the second method, the molar ratio of TDI is calculated by considering the -OH groups of both CO and SPI. We made the assumption that, in the first method, SPI acts as a filler and in the second method SPI is one of the coreactants in PU formation. The mechanical properties of the fabricated PU/SPI green composites are evaluated; and it is found that the tensile strength increases up to 8 wt% of SPI, and a further increase in SPI leads to reduction in the tensile strength. The small angle x-ray scattering profiles have been used to evaluate the arrangement of amorphous (A) and crystalline (C) regions in the PU/SPI green composites in a scale of about 700 Å by considering the variation in scattered intensity with scattering angles ranging from 0.3° to 1.5°. For this purpose, a linear paracrystalline model is used. In this study, the exponential distribution of phase lengths gives a good agreement between the measured and computed data on the basis of a linear paracrystal model. It is observed that there are significant changes in the distribution of phase lengths due to changes in the composition and chemical structure of PU/SPI composites obtained by methods 1 and 2. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Banana is an extensively cultivated plant worldwide, mainly for its fruit, while its ancillary product, the banana flower is consumed as a vegetable and is highly recommended for diabetics in the traditional Indian medicine system. This study is based on an investigation of the in vivo antihyperglycaemic activity of Umbelliferone (C1) and Lupeol (C2) isolated from the ethanol extract of banana flower (EF) in alloxan induced diabetic rat model. Diabetic rats which were administered with C1, C2 and EF(100 and 200mg/kg b. wt.) for 4 weeks showed deterioration in fasting hyperglycaemia and reversal of abnormalities in serum/urine protein, urea and creatinine, when compared to the diabetic control group of rats. The diabetic group of rats fed with EF, C1 and C2 (100 mg/kg b. wt.) once daily, for a period of 28 days resulted in a significant reduction of diabetic symptoms viz., polyphagia, polydipsia, polyuria and urine sugar together with an improved body weight. HbA1 c extent was reduced whereas levels of insulin and Hb were increased. Both the extract and compounds wielded positive impacts in diabetic rats by reversal of altered activities of hepatic marker enzymes viz., aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP); glycolytic enzyme (hexokinase); shunt enzyme (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase); gluconeogenic enzymes (glucose-6-phosphatase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase) and pyruvate kinase. The characteristic diabetic complications such as hypercholesterolemia and hypertriacylglycerolemia also significantly reverted to normal in the serum/liver of diabetic rats. Besides these, the treatment increased the activities of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants in the serum and liver. The histological observations revealed a marked regeneration of the β-cells in the drug treated diabetic rats. In conclusion, the present study illustrates that EF, C1 and C2 enhances the glycolytic activities, besides increasing the hepatic glucose utilization in diabetic rats by stimulating insulin secretion from the remnant β-cells along with potential enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant activities. © 2016 Ramu et al.

abstract={Geopolymer concrete is zero-Portland cement concrete containing alumino-silicate based inorganic polymer as binder. The polymer is obtained by chemical activation of alumina and silica bearing materials, blast furnace slag by highly alkaline solutions such as hydroxide and silicates of alkali metals. Sodium hydroxide solutions of different concentrations are commonly used in making GPC mixes. Often, it is seen that sodium hydroxide solution of very high concentration is diluted with water to obtain SHS of desired concentration. While doing so it was observed that the solute particles of NaOH in SHS tend to occupy lower volumes as the degree of dilution increases. This aspect is discussed in this paper. The observed phenomenon needs to be understood while formulating the GPC mixes since this influences considerably the relationship between concentration and density of SHS. This paper suggests an empirical formula to relate density of SHS directly to concentration expressed by w/w. © 2016, Società Italiana di Fisica and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) infection is one of the major causes contributing to the development of diarrhoea and mortality in new born, suckling and newly weaned piglets. To date, no preventive/treatment strategy showed promising results, which could be due to the lack of potent vaccines, and/or due to the development of resistance of ETEC to antibiotics. Therefore, in the present investigation, a novel porous sodium alginate (SA) tablet formulation loaded with F4 fimbriae antigen was developed and tested for efficacy against ETEC infections in piglet models. Precompression parameters of the powder mixes and post compression parameters of tablets have been evaluated and results were found to be satisfactory. Loading of F4 fimbrial antigens into the tablets was achieved by inducing pores in the tablets via the sublimation of camphor followed by incubation with purified F4 fimbriae. The loaded tablets have been coated with Eudragit L100 to protect the F4 fimbriae from (a) highly acidic gastric environment; (b) proteolytic cleavage by pepsin; and (c) to promote subsequent release in the intestine. Evaluation of developed F4 fimbrial tablets in a Pig model demonstrated induction of mucosal immunity, and a significant reduction of F4+ E. coli in faeces. Therefore, F4 fimbriae loaded porous tablets could be a novel oral vaccination candidate to induce mucosal and systemic immunity against ETEC infections. © 2016 Bentham Science Publishers.},

In this article, we proposed a robust algorithm to detect moving objects in a video, based on the combination of discrete cosine transform (DCT) and principal component analysis (PCA). The elementary frequency components are obtained from separable property of DCT and the dimensionality of these components is usually high. In order to reduce dimensionality and to extract effective features of the elementary frequencies, PCA approach is used. The proposed method is tested on standard PETS dataset and other real time video sequences collected from various sources.

abstract={Edible food packaging films are gaining a lot of interest as an effort to reduce packaging waste created by non-degradable conventional plastics. Edible films are those films used for coating or wrapping various foods to extend their shelf life and may be eaten together with the food. Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) is widely used as an edible film; however, it is having moderate strength and high moisture sensitivity leading to relatively high permeability. The addition of cellulose nanocrystals as a reinforcing agent in HPMC is a viable method to improve these properties. Cellulose nanocrystals obtained from food-grade bacterial cellulose fibers were incorporated into HPMC at various concentrations and the resultant nanocomposite films were characterized for its properties. Atomic Force Microscopic (AFM) images confirmed the formation of rod like cellulose nanocrystals. The addition of highly crystalline cellulose nanocrystals also helped to reduce the moisture affinity of HPMC, which is desirable for edible packaging applications. The thermal properties of these nanocomposite edible films were also evaluated. Results of this study demonstrated that bacterial cellulose nanocrystals are capable of fabricating highperformance edible polymer nanocomposite films. © 2016 by Apple Academic Press, Inc.

abstract={Platforms for publishing research papers are increasing largely that contribute to big data as their volume is humongous and are unstandardized. Classification of this huge chunk of data is one of the biggest challenges in Information Retrieval. In this paper we discuss a scoring based unsupervised learning approach to extract relevant features and classify the research papers according to their content on a two class dataset. Feature extraction is carried out by analyzing the sections of a research paper and scoring them, followed by a two level hybrid classification technique based on title and conceptual summary using graph clustering. Promising experimental results are observed for data set using our research paper classification method. We present the experimental results of our proposed algorithm for feature extraction and clustering and compare the same with different approaches reported in literature. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, an optimal switched feedback controller is designed which automatically finds a controller rather than having to make certain arbitrary choices as presented in conventional approch. This novel approach is presented for the simultaneous coordinated design of Unified power flow controller (UPFC) and Power System Stabilizer (PSS) in order to enhance the damping of oscillations in a Single Machine Infinite Bus (SMIB) power system. On the basis of the linearized Phillips-Herffron model, the coordinated design problem of PSS and UPFC is formulated as switching between two state feedback controller gains; one with respect to optimal controller and based on the location of closed loop eigenvalues from optimal control design another controller is designed using pole placement method. To ensure the betterness of simultaneous coordinated design of PSS & UPFC a preliminary control analysis is done by considering uncoordinated control of PSS & UPFC. The proposed feedback switching model presented here is tested on the modified SMIB linearised phillips heffron model of a power system using MATLAB/SIMULINKR platform.},

abstract={Many number of real time applications are available for train monitoring using satellite based navigation system with high level of speed and precision. But these systems have faced lot of issues such as multipath loss and line of sight which results in lesser accuracy measurements. When the train is moving in low satellite visible areas such as tunnels, mountains, forest etc, then no position information is available. The service failure in tunnel made big challenge to demonstrate a self supporting innovative platform for navigation of train. This paper is focused on designing a novel approach by integrating Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) system for continuous monitoring of train moving in tunnel. The wireless tracking controller based on quadratic optimal control theory is considering for analysis. Overall performance of the control design is based on Liapunov approach, where quadratic performance index is directly related to Liapunov functions. By minimizing and maximizing the performance index value corresponding to control inputs will trace the tracking error inaccuracies. As maximizing the performance index, the tracking error produces 0.04% inaccuracy. The data loss is 0.06% when minimizing the performance value.

abstract={The ability of non-viable form of Trichoderma harzianum, isolated from fluoride rich groundwater, was investigated as biosorbent for defluoridation of groundwater. Biosorption experiments were carried out at laboratory scale for removal of fluoride from groundwater. Significant effect of operational parameters on fluoride biosorption using Trichoderma harzianum as biosorbent was evaluated by varying operational parameters such as: initial fluoride concentration (2-8 mgl), biosorbent dose (0.4-1.6g/100ml), groundwater pH (6-10), temperature (30-50°C) and biosorption time (30-120 min). The fluoride adsorption isotherms were modeled by Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms. Our result showed that fluoride biosorption, significantly increased with increase in groundwater pH, biosorbent dose, temperature and biosorption time, whereas increase in initial fluoride concentration reduced fluoride removal. The fluoride biosorption was rapid and maximum fluoride uptake was attained with 1.6g 100ml biosorbent within 60 min. Optimal pH 10 and temperature 50°C gave maximum defluoridation efficiency. Freundlich isotherm fits well for defluoridation of groundwater using Trichoderma harzianum as biosorbent which indicated that biosorbent surface sites were heterogeneous in nature and fitted into heterogeneous site binding model. © Triveni Enterprises, Lucknow (India).},

abstract={The performance of fingerprint recognition system depends on the minutiae present in the fingerprint image. In most of the applications, acquired fingerprint images are of medium quality. This may not precisely extract minutiae and thereby pulls down the performance of the fingerprint recognition system. To enhance the performance, fingerprint images have to be processed before extracting minutiae. Proposed fingerprint recognition system comprises of fingerprint recognition process with minutiae matcher. It provides better performance in comparison with the existing system. Number of stages in fingerprint recognition process depends on the methodology adopted by the designer to improve the quality of the fingerprint image. One of the key contributions of the proposed system is the reduced computational complexity and processing time due to fast and improved thinning algorithm. Due to scalable hardware resources supported by Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) further improvement in the processing time is possible. Validation of the fingerprint recognition system is carried out in terms of false acceptance rate (FAR) and false rejection rate (FRR). State-of-the-art fingerprint recognition system with improved recognition rate is implemented on Virtex-5 FPGA development board. The system is validated for 500 samples of medium quality fingerprint images generated by considering people between age 5-65 using optical scanner. Further, the results obtained from hardware design are compared with that of earlier work implemented on different platforms.},

abstract={Minimization of delay in collecting the data at any base stations is one of the major concerns in cluster based Wireless Mesh Networks. several researches have proposed algorithms to control congestion considering static nature of a node. Mobility of a node results in high congestion due to frequent link breakages and high energy consumption due to re-establishment of route during routing process. Hence, the authors consider dynamic nodes with single hop inside the static cluster. The proposed model includes four modules namely, Cluster head selection, slot allocation, slot scheduling and data collection process. the cluster head selection is based on the maximum energy, number of links and link duration. Slot allocation is based on the available energy () and the required energy (). Slot scheduling is carried out based on the link duration. Data at the base station will be collected as they are scheduled. Model is tested using Network Simulator-3 (NS3) and results indicate that the proposed model achieves least delay besides reducing the congestion compared to the existing methods. © Copyright 2016, IGI Global.},

abstract={Objectives: To do the mechanical characterization of the composite developed by reinforcing the Grey Cast Iron (GCI) in AA6061. Methods/Statistical Analysis: An aging study was carried out on specimens of plain AA6061 matrix alloy and GCI reinforced AA6061 composite. Initially, samples were solution treated for 2 h at 550°C, then quenching in water followed by artificial aging at 160°C for different aging times. In the present study microstructure, hardness, tensile and impact properties of AA6061 based composite reinforced with GCI are analyzed as cast and in peak aged conditions. Findings: The presence of Grey Cast Iron in the matrix has resulted in improvement of the mechanical properties of the composite. The micrographs of the composite revealed a uniform distribution of the particles in the matrix. Comparison of the characteristics before and after heat treatment was done and it was found that there is an improvement in hardness, tensile strength of the composites as well as AA6061 alloy after heat treatment. It is found that the impact resistance reduces as the quantity of reinforcement is increased and also the cast specimens had better impact resistance than the peak aged category. Lowering of impact resistance is due to the loss of matrix ductility. Application/Improvements: The GCI reinforced particulate composites have been proved to be most suitable for heat and wear resistance applications.},

abstract={Use of manufactured sand in masonry, plaster and concrete is significantly increasing in India owing to the scarcity of natural river sand. MS is the product of rock crushing and sieving. The crushing process tends to increase the amount of fines which mainly depends on the type of crushing unit and the operations involved. Amount of fines increases the water demand for a given workability. Most of the MS in India supplied by local crushers is flakey and elongated. In addition MS produced from industrial by products will have more irregular surface characteristics, which increases the water demand further. The amount of fines and the irregular surface characteristics of MS tend to decrease the uncompacted density which increases the internal voids. Thus in the present investigation, five samples of MS and three samples of river sand obtained from different sources are considered for the characterization based on the uncompacted void content as per ASTM C 1252. The equipment was fabricated as per the code and all tests as per the code were conducted. Based on the test results it can be concluded that the MS or any type of sand can be easily characterized to know its performance in concrete. These tests also helps manufacturer to control the crushing process to enhance the quality of MS. Copyright © 2016 ACC Limited.},

abstract={In 2D shape recognition and retrieval approach using shape feature extraction, statistical shape analysis methods such as PCA, ICA and NMF are commonplace, and these methods using subspace approach, have not been adequately investigated for recognition and retrieval of 2D shapes. The main hurdle in achieving higher recognition efficiency seems to be the shape sensitivity. In this paper we suggest, subspace method approach. The main idea is to use modular technique to improve the recognition and retrieval efficiency. Normally in the earlier methods proposed so far, a complete image is considered in training and matching process, in modular method approach partial image is used for training and matching the 2D images. The recognition and retrieval process is carried out in two phase, in the first phase uses the ridgelet transform applied. The second phase PCA is used for dimensionality reduction and to extract the effective features. For recognition and retrieval a study was conducted by using seventeen different distance measure technique. The training and testing process is conducted using leave-one-out strategy. The retrieval process is carried out by considering standard test “bull eyes” score. The proposed method is tested on the standard dataset MPEG-7. The experiment results of Subspace ridgelet PCA are compared with Subspace PCA method. © Springer India 2016.},

abstract={Wireless mesh networks (WMN) possess characteristics such as self-healing, self-configuring and self-discovery. Due to this nature WMN has emerged as the most widely used popular network. Since these devices are operated using battery resources, several works have been carried out for minimizing energy consumption during routing process, thereby increasing network lifetime. WMNs are more vulnerable for attackers due to its wide usage. Many works can be found to detect the intruder during routing without considering energy as a metric. There exist possibilities of intruder to attack the battery resource thereby reducing network efficiency in energy-aware routing. Hence in this work we propose a novel approach to detect an intruder by self-monitoring mechanism of node considering metrics such as packet size, data rate, remaining energy and draining rate of a energy resources of a node. The proposed model consists of three modules, namely self-intrusion detector, monitor and evaluator. It detects and helps in making decisions to participate in the network transmission. The working of the model is analyzed and shows that the proposed model detects intruder effectively, thereby resulting in increase of WMN efficiency. © Springer India 2016.},

abstract={Use of nano-size particles against pathogenic bacteria is a rapidly growing area due to their unique physico-chemical properties. The present investigation reports the synthesis of silver nanobactericides by Aneurinibacillus migulanus, a novel endophyte isolated from surface sterilized inner leaf segment of Mimosa pudica L. and cultured at large scale to separate cell free extract which was treated with metal salt silver nitrate to synthesize silver nanobactericides. The synthesized nanobactericides were subjected to biophysical characterization using UV-visible spectra with characteristic absorption peaks between 350 and 550nm. The role of biomolecules mediating the synthesis and stabilizing the nanobactericides was studied with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR), which suggested the presence of carbonyl, aromatic, amino and secondary aliphatic groups bound to surface of nanobactericides. Bragg's peaks with different intensities exhibited the standard diffraction pattern of the silver plane, corresponding to the crystalline nature of the nanobactericides. The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis revealed presence of high intense absorption peak at 3keV is a typical characteristic of nano-crystalline silver which confirmed the presence of elemental silver. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed polydispersity of nanobactericides with size ranging from 20 to 60nm. The particle size determined by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) method revealed average size to be 24.27nm. Further, using in vitro assays, silver nanobactericides showed potent activity against five different bacterial species, including human pathogens. The silver nanobactericides caused DNA damage against the test bacteria, suggesting the possible mode of action. To best of our knowledge this is the first report of A. migulanus as an endophyte and its ability to reduce silver nitrate to synthesize silver nanobactericides. © 2016.},

abstract={Hygroscopic moisture content of fine-grained soil represents the water adsorbed by the negatively charged clay platelets when the oven-dried soil is exposed to an atmosphere with different levels of humidity, which is a variable. Hygroscopic moisture content has been linked with many clay mineralogical parameters in predictive geotechnical engineering. However, there appears to be no standard codal provisions to quantify this property. This paper uses the modified rectangular hyperbolic representation of the adsorbed water content against time of exposure to an environment with 100% relative humidity relationship to quantify the hygroscopic moisture content. The proposed method is very simple and fairly accurate. The hygroscopic moisture contents so predicted corresponding to 100% relative humidity have been shown to have one-to-one correspondence with the values obtained through actual time-consuming measurements. By virtue of common dependency factors, it is shown that the hygroscopic moisture content at 100% relative humidity of fine-grained soils can be uniquely related with their liquid limits and equilibrium sediment volumes. Furthermore, instead of a time-consuming method of determining the hygroscopic moisture content, a simple method of predicting the same knowing their liquid limits has been proposed.

abstract={The aim of the current investigation is to evaluate the efficiency of tertiary butyl hydroquinone (TBHQ) as an antioxidant in edible oil like palm oil (Elaeis guineensis) by physical, chemical and ultrasonic properties. The effects of the varying amounts of TBHQ on the oxidation stability of palm oil have been investigated. The antioxidant incorporated palm oil system and control oil were subjected to heating at 180 ± 5 °C continuously for a period of 4 h per day for 4 days consecutively. The parameters used to assess the thermal degradation and oxidation properties of the palm oil include ultrasonic velocity, viscosity and density. Adiabatic compressibility, intermolecular free length, relaxation time, and acoustic impedance have been calculated from experimental data. The effect of thermal ageing on the physical properties of the oil was confirmed by chemical analysis, which included free fatty acid, total polar compounds, and estimation of fatty acids profile by gas chromatography (GC). The chemical changes were studied by FT-IR bands. The results obtained from ultrasonic studies have shown improvement in oxidative stability and retardation in thermal degradation of the antioxidant-loaded oil in comparison with the base oil. Hence, the ultrasonic velocity and acoustical parameters used for assessment of stability of frying oil and palm oil with TBHQ can be recommended for repeated frying without adverse effects on the physical properties.},

abstract={Learning in an organization takes place at the individual, group and organizational levels. There is an upsurge of interest among researchers in issues of collective learning. Spirituality at work, also a multi-level phenomenon, manifests at both the individual and the collective levels. Spirituality at work is about search for meaning or higher purpose, connectedness and transcendence. Spirituality is recognized as a major factor in learning at the individual level. However, the expression and impact of spirituality need to be examined at the collective level. The present research addresses this conceptual and empirical gap using the concept of spiritual climate and examines its impact on learning in teams. This relationship is proposed based on theories of learning in teams, flow, social learning and levels of learning. Various aspects of spiritual climate are found to have positive association with learning in teams in the present study. These findings have theoretical and practical implications on organization development, corporate social responsibility and learning at workplace. © 2016, 2016 IMI.},

abstract={The effect of repeated heating process on edible oils namely, sesame oil (SO), sunflower oil (SFO) and palm oil (PO) with and without antioxidant, tertiary butyl hydroquinone (TBHQ) have been evaluated using ultrasonic velocity. The changes in physico-chemical properties of edible oils has been studied during repeated heating at 180 ± 5°C for 4 hrs/day and for 4 days. The effect of antioxidant, in edible oils on the thermal oxidation behavior has been studied for repeated heating process. The thermal degradation of oils have been evaluated for physical properties such as ultrasonic velocity, viscosity, density and secondary parameters like adiabatic compressibility, intermolecular free length, relaxation time and acoustic impedance. Chemical changes were studied by free fatty acid, total polar compounds and the changes in the unsaturation level of fatty acids were confirmed by gas chromatographic (GC) analysis. The repeated heating process had effect on the physical properties of oil, which is due to the decrease in unsaturated fatty acid composition and other chemical changes. It is observed that all three control oils properties significantly deteriorate on repeated heating. The oils with TBHQ don't cause significant changes on the physico-chemical properties and ultrasonic properties. This result clearly indicates that oils with 200 ppm TBHQ are found to be more thermally stable. © 2008 IFRJ.},

The synthesized silver nanoparticles were subjected to biophysical characterization using hyphenated techniques. The possible role of biomolecules in mediating the synthesis was depicted with FTIR analysis. Further crystalline nature of synthesized nanoparticles was confirmed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) with prominent diffraction peaks at 2θ which can be indexed to the (111), (200), (220), and (311) reflections of face centered cubic structure (fcc) of metallic silver. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed morphological characteristics of synthesized silver nanoparticles to be polydisperse in nature with size ranging from 10 to 60 nm and different morphological characteristics such as spherical, oval, hexagonal, and cubic shapes. Further silver nanoparticles exhibited bactericidal activity against panel of significant pathogenic bacteria among which Pseudomonas aeruginosa was most sensitive compared to other pathogens.

abstract={Background and Objectives: Adhesion and colonization are prerequisites for the establishment of bacterial pathogenesis. The biofilm development of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was assessed on adhesive surfaces like dialysis membrane, stainless steel, glass and polystyrene. Materials and Methods: Microtiter plate biofilm assay was performed to assess the effect of nutrient medium and growth parameters of P. aeruginosa. Further, its growth on adhesive surfaces namely hydrophilic (dialysis membrane) and hydrophobic (polystyrene plate, square glass and stainless steel coupon) was assessed. The exopolysaccharide (EPS) was quantified using ruthenium red microplate assay and microscopic analysis was used to observe P. aeruginosa biofilm architecture. The anti-biofilm activity of herbal extracts on mature P. aeruginosa was performed. Results: The formation of large scale biofilms on dialysis membrane for 72 h was proved to be the best surface. In microscopic studies, very few exopolysaccaride fibrils, indicating a rather loose matrix was observed at 48 h. Further, thick exopolysaccaride, indicated higher adhesive properties at 72 h which is evident from ruthenium red staining. Among the plant extract used, Justicia wynaadensis leaf and Aristolochia indica (Eswari) root extract showed significant reduction of anti-biofilm activity of 0.178 OD and 0.192 OD in inhibiting mature biofilms at 0.225 OD respectively, suggesting the possible use of these extracts as efficient anti-adhesive and biofilm-disrupting agents with potential applications in controlling biofilms on surfaces. Conclusion: Our study facilitates better understanding in the development of P. aeruginosa biofilms on different food processing and clinical surfaces ultimately taking care of food safety and hygiene. © 2016, Tehran University of Medical Science.

abstract={In the present work, we report on the biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using leaf extract of Convolvulus pluricaulis (Shankapushpi, bindweed) at room temperature. Synthesis of AgNPs is carried out by incubating the leaf extract in presence of AgNO3. Formation of AgNPs is confirmed by the appearance of a prominent surface plasmon resonance band in the UV-visible spectrum at 420 nm. The biosynthesized AgNPs are characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential thermo gravimetric (DTG) analysis. Further, the biosynthesized AgNPs are investigated for their catalytic, electrocatalytic and phenol remediation properties. The investigations revealed that the biosynthesized AgNPs excel in their respective applications. Based on the results, present study concludes that AgNPs can be biosynthesized using leaf extract of Convolvulus pluricaulis and further can be employed for applications in electrochemical sensing, dye degradation and phenol remediation. © 2016 VBRI Press.},

abstract={The present research deals with the treatment of agri-based pulp and paper mill wastewater by continuous electrocoagulation (CEC) process using iron (Fe) as an electrode material. Effects of flow rates (dm3 h-1): 0.5-4.0 and residence time (τ): 0.5-4.0 h were investigated on degradation of chemical oxygen demand (COD), color, total solid (TS), turbidity, specific energy consumption (SEC), instantaneous current efficiency (ICE) and electrochemical degradation index (EDI). At flow rates of 1.0 and 0.5 dm3 h-1, COD removal efficiency of 78.20 and 82.15%; and color removal efficiency of 79 and 90%, respectively, was achieved. TS concentration of wastewater slurry was also reduced by 65% after 3 h residence time with flow rate of 1 dm3 h-1. The specific energy consumption (kW h per kgCODremoved) was decreased from 16.3 to 14.3 with decrease in τ from 4 to 1 h. At a supply charge concentration of 0.62 A h dm-3, the current efficiency (CE) values were 310% and 274% after τ = 2 and 1 h, respectively. Dissolution and consumption of electrodes were also studied with a change in flow rates. Sludge obtained after the CEC process was analyzed for settling and filterability characteristics, morphology and elemental analysis, point of zero charge, physicochemical and elemental characterization, and TS concentration. The operating cost of the process was also calculated based on the electrical energy and electrode consumption and was found to be 61.0 Indian Rupees (0.9 USD) for the treatment of 1 m3 of wastewater. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.},

abstract={In this paper, we present an accurate detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) from structural MRI using an Extended Metacognitive Radial Basis Function Neural Classifier (EMcRBFN). An automatic whole brain Voxel Based Morphometry (VBM) approach is used to identify gray matter composition in the brain from structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and an improved q-Gaussian classifier and its metacognitive learning algorithm has been proposed to approximate the functional relationship between the high dimensional VBM features and the true class labels. Recent genetic studies indicate that ASD manifests in different ways between males and females and also between adolescents and adults. Accordingly, the proposed EMcRBFN classifier has been evaluated using the publicly available Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange dataset with a comprehensive study on both males and females and also between adolescents and adults in both categories. EMcRBFN classifier performance is compared with currently existing results for ASD classification in the literature and also with well known standard classifiers. The results clearly indicate that the performance of the EMcRBFN classifier is better than that of the other classifiers considered in this study. Further, the comprehensive study also indicates that the following subregions in the brain viz., premotor cortex and supplementary motor cortex are affected for adult-females while the somatosensory cortex subregion is affected for adolescent-females with ASD. Similar results indicate that the precentral gyrus, motor cortex, medial frontal gyrus and the paracentral lobule areas are affected for adolescent males while the superior frontal gyrus and the frontal eye fields areas are affected for adult males with ASD. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Chrysanthemum chlorotic mottle viroid (CChMVd, genus Pelamoviroid, family Avsunviroidae) has been reported to infect chrysanthemum (Dendranthema x grandiflorum). CChMVd was first reported in 1967 in the cultivar Yellow Delaware in New York State, USA (Dimock et al. 1971). Presence of CChMVd has previously been recorded, based on the symptoms and bioassay, in India (Singh et al. 1978). Karnataka State of India is the prominent chrysanthemum-growing region, with 19,161 ha cultivated under this crop and accounting for more than 40% of country’s flower production. During late summer 2010 (May and June), chrysanthemum leaves with yellow-green mottling and chlorotic spots were noted, indicating the possible association with CChMVd in Karnataka. Total RNA was extracted using a 2% CTAB buffer from leaf samples of symptomatic plants (Adkar-Purushothama et al. 2013). For the detection of CChMVd, reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was performed using PIII/PIV as described previously (De la Peña et al. 1999). PCR products of the expected sizes (∼398 to 401 bp) were cloned and sequenced. BLAST analysis of the obtained sequences confirmed the presence of CChMVd in Karnataka. In order to estimate the incidence of CChMVd, the same RT-PCR assay was performed on 80 randomly selected chrysanthemum leaf samples of four different cultivars (Redgold, Bangalore, Sarval, and CO-1) collected from four chrysanthemum-growing districts of Karnataka. A PCR product of the size expected for CChMVd was detected in 8 of 80 samples analyzed, accounting for the infection incidence of 10%. To identify the prominent CChMVd variants, 10 clones obtained from the four representative samples were sequenced. To confirm the sequence of the primer regions, an additional set of primers CCh1/CCh2 were used for RT-PCR (Hosokawa et al. 2005) with high-fidelity LA-Taq polymerase (Takara-Bio, Japan). Alignment of all 40 sequences revealed the presence of at least two major sequence variants of CChMVd: CChMVd-Ind-1 (GenBank Accession No. KP262531) and CChMVd-Ind-3 (KP262533). Both the sequence variants had UUUC sequences (nucleotide position 82 to 85) in the tetraloop of the CChMVd, which is often associated with induction of symptoms in susceptible chrysanthemum cultivars (De la Peña et al. 1999). CChMVd-Ind-1was found to differ from CChMVd-Ind-3 by 17 nucleotide substitutions. BLAST analysis of CChMVd-Ind-1 showed 98% sequence identity with the CChMVd strain reported from Spain (GenBank Accession No. FJ647515) and from Himachal Pradesh state of India (FN646404), whereas CChMVd-Ind-3 showed 96% sequence identity with CChMVd strain W2-4, isolated from China (HQ891014). To our knowledge, this is the first molecular evidence for the presence of CChMVd infecting chrysanthemum in Karnataka State, India. The high degree of sequence diversity reported in the Karnataka isolates of CChMVd will help to clarify the evolution of this viroid and its possible threat to important crops. © 2015 The American Phytopathological Society.},

abstract={The innovations in the realm of music signal processing insist on adept music information retrieval (MIR) techniques. In this paper, we propose a query by humming (QBH) MIR system for retrieving the desired song based on enhanced perceptual feature set, context drift information (CDI) and humming query (HQ). In the proposed system, eight perceptual features corresponding to four perceptual properties are extracted. Subsequently, the CDI of these features is analysed and estimated through the perceptual transfer entropy (PTE) measure. Then, the perceptual feature space and PTE trajectory of the target music database is matched with the HQ. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is substantiated with series of experiments, consisting of 1,200 songs target database and 200 HQs. The target database of 1,200 songs is converted into 1,495 fragments by splitting each song into several small proportions. The results show that the proposed method effectively finds the target song with HQ as input. © 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={This paper presents an automatic, non-invasive method for detecting Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) among males using structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Whole brain Voxel Based Morphometry (VBM) analysis is first used to identify the brain regions that are affected for ASD patients and gray matter probability in these regions are used as features for classification. In contrast to existing studies which are small in scale, this paper presents a large scale study using the publicly available dataset from Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange. Taking a cue from genetic studies which indicate that ASD manifests differently among males and females, this paper considers males only. Even among males, this study shows that better classification accuracy can be achieved by considering adult and adolescent males separately. By using a Metacognitive Radial basis Function Network classifier, classification accuracy of 59.73%, 61.49% and 70.41% is achieved when considering all males, adolescent males and adult males respectively. This is about (5 to 10%) higher than Support Vector Machine classifier which is commonly used in literature for this problem and about (6 to 15%) higher than Naive Bayes classifier. It is also found that all three classifiers perform better when considering adult and adolescent males separately instead of considering all males together underscoring the need to consider different age-groups separately for ASD detection. VBM analysis indicates that the precentral gyrus, motor cortex, medial frontal gyrus and the paracentral lobule areas are possibly affected for adolescent males with ASD while the superior frontal gyrus and the frontal eye fields areas are possibly affected for adult males with ASD. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents an approach for automatic diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) among males using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). fMRI has the capability to identify any abnormal neural interactions that may be responsible for behavioral symptoms observed in ASD patients. In this paper, the regional homogeneity of the voxels in the 116 regions of the automated anatomical labeling (AAL) atlas of the brain are used as features which result in a large set of 54837 features. Chi-square feature selection method is then used to identify the most significant features and only these features are then used for classification with a metacognitive radial basis function classifier. Since genetic studies have indicated that ASD manifests differently in males and females, a large scale study specific to males is highlighted here using the publicly available preprocessed fMRI dataset from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE), unlike existing studies which are either smaller in scale or consider both males and females together. Among the males, it is shown here that the classification performance can be improved (by up to 10%) by considering adults and adolescents separately. By using Chi-square algorithm the number of features was reduced drastically to lower than 200 in contrast to the thousands of features that have been used in recent studies. © 2015 IEEE.},

The present simulation work with FDM is computationally simple as one grid is employed for solving the Poisson's equation and Current continuity equation which gives sufficiently accurate results. Further, V-I measurements for one of the ESPs were conducted by the author at Raichur Thermal Power Station (RTPS) in India and the simulated results were compared with the measured ones.

abstract={One of the current needs of the Indian government system is to provide equal medical services and facilities for both urban and remote/rural areas. But unfortunately this need has not been achieved till today hence people living in remote/rural areas are needed to go to urban areas to seek doctor to get preliminary treatment for their common diseases like fever, typhoid, dengue, malaria, chikungunya and so on in order to get proper guidance and treatment at an earlier stage itself. But these people cannot able to get preliminary treatment for their common diseases because along with medical expenses travelling expenses will also be included, which cannot be offered by these people. Travel also includes the risk of road traffic, accident and can make worse the medical condition of a person and sometimes it may lead to death also. This work has focused on this aspect by developing a client application and a server application. The client application allows the health worker to collect the symptoms and other necessary information about a patient in the remote/rural areas and then to send that information to the server application in the form of a Short Message Service (SMS). The server application in the urban area interprets the received message and generates the prescription automatically based on the symptoms of a patient and allows the doctor to view and to validate the generated prescription based on the symptoms and previous prescription details of a patient, if any, and finally to send the validated prescription to the health worker in the form of an SMS (which will finally reach the patient). The server application also allows the doctor to send any informative messages to the health worker in the form of an SMS (which will finally reach the people living in remote/rural areas). © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Polymer nanocomposites for electro-optics are known to offer novel material morphologies and unique device geometries, thereby enhancing the device performance. In this study, we report the successful fabrication of one such blue-green fluorescent poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)/cesium zincate (Cs<inf>2</inf>ZnO<inf>2</inf>) nanocomposite by solution intercalation technique. The optoelectronic properties of prepared films were probed with the intent to establish the effect of nanointegrates on optical and electrical characteristics of particle stabilizing PVA. The optical absorbance studies revealed the UV absorbent nature of PVA/Cs<inf>2</inf>ZnO<inf>2</inf> films exhibiting a steep UV absorption coupled with high visible transmission. The optical parameters of nanocomposite films, including absorption/extinction coefficients, optical band gap, complex refractive index (RI), and dielectric functions besides optical conductivity were evaluated, which supports the dopant-dependent optical properties of PVA with a scope for band gap engineering. The dispersion and functionalization of nanofillers were characterized by FESEM. The integrated fillers induced a broad blue-green luminescence (2.88-2.58 eV) in the emission spectrum of PVA. The structural aspects were probed by FTIR studies, while charge transport properties were valued by dielectric studies. The dielectric properties (dielectric storage and dielectric loss), AC conductivity, and charge dissipation were found to increase with nanofiller content and decrease with frequency. © 2015 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Ethnaopharmacologial relevance: Turmeric rhizome is a traditional herbal medicine, which has been widely used as a remedy to stop bleeding on fresh cuts and for wound healing by the rural and tribal population of India. Aim of the study: To validate scientific and therapeutic application of turmeric rhizomes to stop bleeding on fresh cuts and its role in wound healing process. Materials and methods: The water extracts of thoroughly scrubbed and washed turmeric rhizomes viz., Curcuma aromatica Salisb., Curcuma longa L., Curcuma caesia Roxb., Curcuma amada Roxb. and Curcuma zedoria (Christm.) Roscoe. were subjected to salting out and dialysis. The dialyzed crude enzyme fractions (CEFs) were assessed for proteolytic activity using casein as substrate and were also confirmed by caseinolytic zymography. Its coagulant activity and fibrinogenolytic activity were assessed using human citrated plasma and fibrinogen, respectively. The type of protease(s) in CEFs was confirmed by inhibition studies using specific protease inhibitors. Results: The CEFs of C. aromatica, C. longa and C. caesia showed 1.89, 1.21 and 1.07 folds higher proteolytic activity, respectively, compared to papain. In contrast to these, C. amada and C. zedoria exhibited moderate proteolytic activity. CEFs showed low proteolytic activities compared to trypsin. The proteolytic activities of CEFs were confirmed by caseinolytic zymography. The CEFs of C. aromatica, C. longa and C. caesia showed complete hydrolysis of Aα, Bβ and γ subunits of human fibrinogen, while C. amada and C. zedoria showed partial hydrolysis. The CEFs viz., C. aromatica, C. longa, C. caesia, C. amada and C. zedoria exhibited strong procoagulant activity by reducing the human plasma clotting time from 172 s (Control) to 66 s, 84 s 88 s, 78 s and 90 s, respectively. The proteolytic activity of C. aromatica, C. longa, C. caesia and C. amada was inhibited (>82%) by PMSF, suggesting the possible presence of a serine protease(s). However, C. zedoria showed significant inhibition (60%) against IAA and moderate inhibition (30%) against PMSF, indicating the presence of cysteine and serine protease(s). Conclusion: The CEFs of turmeric species exhibited strong procoagulant activity associated with fibrinogenolytic activity. This study provides the scientific credence to turmeric in its propensity to stop bleeding and wound healing process practiced by traditional Indian medicine. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract={There are several approximate methods available for the estimation of fundamental period of layered soil deposits. Approximate methods based on weighted average of shear wave velocities of the layered soil profile are most widely employed in practice. On the other hand, methods which are more accurate are tedious and iterative in procedure; hence they are unpopular for quick estimation of fundamental period of soil deposits. A new method for computing the fundamental period of multilayered soil deposit is proposed in the present study. In this method, layered shear wave velocity profile is replaced with an equivalent linearly varying profile. Subsequently, based on analytical solution for fundamental period of the deposit with linearly varying shear wave velocity profile, an equation to estimate the fundamental period of the actual layered soil deposit is proposed. The efficiency of the proposed method and other available methods is relatively verified by comparing their results with values computed from recorded earthquake accelerograms of instrumented geotechnical downhole arrays. This comparative study, establishes accuracy and consistency of the proposed method vis-à-vis exact methods. © 2014, Indian Geotechnical Society.},

abstract={Various water supply mechanisms prevail in Hubli-Dharwad, a Tier-2 city in Karnataka State of India, wherein, piped water does not cover the entire city. Since 2008, Karnataka State Government's demonstration project with World Bank assistance has been serving about 10 per cent of the entire population with 24?7 water service. A majority of the population on the city outskirts with no consistent water service faced hardships in obtaining water through bore wells, public stand posts, and from private vendors at exorbitant prices. Lack of tenure and the inability to pay connection fees were some of the barriers that precluded the urban poor from having a water connection. The local corporation faced poor revenues exhibiting poor performance. This paper discusses how innovative approaches were devised and implemented using local knowledge to address such barriers and increase water access. We also discuss how the local revenues improved and were used to provide cross-subsidies to the urban poor. © Practical Action Publishing, 2015.},

abstract={The aim of the current investigation is to evaluate the efficiency of tertiary butyl hydroquinone (TBHQ) as an antioxidant in sesame oil (sesamum indicum) by density, viscosity and ultrasonic velocity. The effects of varying amounts of TBHQ on the oxidation stability of sesame oil have been investigated. The antioxidant incorporated sesame oil system and control edible oil were subjected to heating at 180 ± 5 °C continuously for a period of 4 h per day for consecutive 4 days. The parameters used to assess the thermal degradation and oxidation properties of the oils include ultrasonic velocity, viscosity, density and peroxide value. The fatty acid compositions of the oils were measured by gas chromatography. Adiabatic compressibility, intermolecular free length, relaxation time and acoustic impedance have been calculated from experimental data. Viscosity, density and ultrasonic velocity change in control oil is from 3.6553 × 10−2 to 11.1729 × 10−2 Nsm−2, 912.59 to 940.31 kg/m3 and 1,421 to 1,452 m/s respectively and in sesame oil with 200 ppm TBHQ is from 3.6793 × 10−2 to 6.4842 × 10−2 Nsm−2, 913.78 to 922.45 kg/m3 and 1,421 to 1,431 m/s respectively for 16 h of heat treated oil. The ultrasonic results obtained have shown reduction in thermal degradation and improvement in oxidation stability of antioxidant loaded oil in comparison to base oil. Hence, it can be recommended that sesame oil with 200 ppm TBHQ can be used for frying without adverse effect on physical properties. The ultrasonic velocity can be used for assessment of stability of frying oil. © 2014, Association of Food Scientists & Technologists (India).},

abstract={An Energy efficient routing protocol is one of the major concerns of Wireless Mesh Networks(WMN). Nodes of WMN works based on the limited battery power routing protocol has to be designed such that it utilize minimum battery power and route the data efficiently and thus maximize the overall life time of the network. Many existing works shows the efficient usage of battery during the selection of Cluster Head(CH) in clusters. To increase the lifetime, provide scalability and energy efficiency during routing we propose energy optimized path selection protocol that uses Draining Rate (DR) as parameter. The proposed Maximum Remaining energy Minimum Draining rate-Cluster Head(MRMD-CH) selection protocol selects CH based on the maximum remaining energy(Max RE) and minimum battery draining rate (Min DR) of energy resource. The protocol predicts nodes draining rate and based on the result obtained it selects the CH with sufficient energy and low energy depletion rate. The Protocol is evaluated under static nature of nodes. Simulation is carried out in NS3 and results shows that the proposed model efficiently uses the limited battery power of WMN and results in increase in the lifetime of network. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Over the last few years the interactive segmentation method became very popular in medical image processing and analysis due to user intervention in the segmentation process. Segmentation of vertebral discs is a difficult task in the area of medical image processing. Currently there are limited numbers of techniques used in vertebral MRI segmentation scenario. Back pain is a common health problem among people, which is mainly due to the herniated vertebral discs in the vertebral column. Vertebral MRI segmentation can be used to detect the herniated discs. Through this paper, we are implementing a novel interactive segmentation method for the diagnosis of inter-vertebral discs in the lumbar spine MRI. Here we are using grow-cut method for segmentation. Since grow-cut segmentation is a semi automated (interactive) method, user can define certain seed pixels in an image. This provides an idea about the interested and unwanted regions for the segmentation of an image. The segmented image is further processed by median filter in order to preserve the edges of the image. The diagnosis is done by extracting the features such as area and shape of inter-vertebral discs. The method is then tested and validated against a dataset containing 23 subjects and obtained an accuracy of 97.22% and sensitivity of 83.33%. © Research India Publications.},

In order to cluster the term frequency vectors, we make use of Multiple Kernel Fuzzy C-Means (MKFCM). After clustering, term frequency vector of each cluster are used to form a interval valued representation (symbolic representation) by the use of mean and standard deviation. Further, interval value features are stored in knowledge base as a representative of the cluster. To corroborate the efficacy of the proposed model, we conducted extensive experimentation on standard datset like Reuters- 21578 and 20 Newsgroup. We have compared our classification accuracy achieved by the Symbolic classifier with the other existing Naive Bayes classifier, KNN classifier and SVM classifier. The experimental result reveals that the classification accuracy achieved by using symbolic classifier is better than other three classifiers. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={Traditionally, different parts of plants such as bark, stem, and leaves have been used in wound healing. Around 10% of the angiosperm plants produce a natural polymer from specialized laticiferous cells called latex. The major role played by the latex is in wound healing and defensive mechanism against infectious diseases in plants. In the past 20 y, with biochemical and pharmacological characterization of plant latex it has come to light that proteases are involved in wound healing. Some have been extensively studied with characterization while some are yet to be explored. This review conglomerates the reports of different families of laticiferous plants studied scientifically for wound care. The review also emphasizes on the methodology to be adopted in accessing the proteases studied for procoagulant and thrombolytic activities. Emphasis was given on the all possible reports on laticiferous plants in wound healing with thorough literature survey from sources viz., PubMed and Google Scholar. However, research on latex protease is still in budding stage. Adopting the proteases having promising applicability in wound care needs to be focussed. © 2015, International Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Science. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In today's world, there is an explosive growth of data from terabytes to petabytes in the internet. The major problem is not the availability of data but starving for knowledge from the data. Sentiment analysis is an important current research area in the field of web content mining. Sentiment analysis and opinion mining is the study that analyzes people's opinions, sentiments, evaluations, attitudes, and emotions from written language. In this paper, we extend our ideas pertaining to Sentiment Analysis to the regional language Kannada, spoken mainly in Karnataka, a state in southern part of India. We have explored the usefulness of semantic approaches and machine learning approaches, used predominately on English language data set, from Kannada web documents. We found the average accuracy of machine learning approaches to be better than the average accuracy of semantic learning approaches for Kannada data set. © 2015 The Authors.},

abstract={Sentiment Analysis (SA) is a very popular research area in the field of text mining as its computational capabilities have found a lot of research applications. Sentiment Prediction,Subjectivity Detection,Text summarization,Sentiment Summarization for Opinions etc. are some example applications. There are many research studies in the area of SA in different languages. However, Kannada SA has not been explored extensively and in particular, for the analysis of product reviews. In this paper, a case study of Kannada SA for mobile product reviews is proposed as there are many user generated Kannada product reviews available online. In this approach a lexicon based method for aspect extraction has been developed. Furthermore, the Naive Bayes classification model is applied to analyze the polarity of the sentiment due to its computational simplicity and stochastic robustness. This is the first attempt in Kannada to the best of author's knowledge. Therefore, a customized corpus has been developed. The weekly reviews from the column 'Gadget Loka' by U.B Pavanaja are considered to develop this corpus. The source for this is the famous Kannada news paper 'Prajavani'. The preliminary results indicate this approach is an efficient technique for Kannada SA. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={It is generally acknowledged that recognition and classification of dysfluencies are an important criterion in the objective and accurate assessment of stuttered speech. For this reason, there is a growing interest in the application of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technology to automate the dysfluency recognition. In this perspective, several studies have been carried out on the classification of dysfluencies by means of acoustic analysis, parametric and non-parametric feature extraction and statistical methods. This work is focused on introducing and evaluating Support Vector Machine (SVM) based dysfluency recognition system using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) supervector. The experimental evaluation of the proposed system reveals that an SVM-based GMM supervector is effective for dysfluency classification. We have obtained substantial improvements in the performance by considering cepstral and their delta features. Copyright © 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

Authors have mentioned that moment of resistance of beam can be determined by using the stress block parameters derived. This is ok from the point of view of limit state of collapse. However from the point of view of limit state of serviceability, especially for deflection check, information about modulus of elasticity, creep and shrinkage strain of SCC and the other concretes discussed is also necessary. Especially, the increase was very less in the case of 5% replacement. Still, specimen with 5% replacement registered a higher strain of 0.00192 than the specimen without rubber replacement.},

abstract={Kollamalayaali tribes of South India use latex of Maclura spinosa for milk curdling. This action is implicated to proteases which exhibit strong pharmacological potential in retardation of blood flow and acceleration of wound healing. Objective: To validate the presence of a proteolytic enzyme(s) in Maclura spinosa latex (MSL), and to investigate their probable role in hemostasis. Materials and Methods: Processed latex was examined for proteolytic and hemostatic activity using casein and human fibrinogen as substrates, respectively. Caseinoltyic activity was compared with two standard proteases viz., trypsin I and trypsin II. Effect of various standard protease inhibitors viz., iodoacetic acid (IAA), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid, and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid on both caseinolytic and fibrinogenolytic activities were examined. Electrophoretogram of fibrinogenolytic assays were subjected to densitometric analysis. Results: Proteolytic action of MSL was found to be highly efficient over trypsin I and trypsin II in dose-dependent caseinolytic activity (P < 0.05; specific activity of 1,080 units/mg protein). The A and Bbands of human fibrinogen were readily cleaved by MSL (for 1 ?g crude protein and 30 min of incubation time). Furthermore, MSL cleaved subunit in dose- And time-dependent manner. Quantitative correlation of these results was obtained by densitometric analysis. The caseinolytic activity of MSL was inhibited by IAA, PMSF. While, only PMSF inhibited fibrinogenolytic activity. Conclusions: MSL contains proteolytic enzymes belonging to two distinct superfamilies viz., serine protease and cysteine proteases. The fibrinogenolytic activity of MSL is restricted to serine proteases only. The study extrapolates the use of M. spinosa latex from milk curdling to hemostasis. © 2015 Pharmacognosy Magazine | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.},

Firstly, boundary probabilities are detected using the gradient magnitude based techniques such as - Canny edge detection (pbCanny), Second moment matrix (pb2MM), Multi-scale second moment matrix (pb2MM2), Gradient magnitude (pbGM) and Multi-scale gradient magnitude (pbGM2). Further, Ridgelets are applied to these boundaries to extract radial energy information exhibiting linear properties and PCA to reduce the dimensionality of these features. Finally, probabilistic neural network (PNN) classifiers are used to classify and observe the performance of gradient magnitude techniques in classification process.

abstract={Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is widely used technique in high data rate wireless communication system. The major drawback of the OFDM system is large Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR) which can overweigh all the potential benefit of the OFDM system. Due to high PAPR, the power amplifier lead to saturation and generates inter modulation among the subcarriers. In this paper, we propose iterative clipping and filtering technique along with convolutional code that clipped the amplitude of the OFDM signal, which reduces the PAPR without much degradation in the bit error rate (BER). The reduction in amplitude variation by clipping creates distortion in the OFDM signal. Due to this distortion at the receiver end result higher BER. This BER performance is further improved by using convolutional code. MATLAB coding result shows that sharp drop on Complementary Cumulative Distribution Function (CCDF) Curve and reduced the PAPR. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Objectives: Plant diseases extend a threat to the global production of herbal medicines. Safer plant protection strategies are in need to meet the demands from the pharmaceutical industry. Neem is a tree with great medicinal values, which is being infected by Phomopsis azadirachtae (PA), causing die back disease. The resulting massive destruction of the tree demands optimum disease management methods and thus, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the inhibitory potential of some plant extracts against the growth of PA. Methods: In this study, we investigate the in vitro antifungal activity of ether: chloroform (1:1), ethyl acetate, acetone and ethanol extracts from different parts (leaves and roots) of five plant species viz., Ocimum tenuiflorium, Centella asiatica, Solanum nigrum, Apium graveolens and Besella alba against the growth of PA. Results: All the 40 crude extracts (at concentration of 1000 μg/ml), were active against PA. Among them, the ethanol and ethyl acetate extracts proved optimum with antifungal activity ranging from 65-95% and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values from 75-200 μg/ml. The antifungal activity of the extracts was in the order: ethanol>ethyl acetate>acetone>ether: chloroform (1:1). Also, noteworthy results were observed in all the extracts tested against the spore germination of PA, with concentration and time-dependent kinetics. Conclusion: The results prove promising in order to develop new antifungal agents against the growth and spread of PA. © 2015, International Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Science.

The proposed concept exploits the statistical reliability through the CMME for approximation of music signals. In order to enhance the speed of the system, the CMME feature vectors of music database are indexed through Complex Multiscale Music Entropy Balanced (CMMEB) Kd tree leading to reduced search space and retrieval time. Eventually, CMME feature vectors are extracted from humming query for retrieval of the target song from music database. The experimental results effectually locate the humming queries and state the prominence of CMME and CMMEB Kd tree for retrieving the target song by humming.

abstract={Fluoride has beneficial as well as harmful effects on human beings. The combined electrochemical coagulation and fungal biosorption process is an effective treatment option as an alternative to the conventional defluoridation process. In the present study, batch electrochemical coagulation process in bipolar mode using four aluminum electrode was optimized as pre-treatment of combined electrochemical coagulation and biosorption process for defluoridation of groundwater. The batch electrochemical coagulation experiments were carried out by varying operational parameters such as: fluoride initial concentration (4-16mg/L), electrolysis time (10-60min), inter electrode spacing (5-10mm), cell voltage (6-12V) and agitation speed (300-500rpm) to optimize operational parameters for groundwater defluoridation. In addition, the experimental data of batch electrochemical coagulation was analyzed by the Stepwise Multiple Linear Regression analysis (SMLRA) to investigate the most significant operational parameter for the defluoridation of groundwater. The results reveal thatthe cell voltage and electrolysis time were the most significant operation parameters. The optimum operating parameters for the initial fluoride concentration of 16mg/L are: inter electrode spacing: 5mm, cell voltage: 12V, agitation speed: 500rpm with 91. 43% defluoridation efficiency. © 2015, International Journal of ChemTech Research.

abstract={Among the eco-friendly polymers, water soluble polymers are increasingly gaining importance to industry and academia, as they are easy to process, low cost, easily available, and more environmentally friendly than any other polymers. Water soluble polymers are widely used as stabilizers, thickeners, drug delivery materials, protective colloids, dispersants, flocculants, materials for oil recovery, etc. However, replacing nondegradable and nonrenewable plastic materials with these water soluble polymers for several applications remains as a big challenge. Several water soluble polymers, like those derived from naturally occurring proteins, polysaccharides, etc., and those obtained from synthetic methods are not having sufficient properties to replace the existing non-degradable plastic materials for most of the applications. Incorporation of nanomaterials into polymer matrices enhances the mechanical properties like tensile strength, modulus, stiffness, and impact strength significantly. Also other physical properties like barrier, optical, thermal resistance, nonflammability, etc., can also be improved by the introduction of nanomaterials. It is believed that the advances in polymer nanocomposite field will revolutionize the design, development, and performance of water soluble polymer-based materials, which ultimately have negligible adverse impact on the environment. Nanotechnology could be able to play an important role in solving this problem with the development of water soluble nanocomposite materials, which holds the key to future advances in the field of eco-friendly packaging systems. Several nanomaterials have been investigated for reinforcing water soluble polymers; however, rod-shaped cellulose nanocrystals (CNs) having high aspect ratios are found to be a promising nanomaterial for these types of applications. This chapter deals with the development and characterization of water soluble polymerbased nanocomposites containing cellulose nanocrystals and their applications. © Springer India 2015.},

abstract={Process Capability Indices (PCI) has been widely used as a means of summarizing process performance relative to set of specification limits. The proper use of process capability indices are based on some assumptions which may not be true always. Therefore, sometime whether the process capability indices can truly reflect the performance of a process is questionable. Most of PCIs, including Cp, Cpk, Cpm and Cpmk, neglect the changes in the shape of the distribution, which is an important indicator of problems in skewness-prone processes. Wright proposed a process capability index 'Cs' to detect shape changes in a process due to skewness by incorporating a penalty for skewness. In this paper, the effect of skewness on assessment of accuracy of Wright's capability index Cs is studied and comparison is made with Cp, Cpk, Cpm and Cpmk indices when the distribution of the quality characteristic (spring force) considered is skewed slightly. This paper also discusses how modelling the non normal data using statistical software and results were compared with other methods.},

abstract={Medical image segmentation is a fundamental preprocessing step in most systems that supports diagnosis or planning of surgical operations. The traditional Fuzzy c means clustering algorithm performs well in the absence of noise. Traditional FCM leads to its non robust result mainly due to 1. Not utilizing the spatial information in the image. 2. Use of Euclidean distance. These limitations can be addressed by using robust spatial kernel FCM (RSKFCM). RSKFCM consider the spatial information and uses Gaussian kernel function to calculate the distance between the center and data points. Though RSKFCM gives good result, the main drawback behind this method is the inability of generating global minima for the objective function. To improve the efficiency of RSKFCM method, in this paper we proposed the genetic algorithm based RSKFCM. By using the genetic algorithm, RSKFCM initializes the cluster centers and reaches the global minima of the objective function. Experimentation is carried out on the standard brain image dataset. Experimental result reveals that the proposed genetic algorithm based RSKFCM outperforms other FCM methods with the use of various cluster validity functions. © 2015 IEEE.},

The proposed representation method is very powerful in reducing the dimensionality of feature vectors for text classification. Further, the proposed method is used to form a symbolic representation (interval valued representation) for text documents. To corroborate the efficacy of the proposed model, we conducted extensive experimentation on standard text datasets. We have compared our classification accuracy achieved by the symbolic classifier with the other existing classifiers like: Naïve Bayes, k-NN, Centroid based and SVM classifiers. The experimental results reveal that the achieved classification accuracy is better than that of the existing methods.

The PF is a technique of searching in manifolds for problem solving through reduced search space. A new strategy for empirical mode decomposition (EMD) analysis is adopted, and outcomes are propelled as a significant source of information for multiresolution histogram (MRH) representations. Finally, the concept of PF is realized through MRH to retrieve the desired song by humming.

abstract={Phomopsis azadirachtae (PA), a deuteromycetous fungus, is responsible for die-back disease in neem. The conventional method of identification of the causative fungi has been based on morphological and microscopic studies which are inconclusive and laborious. To assist in a reliable and faster detection of the infection, molecular methods are widely used in various studies of characterizing different species of Phomopsis. Lack of adequate polymorphism at the ITS region in most Phomopsis spp. have led to identification of other gene sequences which assist in accurately resolving the species. The translation elongation factor 1-alpha (EF1-α) locus has assisted in accurate delineation of various fungal species as this is highly consistent and also exhibits sufficient polymorphism. In the present study, EF1-α sequences of 25 PA isolates were considered, along with some of the Phomopsis and Diaporthe spp. obtained using BLAST analyses. Subsequently, a pair of specific primers was designed to amplify a 240-bp product. The results illustrated that the primers were specific to all the PA isolates and could detect 50 ng/μl DNA template. To enhance the sensitivity of detection, a nested PCR protocol was designed which raised the detection limit to 10 fg/μl. In addition, the primers also proved efficient in detection of the pathogen in neem twigs obtained by artificial inoculation one day after infection, with the nested PCR method. The results provide a highly sensitive method in early and rapid detection of PA and facilitate in primary screening of the infection. © 2014, Koninklijke Nederlandse Planteziektenkundige Vereniging.},

abstract={Over past few years our group has been developing ARTSENS®, a low-cost, portable and non-invasive tool for measurement of arterial stiffness (AS). AS of the common carotid artery (CCA) has high prognostic value in stratification of risk of contracting cardiovascular disease (CVD) in future. ARTSENS uses a single element ultrasound transducer to obtain A-Mode frames from the CCA and processes them to obtain the diameter distension waveform. For calculation of AS, any AS measurement system requires the pulse pressure in the artery under investigation. In absence of reliable methods to estimate the carotid arterial pressure (CAP), in conventional AS measurement systems, the brachial arterial pressure (BAP) is used as a surrogate for the CAP to calculate the AS. This can lead to large errors, as there can be large difference in systolic pressures at both sites, especially in young subjects. In this paper we report an extension to the ARTSENS system to estimate the CAP from the BAP. This uses the fact that mean and diastolic pressures at both arterial sites are the same. We made the required hardware to obtain the systolic, mean and diastolic BAP. We then use the diameter distension waveform, obtained by processing ultrasound frames from ARTSENS, as a surrogate for the CAP waveform which is scaled and shifted to obtain the CCA pulse pressure (CPP). BAP and CAP were estimated for 10 human subjects using the new system. Bland-Altman analysis shows that ARTSENS is able to get BAP within acceptable limits of accuracy and pulse pressure is on an average 17 mmHg lower in CCA compared to the brachial artery which is in consonance with findings by other investigators. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: Postprandial hyperglycaemia in diabetes could be ameliorated by inhibiting intestinal α-glucosidases, responsible for starch hydrolysis and its absorption. Different parts of banana have been in use in conventional medicinal formulations since ancient times. Its role as an antihyperglycaemic agent has also been studied. This study was aimed at explaining the mechanism of hypoglycaemic effect by ethanol extract of banana pseudostem (EE). Additionally, studies on the active components involved in the effect have also been attempted. RESULTS: EE significantly inhibited mammalian intestinal α-glucosidases and yeast α-glucosidase (IC50, 8.11 ± 0.10 μg mL-1). The kinetic studies showed that EE inhibited sucrase, maltase and and p-nitrophenyl-α-d-glucopyranoside hydrolysis by mixed-type inhibition. Further, in vivo studies identified that the oral administration (100-200 mg kg-1 body weight) of EE significantly suppressed the maltose/glucose-induced postprandial plasma glucose elevation and wielded an antihyperglycaemic effect in normal and alloxan-induced diabetic rats. GC-MS analysis of EE revealed high levels of β-sitosterol (29.62%), stigmasterol (21.91%), campesterol (10.85%) and other compounds. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that EE might exert an anti-diabetic effect by inhibition of α-glucosidases from the intestine, in turn suppressing the carbohydrate absorption into the bloodstream. Hence the results extend a foundation to the future prospects of the food-derived enzyme inhibitors in treatment of diabetes. © 2014 Society of Chemical Industry.},

abstract={The main idea of this paper is to exploit our earlier work of image segmentation [11] and to propose a novel transform technique known as Coslets which is derived by applying 1D wavelet in DCT domain to categorize objects in large multiclass image datasets. Firstly, k-means clustering is applied to an image in complex hybrid color space and obtained multiple disjoint regions based on color homogeneity of pixels. Later, DCT brings out low frequency components expressing image’s visual features and further wavelets decomposes these coefficients into multi-resolution sub bands giving an advantage of spectral analysis to develop robust and geometrically invariant structural object visual features. A set of observed data (i.e. transformed coefficients) is mapped onto a lower dimensional feature space with a transformation matrix using PCA. Finally, different distance measure techniques are used for classification to obtain an average correctness rate for object categorization. We demonstrated our methodology of the proposed work on two very challenging datasets and obtained leading classification rates in comparison with several benchmarking techniques explored in literature. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={Ecological concern on accumulation of neutraceutical industrial waste material and the demands for newer composite materials have promoted extensive research on utilizing industrial wastes materials. Therefore, in the present study finely powdered ginger spent (GS), filled polyurethane (PU) green composites with varying amount viz., 0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 wt % of GS have been fabricated. The prepared PU/GS green composites have been characterized for their mechanical properties, density and void content. Interaction between filler and matrix has been confirmed from Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy studies. Moisture absorption and desorption studies have been performed at different relative humidity (RH). The moisture absorption and desorption studies, shows that as the hydrophilic GS content increases in the matrix the RH also increases. Water uptake behavior of PU/GS were measured in different chemical environments such as 5% sodium chloride solution, cold water at different temperature and in hydrochloric acid solution. The water uptake values increases as increase in GS concentration. Equilibrium water content, diffusivity and equilibrium time taken for all PU/GS composites have been investigated. Biodegradation studies reveals that as the GS content increases the weight loss also increases. Thermal properties have been performed using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). From DSC and DMA thermograms it is revealed that increase in Tg with increase in GS content. RH and contact angle measurement have been performed to understand the hydrophilic nature of the prepared composite. The morphological behavior of composites has been studied using scanning electron microscopy. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={In this paper, a simple and robust algorithm is proposed for iris segmentation. The proposed method consists of two steps. In first step, iris and pupil is segmented using Robust Spatial Kernel FCM (RSKFCM) algorithm. RSKFCM is based on traditional Fuzzy-c-Means (FCM) algorithm, which incorporates spatial information and uses kernel metric as distance measure. In second step, small eigenvalue transformation is applied to localize iris boundary. The transformation is based on statistical and geometrical properties of the small eigenvalue of the covariance matrix of a set of edge pixels. Extensive experimentations are carried out on standard benchmark iris dataset (viz. CASIA-IrisV4 and UBIRIS.v2). We compared our proposed method with existing iris segmentation methods. Our proposed method has the least time complexity of O(n(i +p)). The result of the experiments emphasizes that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing iris segmentation methods. © 2015 SPIE.},

abstract={Herbal extracts obtained from 20 Indian medicinal plants were evaluated for their cytoprotectivity on erythrocytes and antioxidant properties. Total phenol content and anti-rhizopus activity were also determined. Results indicated that, out of 20 extracts evaluated, radical scavenging capacity and anti-rhizopus activity were observed in aqueous extract of Ocimum tenuiflorum, Leucas aspera, Terminalia arjuna, Glycyrrhiza glabra and Nyctanthes arbortristis in a dose dependent manner. The total phenolic content was observed to be 1289, 3837, 372, 2831 and 1892 μg GAE/g for O. tenuiflorum, L. aspera, T. arjuna, G. glabra and N. arbortristis respectively. The antioxidant activity correlates with the phenolic content of the extracts. At 1 mg/ml the above extracts showed 98% protection on erythrocyte cell oxidation. These results demonstrate that the cytoprotectivity and antioxidant potency of these extracts could be the basis for their alleged health promoting potential. These herbs could serve as new sources of natural antioxidants or nutraceuticals with potential applications in reducing oxidative stress conditions. © 2015, International Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Science.

abstract={Objectives: The present study is centered on potential utilization of banana flower (FB) and pseudostem (PB), as a source of antimicrobial, cytotoxic and thrombolytic contributor, which otherwise is discarded as waste or burnt. Methods: FB and PB, the by-products of banana cultivation were extracted sequentially using various solvents viz., ether: chloroform (1:1), ethyl acetate, acetone, methanol, ethanol and water. In vitro antimicrobial activity of the extracts was tested against six bacterial strains using standard disc diffusion method and the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was performed by microdilution method. Further to validate the safe consumption, extracts were assessed for toxicity evaluation in cell culture against 3T3-L1 cell line (obtained from adipose tissues) using MTT assay. Also, the thrombolytic activity was performed by clot disruption method. Results: Phytochemical analysis demonstrated that FB and PB were a rich source of polyphenols (saponins, terpenoids, flavonoids, coumarins), cardiac glycosides and steroids. Extracts possessed antimicrobial activities against all the microorganisms tested, with MIC values in the range between 1.2 to 2.5 mg/ml. The investigation on thrombolytic activity by the aqueous extracts of FB (18%) and PB (13%) expressed a significant percentage of clot lysis with reference to Streptokinase (64%). Also, all the extracts of FB and PB exhibited no cytotoxic effect against 3T3L1 cell line. Conclusion: The present work demonstrates the antimicrobial, cytotoxic and thrombolytic activities of FB and PB extracts. The activities exhibited could be the basis for their alleged health promoting abilities and serve as new source of natural nutraceutical with potential applications. © 2015, International Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Science.

abstract={Impact of climate change on the water resources of the United States exposes the vulnerability of feedstock-specific mandated fuel targets to extreme weather conditions that could become more frequent and intensify in the future. Consequently, a sustainable biofuel policy should consider: (a) how climate change would alter both water supply and demand; and (b) in turn, how related changes in water availability will impact the production of biofuel crops; and (c) the environmental implications of large scale biofuel productions. Understanding the role of biofuels in the water cycle is the key to understanding many of the environmental impacts of biofuels. Therefore, the focus of this study is to model the rarely explored interactions between land use, climate change, water resources and the environment in future biofuel production systems. Results from this study will help explore the impacts of the US biofuel policy and climate change on water and agricultural resources. We used the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to analyze the water quantity and quality consequences of land use and land management related changes in cropping conditions (e.g., more use of marginal lands, greater residue harvest, increased yields), plus management practices due to biofuel crops to meet the Renewable Fuel Standard target on water quality and quantity. © 2015 by the authors.},

Scale-up of CWS for the rest of the city has been authorized and the initial stages of construction are currently in progress. We compared the historical consumption pattern in the CWS demonstration zone of Hubli with system capacity. We found that demand in the demonstration zone has stayed within system capacity and below the national standards for adequate supply. We developed two forecast models of bulk water demand under CWS and compared forecasts with planned future system capacity. In the case of full scale-up of CWS to the rest of Hubli-Dharwad, our forecasts indicate that planned system capacity may be insufficient to meet bulk demand. These forecast models can be adopted by similar mid-sized cities in India. © IWA Publishing 2015.},

abstract={Coagulation is an important physiological process in hemostasis which is activated by sequential action of proteases. This study aims to understand the involvement of aqueous fruit extract of Cucumis sativus L. (AqFEC) European burp less variety in blood coagulation cascade. AqFEC hydrolyzed casein in a dose-dependent manner. The presence of protease activity was further confirmed by casein zymography which revealed the possible presence of two high molecular weight protease(s). The proteolytic activity was inhibited only by phenyl methyl sulphonyl fluoride suggesting the presence of serine protease(s). In a dose-dependent manner, AqFEC also hydrolysed Aα and Bβ subunits of fibrinogen, whereas it failed to degrade the γ subunit of fibrinogen even at a concentration as high as 100 μg and incubation time up to 4 h. AqFEC reduced the clotting time of citrated plasma by 87.65 %. The protease and fibrinogenolytic activity of AqFEC suggests its possible role in stopping the bleeding and ensuing wound healing process. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Objective: Purification and biochemical characterization of LAAO from western region Indian Cobra (Naja naja) venom. Methods: LAAO was purified from Indian cobra (Naja naja) venom using sequential chromatography on Sephadex G-75 gel filtration followed by Ion exchange on CM-Sephadex C-25 column. Biochemical characterization viz., pH, Temperature, Km and Vmax were determined. Molecular weight of LAAO was determined by electrophoresis. Inhibition of LAAO from cold water extracts of Curcuma zedoria, Curcuma ceasia, Curcuma aromatic, Curcuma longa, Curcuma amada, Cucumis sativus and Benincasa hispida was done. Department of studies in Chemistry, University of Mysore, Manasagangothri, Mysore 570006, Karnataka, India Email: nanjuchem@gmail.com Results: Purified LAAO showed the single band on non reducing SDS-PAGE with approximate molecular weight of 65 kDa. Further biochemical characterization revealed that, LAAO from Naja naja (western region) has an optimum pH of 7.0 and is stable at room Temperature upto 37 °C and showed an optimum enzyme concentration of 4μg/ml and Km 134.1μM and Vmax is 21.87 U/min. Cold water extract of Curcuma ceasia, Curcuma aromatic and Benincasa hispida showed comparatively significant inhibition of LAAO. Conclusion: LAAO has promising therapeutic prospects because of its effects on various biological functions. Variation in snake species and their geographical distribution also contributes to the venom properties such as composition, toxicity level, pharmacological and biological activities. The significant difference in protein profiling leads to substantial lethality among different geographical regions. Thus in this study Indian Cobra (Naja naja) venom from the western region of India was subjected to purification of LAAO and biochemical characterization. © 2015, International Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Science.

abstract={Over centuries, plants are the richest resource of curative drugs as cited in folklore, traditional and modern medicinal systems and are been used as nutraceuticals, functional food supplements and in pharmaceuticals. Phytochemicals have exhibited beneficial effects against human acute and chronic ailments caused due to microbial pathogens. In recent years, phytochemicals and their derivatives have been extensively used as potent antimicrobials in humans and livestock due to their chemical stability, high bioavailability, low-molecular mass, safe consumption without any side-effect as seen in many antibiotic regimes. These phytocompounds have also been highlighted to function as Quorum Sensing Inhibitors (QSI) or antiquorumones in blocking bacterial pathogenesis preventing their regulatory mechanism and expression of specific set of virulence genes or cascades. However, the role of phytochemicals as QSI has been poorly identified but many of which remain unexplored. Therefore, this review summarizes most of the current scientific contributions focused on the use of plant phytochemicals as antiquorumones, highlighting the significance of plant derived molecules as bacterial inhibitors with larger emphasis on the mechanistic action of biofilm formation and quorum signaling networks mainly N-acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs), autoinducer-2 (AI-2) communications and their attributes in modulating the host immune response. A critical understanding of this complex trio-interaction between humans, microbes and phytochemicals has to be well explored, to exploit the usefulness of these metabolites ultimately paving newer paths for herbal drug discovery and their potential targets leading towards a better quality of life and human welfare. © 2015, International Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Science.

In this work genetic algorithm has been used to optimize the chassis cross section height, width and thickness by using their mathematical relationship with section modulus. The objective function is to optimize the section modulus based on bending moment equation. The optimization process is automated using C++language.

abstract={The aim of the present study was to formulate the hydrogels of hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) and acrylic acid (AA) with two drugs namely; disopyramide phosphate (DSP) and propafenone hydrochloride (PPH) for pH sensitive drug delivery systems. These monomers were polymerized by free radical polymerization method and crosslinked with ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA). The dynamic swelling and deswelling behaviors of the prepared hydrogels were studied by changing the pH from 1.2 to 7.4, varying copolymer compositions and crosslinker content. It was observed that with change in pH from 1.2 to 7.4, a considerable increase in swelling of about 70 % was observed for all formulations. It was also found that the degree of swelling increased with an increase in acrylic acid concentration and decreases with increase in EGDMA content. The drug loaded hydrogels were characterized by Fourier transmission infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The prepared drug loaded hydrogels have been further evaluated for drug content, in vitro drug release and stability studies. The in vitro drug release profiles of both the drugs were almost similar indicating that release is independent of the drug used and also the formulations showed stability for about 30 days.},

abstract={Helicobacter pylori (HP) emergences in gastro intestinal tracts of human beings are one of the major health concerns in recent times. The infection in the later stages can lead to peptic ulcers and gastric cancers. HP is second commonly encountered pathogen in humans next only to Streptococcus. The virulence of the pathogen is further strengthened by its capability in forming biofilms. There are various therapies to treat this infection which are classified as first line, second line and third line, but are not free from the serious antibiotic resistances which normally are encountered in treating bacterial diseases. Vowing to above reason, it is necessary to search for alternative management strategies with lesser side effects and complications like plant based drugs and designer nutraceutical products which includes herbal extracts, probiotics, phytomedicines, antioxidants, essential oils, flavonoids so-on. In the present study, we have reviewed on the thorough understanding on biology, complications and management of H. Pylori and its infections. © 2015, International Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Science. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Objective: Andrographis paniculata (A. paniculata) Nees is an important medicinal plant found in the tropical regions and has been traditionally used in Indian and Chinese medicinal systems. A. paniculata is found to exhibit anti-snake venom properties; however its inhibitory potential on multi-toxic Phospholipases A2 and its associated inflammatory reactions is not clearly understood. Henceforth, in this study we evaluate the inhibitory/neutralizing potential of alcoholic extract of A. paniculata on the isolated multi-toxic PLA2 (of Daboii rusellii pulchella and Naja naja) and its induced edema in Swiss albino mice. Methods: The multi-toxic-svPLA2-VRV-PL-V from the venom of Daboii rusellii pulchella was purified according established methods. The inhibition of enzymatic activity and edema inducing activity was carried out according to established methods. Results: A. paniculata extract dose dependently inhibited the multi-toxic svPLA2 enzymatic activity with an IC50 value of 12.4±0.6 μg/ml. Further, the extract dose dependently inhibited the edema formation, when co-injected with the enzyme indicating a strong correlation between lipolytic activity and pro-inflammatory activity. Conclusion: The ethanolic extract of A. paniculata effectively inhibited the multi-toxic svPLA2 and its associated edema inducing activities, which substantiate their anti-ophidian properties. Further study is interesting to develop them into potent anti-ophidian agents. © 2015, International Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Science. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) is known to regulate inflammation and hence it is considered as a validated drug-target by medicinal chemists. In this report, we have identified and considered a highly ranked ligand from the ZINC-drug-like compounds database that targets PLA2 via the MOLPRINT-2D based chemoinformatics drug-design approach. The computationally predicted lead molecule was found to contain a core moiety of a chromene ring, which is well known for its varied biological properties. Here, a novel and efficient retro-synthetic protocol for the synthesis of highly substituted chromene libraries was made. A one-pot synthesis of chromene was carried out using different aromatic primary alcohols, malononitrile and 4-hydroxy coumarin in the presence of a mild oxidant mixture called T3P®-DMSO, followed by a Suzuki coupling reaction to obtain the lead molecules. All of the tested compounds of the chromene series displayed inhibition of the venom PLA2 in the range of 12 to 68 μM. Among the tested compounds, 2-amino-4-(2′-methyl-[1,1′-biphenyl]-4-yl)-5-oxo-4,5-dihydropyrano[3,2-c]chromene-3-carbonitrile (7b) showed maximum inhibitory efficacy against venom PLA2 with an IC50 value of 12.5 μM. Furthermore, the designed PLA2 ligands bound to the active site of venom PLA2, whose binding affinity was comparable to nimesulide, indicating that the chromene moiety containing ligands could be novel lead-structures that serve as anti-inflammatory agents. © 2015 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={Menisci of the knee joint play an important role in cushioning and load bearing capabilities of the joint. In osteoarthritis (OA) affected knee joints cartilage and menisci are degenerated. The dislocation and tears of menisci are common during sports and other accidental injuries. Diagnostic arthroscopy is an invasive procedure to visualize knee joint menisci with a possible risk of infection after the procedure. The complete meniscectomy or partial meniscectomy are the invasive procedures performed on the knee joint to diagnose and repair the menisci. Meniscectomy procedures conducted on such patients may result in further damage to the cartilage and its load distribution. Proper evaluation of the meniscal size, volume and attachments is essential before meniscectomy and meniscal transplant surgeries. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) being a non invasive procedure is adequately suited for the diagnosis of menisci pathologies. Direct volume rendering of knee joint from MRI increases the number of voxels processed. Segmentation of menisci from knee MRI and then volume of interest (VOI) processing for 3D volume rendering reduces the complexity. The objective of this study was to segment the menisci from knee joint MRI using seeded region growing (SRG) algorithm and volume rendering for 3D visualization. The length and width of menisci are quantified and the results are compared with the results obtained from radiologist assessments (manual) as reference. The volume of menisci are quantified and compared with measurements obtained using commercial software (MIMICS) as reference. The agreement between the two methods of menisci quantification was assessed using Bland -Altman method. The results are found to be accurate and are of diagnostic and therapeutic importance.

abstract={In this paper, we present a grid structured morphological pattern spectrum based approach for off-line signature verification. The proposed approach has three major phases: preprocessing, feature extraction and verification. In the feature extraction phase, the signature image is partitioned into eight equally sized vertical grids and grid structured morphological pattern spectra for each grid is obtained. The grid structured morphological spectrum is represented in the form of 10-bin histogram and normalised to overcome the problem of scaling. The eighty dimensional feature vector is obtained by concatenating all the eight vertical morphological spectrum based normalised histogram. For verification purpose, we have considered two well known classifiers, namely SVM and MLP and conducted experiments on standard signature datasets namely CEDAR, GPDS-160 and MUKOS, a regional language (Kannada) dataset. The comparative study is also provided with the well known approaches to exhibit the performance of the proposed approach. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={The Upper Trinity River Basin (TRB) is the most populated river basin and one of the largest water suppliers in Texas. However, sediment and nutrient loads are reducing the capacity of reservoirs and degrading water quality. The objectives of this study are to calibrate and validate the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model for ten study watersheds within the Upper TRB in order to assess nutrient loads into major reservoirs in the basin and to predict the effects of point source elimination and urbanization on nutrient loads through scenario analyses. SWAT performed reasonably well for the current condition except for two out of five tributaries in the Eagle Mountain watershed and total phosphorous in Richland-Chambers. The impacts of simulated scenarios varied within watersheds. Point-source elimination achieved reductions ranging from 0.3% to 24% in total phosphorus and 1% to 56% in total nitrogen received by the reservoirs. Population and development projections were used to examine the impacts of urbanization on each watershed. Projected urbanization in 2030 had large effects on simulated total phosphorus loads in some watersheds, ranging from a reduction of 1% to an increase of 111%. Projected urbanization also affected simulated total nitrogen loads, from a reduction of 3% to an increase of 24%. One limitation of this study is the lack of long-term, up-to-date water quality data due to discontinued water-quality monitoring stations. Although careful considerations were given to the adjustment of parameter values reflecting various aspects of the nutrient processes, further data collection will enhance modeling study for assessment of these watersheds' water resources and environmental problem. © 2015 by the authors.},

abstract={Postprandial hyperglycaemia is characterized as the earliest symptom of diabetes and its management attenuates several of the associated secondary complications. In this context, we investigated the role of ethanol extract of banana flower (EF) for its antihyperglycaemic effects. The EF showed a strong inhibition towards α-glucosidase and pancreatic amylase which play a vital role in clinical management of postprandial hyperglycaemia. The major active compounds present in EF were identified as Umbelliferone (C1) and Lupeol (C2) using various spectroscopic methods. C1 (IC50: 7.08±0.17μg/ml) and C2 (IC50: 7.18±0.14μg/ml) were found to inhibit α-glucosidase in a non-competitive mode of inhibition, with low Ki values. Further, in vitro glycation assays showed that EF and its compounds prevented each stage of protein glycation and formation of its intermediary compounds. EF, C1 and C2 also exhibited a potent inhibition on aldose reductase with IC50 values of 2.25±0.29, 1.32±0.22 &amp; 1.53±0.29μg/ml respectively. Our results suggest that, the observed potential of EF in antihyperglycaemic activity via inhibition of α-glucosidase and in antidiabetogenic effect by inhibition of polyol pathway and protein glycation is more likely to be attributed to the presence of C1 and C2. © 2014 South African Association of Botanists.},

abstract={Secretory phospholipases A2 (sPLA2s) are present in snake venoms, serum, and biological fluids of patients with various inflammatory, autoimmune and allergic disorders. Lipid mediators in the inflammatory processes have potential value for controlling phospholipid metabolism through sPLA2 inhibition. Thus, it demands the need for screening of potential leads for sPLA2 inhibition. To date, sPLA 2 activity has been assayed using expensive radioactive or chromogenic substrates, thereby limiting a large number of assays. In this study, a simple and sensitive NanoDrop assay was developed using non-fluorogenic and non-chromogenic phospholipid substrate 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3- phosphocholine (DMPC) and 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid (ANS) as interfacial hydrophobic probe. The modified assay required a 10ng concentration of sPLA2. ANS, as a strong anion, binds predominantly to cationic group of choline head of DMPC through ion pair formation, imparting hydrophobicity and lipophilicity and resulting in an increase in fluorescence. Triton X-100 imparts correct geometrical space during sPLA2 catalyzing DMPC, releasing lysophospholipid and acidic myristoyl acid, which in turn alters the hydrophobic environment prevailing around ANS-DMPC, which leads to weakening of the electrostatic ion pair interaction between DMPC and ANS ensuing decrease in fluorescence. These characteristic fluorescence changes between DMPC and ANS in response to sPLA2 catalysis are well documented and validated in this study. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The test revealed that the newly synthesized compounds had potent inhibition towards both 5-LOX and AChE in lower micro molar concentration. Among the tested compounds, the most active compound, 2-[(2-acetyl-6,6-dimethyl-4-phenyl-5,6-dihydro-2H-1,2-oxazin-3- yl)methyl]-1H-isoindole-1,3(2H)-dione (2a) showed inhibitory activity towards 5-LOX and AChE with an IC50 values of 1.88, and 2.5 μM, respectively. Further, the in silico molecular docking studies revealed that the compound 2a bound to the catalytic domain of AChE strongly with a highest CDOCKER score of -1.18 kcal/mol when compared to other compounds of the same series. Additionally, 2a showed a good lipophilicity (log P = 2.66), suggesting a potential ability to penetrate the blood-brain-barrier. These initial pharmacological data revealed that the compound 2a could serve as a drug-seed in developing anti-Alzheimer's agents. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) based hybrid nanocomposites reinforced with bacterial cellulose nanocrystals (BCNC) and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) had been prepared and characterised. BCNC was capable of improving the tensile strength and modulus of HPMC, but they made the film more brittle. The addition of AgNPs along with BCNC, helped to regain some of the lost elongation properties without affecting other properties. Moisture sorption analysis proved that the hydrophilicity of the nanocomposite decreased considerably by the addition of these nanomaterials. Several mathematical models were also used to fit the experimental sorption results. A unique combination of two nanomaterials was highly effective in overcoming certain limitations of nanocomposites which uses only one type of nanomaterial. This type of hybrid nanocomposites with superior properties is expected to be useful in eco-friendly food packaging applications. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={System with multiple virtual machines creates IO Challenges for storage vendors. As the number of virtual machines per system increases, simultaneous IO requests coming from different virtual machines create storage resource contention. This contention degrades storage system performance which in turn impacts overall performance of the entire virtual infrastructure. To overcome, Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) will need different mechanism for routing IO Requests to maximize the storage system performance in virtual infrastructure. In this paper, we present Virtual Disk IO Scheduler (vDIOS) for re-ordering of IO requests at VMM level. It will increase number of input and output operations per second (IOPS) of an existing storage system up to 3X. The vDIOS re-orders I/O requests in such a way as to minimize the rotational latencies and seek times for each IO request. In Experiment, we analyze the Random IO operations, and shown that the proposed approach greatly increases the through put of existing storage system. © 2014 IEEE.},

The effects of CCO content viz., 5, 10, 20, and 30 wt% on the physico-mechanical properties and chemical structure of PUs have been evaluated. The mechanical properties of the PUs indicate that the incorporation of CCO improves the tensile behaviors. The swelling behaviors of the PUs have been studied in organic solvents. The microcrystalline parameters, such as crystal size (<N>) and lattice disorder (g), of PUs have been estimated using wide-angle X-ray scattering studies. The results of tensile behaviors were corroborated with the microcrystalline parameters of the PUs. For a holistic view of the parameters involved in these systems, we have carried out the multivarient analysis that gives a better perspective of the result. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={This paper presents a segment-based probabilistic approach to robustly recognize continuous sign language sentences. The recognition strategy is based on a two-layer conditional random field (CRF) model, where the lower layer processes the component channels and provides outputs to the upper layer for sign recognition. The continuously signed sentences are first segmented, and the sub-segments are labeled SIGN or ME (movement epenthesis) by a Bayesian network (BN) which fuses the outputs of independent CRF and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. The sub-segments labeled as ME are discarded and the remaining SIGN sub-segments are merged and recognized by the two-layer CRF classifier; for this we have proposed a new algorithm based on the semi-Markov CRF decoding scheme. With eight signers, we obtained a recall rate of 95.7% and a precision of 96.6% for unseen samples from seen signers, and a recall rate of 86.6% and a precision of 89.9% for unseen signers. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={This study presents isothermal crystallization kinetics of Polyamide 6/Liquid Natural Rubber (PA6/LNR) blends of different compositions, at different crystallization temperatures using the DSC technique at high under cooling (ΔT > 80 C). The results showed that the degree of crystallinity of PA6/LNR blend is less than that of PA6. Neat PA6 exhibits a single melting peak while blends exhibit an additional diffused peak at lower temperatures. The PA6/LNR blends showed relatively lower half crystallization time than PA6. The isothermal crystallization kinetics of PA6 and blends has been described by the Avrami equation and Sestak Berggren equation. The Avrami exponent, n for PA6 is in the range of 2-3 and that of blends is in the range of 1-2, at high under cooling conditions. In general, with the addition of LNR, the shape of the nuclei tends to change from spherical to plate/disk geometry. The equilibrium melting temperatures of the blends was evaluated based on Hoffman-Weeks theory. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Sacrificial electrode (Aluminium) dissolutions controlled by the cell voltage was found as key factor. Electrocoagulation is used as a pretreatment which is then followed by sequential batch reactor. Electrochemical coagulation is conducted in wide range of voltages from 5 to 40 volts to find optimum voltage for a time period of 60 minutes. Samples were collected at a time interval of 15 minutes each and were analyzed. Efficiency obtained were ~97% for removal of color, ~60% of solids and ~64% for removal of organic matter in electrochemical coagulation. After electrochemical coagulation wastewater is passed to sequential batch reactor for further treatment. Sequential batch reactor is a biological treatment process, where wastewater was treated in a batch by adding cow dung slurry as seeding innoculum. Whole process is divided into five phases with total time period of eight hours. Overall efficiency obtained after both the processes was ~93% in the removal of color, ~62% removal in solids and ~84% in removal of organic matter.},

abstract={Many applications in scientific computations exhibit both data and task parallelism. Several studies have proved that designing parallel applications using both task and data parallelism is an effective approach than pure data or pure task parallel models. This mixed parallelism achieves both higher scalability and performance. Mixed parallel applications are represented as Parallel Task Graph (PTG), a graph of data parallel tasks. Scheduling such a mixed-parallel application is NP-complete even on a single homogeneous cluster. To maximize resource utilizations and to increase cluster throughput, multiple applications are scheduled concurrently on a cluster. Scheduling multiple applications is challenging as different applications compete for the shared resources and also fairness must be ensured. A new method to perform concurrent schedule of multiple PTGs on a cluster is proposed in this work. Further a complete framework to schedule PTGs submitted at different instants of time and to vary processor allotment for each application during their depending on processor availability is proposed. From simulation experiments, it is observed that the proposed method to schedule multiple PTGs performs better than other methods found in the literature. The suggested scheduler framework to handle online submission of PTGs is proved to be a promising one. © 2014 IEEE.},

The dielectric constant (ε′), dielectric loss (ε″), AC conductivity (σac), dielectric loss tangent (tan δ), and electric modulus (M′ and M″) of the nanocomposite films were measured over a range of frequencies at ambient temperature. The results show increases in σac and M′ with frequency, whereas ε′, ε″, and tan δ decreased with increasing frequency. The films were also characterized using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques.

The objective of this system is to find how effectively it recognizes characters that are stored as patterns in the system and map the input to the stored pattern, when the input patterns are diversified. And in order to achieve this, the idea of Bidirectional Associative Memory is used. Bidirectional Associative Memory is a two level non linear neural network. One important performance attribute of discrete BAM is the ability to recall the stored pairs particularly in the presence of noise.

But the temperature setting depends on the weather and also on the personal preferences of the user. Whatever be the condition, the user would always prefer to adjust the temperature in such a way that would make him feel comfortable. This sense of comfort can be captured using the thermal sensor, that records the user's body temperature say 10 minutes after the user has set the temperature of the conditioner and the next time all that the user has to do is, just switch on the air conditioner and the sensor adjusts the room temperature according to the user's body temperature. With this technique, the user is given the liberty of setting the temperature once i,e setting his sense of comfort just once and avoid the trouble of using the remote controller every time to set the temperature. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={A process which ensures person authentication information by processing unique feature vectors, which were fetched from human inimitable characteristics, is known as unimodal biometric system (UBS). Though these systems provide a very good result, they fail in certain conditions such as noisy acquisition, missing out of unique human characteristics etc. There is need for robust biometric system. Current smart electronic devices capture and process enormous amount of data and execute results in less time. This paper presents past research and development in the field of biometric technology. It also describes major technological perspective and fundamental progress in unimodal and multimodal biometric system. Also, it reviews the modalities of biometric system, biometric classification methods, past experimental results, merits and demerits of unimodal system. It describes the integration scenario of multimodal biometrics. The objective of this review paper is to summarize past and current trends, and it conclude with the decision on future direction for developing proficiency in the field of person authentication biometric technology. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={The Optical Braille Character Recognition (OBR) system is in significant need in order to preserve the Braille documents to make them available in future for the large section of visually impaired people and also to make the bi-directional communication between the sighted people and the visually impaired people feasible. The recognition and transcribing the double sided Braille document into its corresponding natural text is a challenging task. This difficulty is due to the overlapping of the front side dots (Recto) with that of the back side dots (Verso) in the Inter-point Braille document. In such cases, the usual method of template matching to distinguish recto and verso dots is not efficient. In this paper a new system for double sided Braille dot recognition is proposed, which employs a two-stage highly efficient and an adaptive technique to differentiate the recto and verso dots from an inter-point Braille using the projection profile method. In this paper we present (i) a horizontal projection profile for Braille line segmentation, (ii) vertical projection profile for Braille word segmentation and (iii) Integration of horizontal and vertical projection profiles along with distance thresholding for Braille character segmentation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this segmentation technique on a large dataset consisting of 754 words from Hindi Devanagari Braille documents with varying image resolution and with different word patterns. A recognition rate of 96.9% has been achieved. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Human computer interaction (HCI) is very crucial in our day-to-day activity. Speech is one of the essential and intuitive ways to interact with machines such as Smartphone, which has multiple sensors as microphone, camera, etc. An efficient performance speech recognition system improves interaction between man and machines by making latter more receptive to user needs. Such system has Automatic speech recognition (ASR) engine, which is facing a unique challenge of accuracy in recognition rate. By integrating acoustic signal feature vectors with the visual features, a more robust audiovisual speech recognition engine (AVSR) could be developed for real environmental scenarios. This paper presents past research and development in the field of ASR and AVSR technologies. It describes key technological perspective and admiration of the fundamental progress in ASR and AVSR.

The LNR is prepared by mastication of pale latex crepe in the presence of 0.5 phr Peptizol 7. The PA6/LNR blend samples are characterized in terms melt flow index, hardness, abrasion resistance, impact strength, flexural strength, tensile strength, and thermal properties. The impact strength of PA6 increases by about 67% upon addition of 10% LNR. The percolation model is applied to study of brittle to ductile transition. The percolation threshold for the brittle to ductile transition of the blend was found to be 14.5 wt % LNR, corresponding to the critical volume fraction of the stress volume, Vsc = 0.58, which is consistent with the calculated value of ≈ π/6. The PA6/LNR blends exhibit cavitation and matrix shear yielding, which would be the main contribution to the increases impact strength. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Further, local binary fitting energy is introduced to obtain local image intensity information. In addition to that variational level set function is integrated to detect an accurate boundary of the texts present in images/video frames. The proposed method is able to detect a region of text with high complexity as well low intensity texts and also detects a text region in varying background.

abstract={Wireless sensor networks essentially consist of an amalgam of autonomous sensor nodes deployed in an ad-hoc manner to collect information about the surroundings. These sensor nodes usually dispense the collected information to data sink nodes through information routing techniques. Predictive Node Expiration Based Energy - aware Source Routing (PNEB ESR) protocol is an energy aware routing protocol which attempts to optimize the overall energy efficiency of the sensor network and ensures the sensed information reaches a data sink through a reliable path. In this protocol, the Energy Depletion Rate of a node is calculated at predetermined energy levels and is used to predict when a node will outlive its usefulness. This is used in the prediction of route expirations which will provide timely insights to the nodes on when to seek for alternative routes to data sinks. Simulations show that the PNEB ESR protocol is successful in making reliable route selections and theoretically minimizes the number of control packets flowing in the network. This leads to considerable reduction in processing and communication costs and hence minimizes overall energy consumption. Copyright 2014 ACM.},

abstract={A Braille document image is a collection of dots. The position of the dot and relative-ness of the dot with other dots gives different Braille characters. It is challenging, to separate the character lines, words and characters from a Braille document. This paper presents an Optical Braille character recognition system for both machine punched and hand punched Kannada Braille text documents [21]. Standard spacing between the characters and lines are used to segregate the dots. Dot mesh is created and character box is identified. Once character box is identified an efficient look up method is designed to identify the equivalent normal Kannada character. A unique value for the Braille character is generated and the Braille character is matched to the corresponding normal Kannada character in one shot. A Braille character is made of 6 dots combination and hence only 26=64 different combinations are possible. Recognized character is classified into one of the 64 possible classes. Identifying the dot position inside a character box is done using the dot mesh and by computing the centre position of all the objects inside the character box. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Face recognition for establishment of unique identification of an individual confronts many hurdles in the form of occlusions, variations in intensity across the face, damage to the facial features during accidents, etc. It becomes a prime necessity to reconstruct the facial features to extract the correct identity. Image inpainting is an imminent and fascinating area of research predominantly used for reconstructing the obscured precincts of an image or for intelligently adding up of a new component into the image. Proficient algorithms have been put forth for the successful accomplishment of the task of image inpainting. The efficiency is well pronounced if the regions to be reconstructed are well within the boundary regions of the objects to be reconstructed. The bottleneck arises when the enclosure to be reconstructed falls on the boundary, wherein it becomes very intricate for the image inpainting algorithms to perform efficiently, mainly due to the reason that the bounds for the object are not known definitely. Such circumstances give rise to smudged image bounds which are not acceptable and also not admissible, thereby resulting in ineffectual object (face) recognition. Through this paper, a humble effort has been put forth to set the boundary and to trim down the complexities involved while inpainting under acute conditions using the affirmative features provided by nonlinear curve-fitting techniques. © 2014 Springer India.},

abstract={Since Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) captures complex densities of the data and has become one of the most significant methods for clustering in unsupervised context; we study and explore the idea of mixture models for image categorization. In this regard, we first segment all image categories in hybrid color space (HCbCr - LUV) to identify the color homogeneity between the neighboring pixels and then k-means technique is applied for partitioning image pixels into its coordinated clusters. Further, transformation matrix for each of the clusters is obtained by applying subspace methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) & Fisher's Linear Discriminant (FLD) to all segmented classes. These clusters are viewed as mixture of several Gaussian classes (latent variables) and Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is applied to these Gaussian mixtures giving best maximum likelihood estimators and thereby obtaining highly discriminative features in reduced feature space. For subsequent classification, we use diverse Distance Measures (DM) and Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN). The results obtained is evident that the proposed model exhibits highly discriminative image representation that leads to the improved classification rates to the state-of-the-art on standard benchmark datasets such as Caltech-101 & Caltech-256. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={The off-line signature verification approach based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  and Muti-Layer Perceptrons (MLP)  is proposed in this work. The proposed approach involves three major phases. In the first phase, the signature image is subjected to preprocessing, such as binarization, noise elimination, skew correction followed by normalising the image by a series of thinning and dilating with a structuring element of size 3X3. The principal component analysis is employed on the preprocessed signature samples and the features extracted are termed as eigen-sign feature vectors, in second phase. The multilayer perceptrons, a neural network based approach is trained with eigen-sign feature vector and subsequently  used for verification of signature samples. Extensive experimentation has been conducted on the publicly available signature datasets namely, CEDAR, GPDS-100 and MUKOS, a regional language dataset. The state-of-art off-line signature verification  methods are considered for comparative study and objective analysis through experimental results is provided to justify the accuracy of the proposed approach. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

abstract={This paper proposes a method of indexing handwritten characters of a large number of classes by the use of Kd-tree. The Ridgelets and Gabor features are used for the purpose of representation. A multi dimensional feature vectors are further projected to a lower dimensional feature space using PCA. The reduced dimensional feature vectors are used to index the character database by Kd-tree. In a large class OCR system, the aim is to identify a character from a large class of characters. Interest behind this work is to have a quick reference to only those potential characters which can have a best match for given unknown character to be recognized without requiring scanning of the entire database. The proposed method can be used as a supplementary tool to speed up the task of identification. The proposed method is tested on handwritten Kannada character database consisting of 2000 images of 200 classes. Experimental results show that the approach yields a good Correct Index Power (CIP) and also depicts the effectiveness of the indexing approach. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014, All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={In texture-based text detection method, text regions are detected by obtaining textural properties of an image. In order to obtain textural properties of an input image, the proposed system performs single-level 2D DWT. The resultant detail coefficients are averaged to get a better texture properties and to localize for further processing. Then, 2D DWT is explored with a level set method to address the problem of text detection especially curving portions of text present in images and video frames. Thus, the proposed system implements the level set method to detect the true text regions effectively based on contours in images and video frames. Experimental results prove that the proposed level set based method is competitive when compared with other existing methods in reducing false positive rate and mis detection rate. Hence, the proposed system is encouraging and useful to carry out further research on text extraction in images and video. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014},

abstract={In this paper, we propose to explore the possibility of integrating the appearance based paradigm with frequency domain for off-line signature verification. The proposed approach has four major phases : Preprocessing, Feature extraction, Feature reduction and Classification. In the feature extraction phase, Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is employed on the signature image to obtain the upper-left corner block of size m × n as a representative feature vector. These features are subjected to Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), thus reducing the feature vector to represent the signature with optimal set of features. The merits of DCT that captures the significant information in a small pack of coefficients is fed into discriminant analysis for further compact representation. The proposed approach, DiscriminativeDCT - MLP combines the benefits of two domains, yet does not suffer from their individual limitations. The optimal representative features from all the samples in the dataset form the knowledge base. Further, the Multi-layer perceptrons (MLP), a well known classifier is used for classification and the performance is measured through FAR/FRR metrics. Experiments have been conducted on standard signature datasets namely: CEDAR and GPDS-160, and MUKOS, a regional language (Kannada) dataset. The comparative study is also provided with the well known approaches to exhibit the performance of the proposed approach. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a new method of representing text documents based on clustering of term frequency vectors. Term frequency vectors of each cluster are used to form a symbolic representation (interval valued representation) by the use of mean and standard deviation. In order to cluster the term frequency vectors, we make use of fuzzy C-Means clustering method for interval type data based on adaptive squared Euclidean distance between vectors of intervals. Further, to corroborate the efficacy of the proposed model we conducted extensive experimentation on standard datasets like 20 Newsgroup Large, 20 Mini Newsgroup, Vehicles Wikipedia and our own created datasets like Google Newsgroup and Research Article Abstracts. We have compared our classification accuracy achieved by the Symbolic classifier with the other existing Naïve Bayes classifier, KNN classifier, Centroid based classifier and SVM classifiers. The experimental results reveal that the achieved classification accuracy is better than that of the existing methods. In addition, our method is based on a simple matching scheme; it requires negligible time for classification. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

In this paper, color uniformity is considered as a significant criterion for partioning the image into considerable multiple disjoint regions and the distribution of the pixel intensities are investigated in different color spaces. A study of single component and hybrid color components is performed. As a result, it is noticed that different color spaces can be created and the performance of an image segmentation procedure is known to be very much dependent on the choice of the color space. In this study, a novel complex hybrid color space HCbCr is derived from the basic primary color spaces and then transformed it into LUV color space. Further, an unsupervised k-means clustering has been applied which significantly describes the relationship between the color space and the impact on color image segmentation.We experiment our proposed color space image segmentation model with the standard human segmented images of Berkeley dataset, results proved to be very promising compared to conventional and existing color space models. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

abstract={With the advent of large scale computing environment, there is a need for scheduling methods which allow multiple DAG-structured applications to share the cluster resources with the objectives of increasing the throughput and maximizing the resource utilization. The number of processors allotted to each application is decided during runtime, depending on the number and nature of applications being scheduled together. The static schedule generated is fixed for a specified number of processors and also the quality of schedule is handicapped by the estimated execution time of tasks in the application. Since the number of processors allotted for each DAG is not known a priori in a multiple DAG scheduling environment, instead of a static schedule, a dynamic scheduler which relies on actual execution time of tasks is better. But its performance is limited as the only information it has is the number of tasks scheduled on each processor. The knowledge of an application in terms of its structure, estimated execution time of tasks and relative importance of tasks, can be used by a dynamic scheduler for better scheduling of tasks resulting in decreased application execution time. With the use of a priori application information, different scheduling policies for a hybrid scheduler are proposed and their performance is compared with the scheduler found in literature. The results obtained demonstrate the suitability of the proposed hybrid scheduler in multiple DAGs scheduling environment. © 2014 IEEE.},

The fabricated polyurethane/ginger spent green composites have been performed for mechanical properties such as surface hardness and tensile behaviours. The swelling behavior of the composites has been studied in different organic solvents. Improvement in tensile behaviors of the polyurethane/ginger spent composites were noticed up to 7.5wt% of ginger spent content. Thermogravimetric analysis of the green composites has been carried out in order to determine the thermal stability and their mode of thermal degradation behaviour. The thermogravimetric analysis curves of polyurethane/ginger spent composites indicated three-step thermal degradation processes, suffers no weight loss up to 193? and completely degrades at around 540?. Thermal degradation kinetic parameters such as energy of activation (Ea) have been calculated for the green composites using two mathematical models namely Coats-Redfern and Broido's models. The microcrystalline parameters such as crystal size (<N>) and lattice strain have been computed using wide-angle X-ray scattering data. The structure-property relationship of the polyurethane/ginger spent composites has been established on the basis of these parameters. © The Author(s) 2013 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.},

The GPCs can be self curing, with compressive strengths ranging from 20 to 75 MPa. Data on GPCs with reference to stress-strain curves, bond strengths, corrosion and sulphate resistances, thermal conductivity and expansion coefficients, electrical and acid resistances, ultrasonic pulse velocity, flexural and shear behaviour etc. indicate that the GPCs can be designed to possess satisfactory structural and durability performances related characteristics with low carbon footprint.},

abstract={Classification of text documents is one of the most common themes in the field of machine learning. Although a text document expresses a wide range of information, but it lacks the imposed structure of tradition database. Thus, unstructured data, particularly free running text data has to be transferred into a structured data. Hence, in this paper we represent the text document unconventionally by making use of symbolic data analysis concepts. We propose a new method of representing documents based on clustering of term frequency vectors. Term frequency vectors of each cluster are used to form a symbolic representation by the use of Mean and Standard Deviation. Further, term frequency vectors are used in the form a interval valued features. To cluster the term frequency vectors, we make use of Single Linkage, Complete Linkage, Average Linkage, K-Means and Fuzzy C-Means clustering algorithms. To corroborate the efficacy of the proposed model we conducted extensive experimentations on standard datasets like 20 Newsgroup Large, 20 Mini Newsgroup, Vehicles Wikipedia datasets and our own created datasets like Google Newsgroup and Research Article Abstracts. Experimental results reveal that the proposed model gives better results when compared to the state of the art techniques. In addition, as the method is based on a simple matching scheme, it requires a negligible time. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Objectives Lipoxygenases (LOX) are the key enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of leukotrienes and reactive oxygen species, which are implicated in pathophysiology of inflammatory disorders. This study was conducted to evaluate the inhibitory effect of water-soluble antioxidant ascorbic acid and its lipophilic derivative, ascorbic acid 6-palmitate (Vcpal) on polymorphonuclear lymphocyte 5-LOX and soybean 15-LOX (sLOX) in vitro. Methods LOX activity was determined by measuring the end products, 5-hydroperoxy eicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE) and lipid hydroperoxides, by spectrophotometric and high performance liquid chromatography methods. The substrate-dependent enzyme kinetics and docking studies were carried out to understand the nature of inhibition. Key findings Vcpal potently inhibited 5-LOX when compared with its inhibitory effect on sLOX (IC50; 2.5 and 10.3μm respectively, P= 0.003). Further, Vcpal inhibited 5-LOX more strongly than the known synthetic drugs: phenidone and nordihydroguaiaretic acid (P= 0.0007). Enzyme kinetic studies demonstrated Vcpal as a non-competitive reversible inhibitor of 5-LOX. In-silico molecular docking revealed high MolDock and Rerank score for Vcpal than ascorbic acid, complementing in-vitro results. Conclusion Both in-vitro and docking studies demonstrated Vcpal but not ascorbic acid as a non-competitive inhibitor of 5-LOX- and sLOX-induced lipid peroxidation, suggesting a key role for lipophilic nature in bringing about inhibition. © 2013 Royal Pharmaceutical Society.},

abstract={In this paper, we proposed to combine the transform based approach with dimensionality reduction technique for off-line signature verification. The proposed approach has four major phases: Preprocessing, Feature extraction, Feature reduction and Classification. In the feature extraction phase, Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is employed on the signature image to obtain the upper-left corner block of size mX n as a representative feature vector. These features are subjected to Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for further reduction and representing the signature with optimal set of features. Thus obtained features from all the samples in the dataset form the knowledge base. The Support Vector Machine (SVM), a bilinear classifier is used for classification and the performance is measured through FAR/FRR metric. Experiments have been conducted on standard signature datasets namely CEDAR and GPDS-160, and MUKOS, a regional language (Kannada) dataset.

abstract={With an objective to investigate the influence of nanoclay (NC) on the mechanical, thermal, and morphological properties of polyurethane (PU) in the presence of 5 wt% of ginger spent (GS), PU/GS/NC nanocomposite films were fabricated by a solution intercalation method with varying amounts, namely 0, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 wt%, of NC. The fabricated PU/GS/NC nanocomposite films were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The mechanical properties such as the tensile strength, tensile modulus, percentage elongation at break, and surface hardness have been performed for nanocomposites. FT-IR and XRD analysis show the nature of the NC interaction with the PU matrix, whereas SEM images show agglomeration of NC and entanglement of polymer chains with NC with an increase in the NC content. It was found that the tensile strength of the biocomposites increased from 4.5 to 13.7 MPa, tensile modulus increased from 8.2 to 14.3 MPa, and surface hardness increased from 70 to 77 shore A, whereas the percentage elongation at break decreased from 155.2% to 100.5%. Static water contact angle measurements on the surface of the PU/GS/NC nanocomposites reveal a reduction in surface polarity by way of changes in the contact angle from 76.83° to 55.24°, whereas surface energy increased from 88.36 to 102.11 mJ/m2 with an increase in the NC content. With an increase in the NC content, the chemical resistance of the green composites in different chemical environments improved. Thermal analysis by a thermogravimetric analyzer indicates improvement in thermal stability with an increase in the NC content. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={This paper presents FPGA implementation of minutiae extraction and false minutiae elimination for fingerprint image. A biometric system provides automatic identification of an individual based on a unique feature or characteristic possessed by the individual. Despite the widespread use of fingerprints, there is a little statistical theory on the uniqueness of fingerprint minutiae. A critical step in studying the statistics of fingerprint minutiae is to reliably extract minutiae from the fingerprint images. However, fingerprint images are rarely of perfect quality which requires image preprocessing techniques prior to minutiae extraction and false minutiae elimination. This will provide more reliable estimation of minutiae locations. Minutiae extraction and false minutiae elimination processes are implemented as a single block on FPGA. The FPGA configuration is generally specified using a hardware description language (HDL). © 2014 Springer India.},

Morphological studies of wax microspheres were evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The SEM images showed the spherical shape of wax microspheres and more than 97% of the isolated microspheres were in the size range 309-317 μm. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier transforms infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and stability studies showed that the drug after encapsulation with SC microspheres was stable and compatible. A single dose, randomized, complete cross over study of LX (8mg) microspheres were carried out on 10 healthy male and female Albino sheep’s under fasting conditions.

Further, Fisher's Linear Discriminant Analysis(FLDA) is applied for K = 4 mixtures to preserve useful discriminatory information in reduced feature space. Finally, six different distance measures are used for classification purpose to obtain an average classification rate.

abstract={In the current image retrieval systems, there exists a problem of defining and identifying efficient features in order to successfully bridge the gap between low level and high level semantics. In this regard, we propose an approach of efficiently extracting semantic features by combination of EM algorithm and PCA techniques, and thereby exploring PCA-Mixture Model with various similarity techniques for image retrieval system. Firstly, Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is applied to learn mixture of eigen values to obtain optimized maximum likelihood clusters. secondly, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied for different mixtures in order to extract efficient features. Further classification is performed using five different distance metrics. Our proposed method reported state-of-the-art classification rate with lesser features and achieved promising results in classifying Caltech-101 object categories compared with other baseline methods performed on the same dataset. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

abstract={Attention Deficiency Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) as a disruptive behavior disorder is receiving lots of attention because of its complexity and need for early detection. This paper presents a study on identification of potential biomarkers in the diagnosis of ADHD based on the structural-MRI of the brain obtained through ADHD-200 competition data set. The region of the brain considered here is 'hippocampus'. The grey matter probability of the T1 images is segmented followed by tissue alignment and inter subject normalization. Then, the voxels of the hippocampus are segregated using a region-of-interest mask, and the grey matter tissue probability values are obtained. These values are then used as features to classify ADHD patients against typically developing controls using a projection based learning algorithm for a meta-cognitive radial basis function network (PBL-McRBFN) and compared the results with that of support vector machines. Initially we take all the voxels of hippocampus for our study and then we have selected the most relevant voxels as a biomarker using Chi-square approach and developed a classifier to diagnosis ADHD. The results clearly highlight that use of hippocampus from the structural-MRI is sufficient to diagnosis ADHD to certain degree of confidence. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Two of the aims of laboratory one-dimensional consolidation tests are prediction of the end of primary settlement, and determination of the coefficient of consolidation of soils required for the time rate of consolidation analysis from time-compression data. Of the many methods documented in the literature to achieve these aims, Asaoka’s method is a simple and useful tool, and yet the most neglected one since its inception in the geotechnical engineering literature more than three decades ago. This paper appraises Asaoka’s method, originally proposed for the field prediction of ultimate settlement, from the perspective of laboratory consolidation analysis along with recent developments. It is shown through experimental illustrations that Asaoka’s method is simpler than the conventional and popular methods, and makes a satisfactory prediction of both the end of primary compression and the coefficient of consolidation from laboratory one-dimensional consolidation test data. © 2014, Thomas Telford Services Ltd.

abstract={Vast applications of peroxidases create an increasing demand to characterize peroxidases from new sources with more applicability potential. The aim of the present study was to check the presence of peroxidase activity from Caralluma umbellata. This is the first report on the C. umbellata peroxidase (CUP). The presence of peroxidase was revealed by the histochemical analysis of the stem sections, zymographic studies, and in vitro peroxidase activity assay using various reducing substrates viz., 2, 2′-azinobis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), guaiacol, o-dianisidine, and ferulic acid. The band pattern in zymogram confirms that CUP has a molecular weight less than that of horseradish peroxidase (44kDa). Comparative evaluation of peroxidase activity of CUP with respect to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) indicates that CUP catalyzes ABTS and ferulic acid in a similar pattern as HRP but with guaiacol, the extent of catalysis shown by CUP over HRP is high. The standard inhibitors sodium azide and sodium meta bisulphite inhibited CUP activity in a dose dependent manner. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media.},

abstract={Epoxy resin based nanocomposites with silica (SiO2), alumina (Al2O3) and zinc oxide (ZnO) as nano fillers were fabricated to investigate the relationship between the polarization and depolarization current. The polarization and depolarization current, charge carrier mobility, absorption current and nano size free volume cavities of nano dielectric epoxy composites and their interrelation are discussed. It is observed that the current magnitude increases in the three nanocomposites with loading of nano SiO2, Al2O3 and ZnO and the peak width of each composite is greater than that of pure epoxy. Free volume studies are carried out using positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS). From the results it is observed that molecular polarizability decreases and charge carrier mobility increases with the incorporation of SiO2, Al2O3 and ZnO loading. This trend is typical in Al 2O3, whereas in case of SiO2 the molecular polarizability is unaffected and with ZnO, molecular polarizability and charge carrier mobility decrease above 10 wt% filler. The Al2O3 nanofillers are structurally different as compared to SiO2 and ZnO fillers. It is observed that Al2O3 has more influence on polarizability of the composite.},

abstract={The development of commercially viable "green products" based on natural resources for both matrices and reinforcements for a wide range of applications is on the rise. This effort includes new pathways to produce natural polymers with better mechanical properties and thermal stability using nanotechnology and use of naturally occurring fillers such as lignocellulosic and hemicellulose to make biodegradable rubber composites. The blends of acrylonitrile butadiene rubber (NBR) and styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) with ginger powder (GP) have been prepared by using a compounding technique in presence of different amounts of crysnanoclay (CN). The physico-mechanical properties, such as tensile strength, modulus at 100% and 200% elongation at break and hardness of the composites before and after heat ageing have been studied. After heat ageing most of the properties improved. A markedly improvement or retain in tensile properties (strength and modulus) after incorporation of crysnanoclay into rubber was noticed. Presence of GP is resulted a higher water sorption but after incorporation of CN the water sorption tended to decrease. The dispersion of GP and CN in rubber matrix was analysed from scanning electron microscopy (SEM).},

abstract={In order to realize more benefits and to have more effective output from the mechanical ground improvement projects, the field soils are subjected to over consolidation. This process induces a characteristic yield stress in the compacted soil mass similar to that exhibited by the soil masses subjected to natural processes of over consolidation during their geological life time. In view of the absence of any documented geotechnical engineering literature on such an important topic, this paper intends to throw some useful light on compaction induced yield stress in fine-grained soils. A detailed discussion of various factors contributing to the induced yield stress as a consequence of compaction is done. The results of the present experimental study indicates that the values of compaction induced yield stress increase from dry side of optimum to optimum compacted state. This stress may tend to achieve an equilibrium value or decrease beyond optimum compacted state depending upon the contribution from the coarser fraction composing the soil. It is also illustrated that the soils subjected to same compactive effort exhibit different values of yield stress as a consequence of clay mineralogical composition of the soils. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={This paper reports the results of some experimental studies on the use of different types of manufactured sand in cement mortar. Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GBFS) sand which is a ferrous slag and Crushed Granite Sand (CGS) obtained from vertical cone crusher are considered. These two are the generally used alternative sand in India for use in mortar and concrete. In this investigation, cement mortar mix 1:3 and the replacement of Natural Sand (NS) by GBFS and CGS at various percentages is considered at different water cement ratios namely 0.4, 0.5 and 0.6. With the addition of manufactured sand the workability of mortar in terms of flow decreases gradually as the replacement level increases. This is mainly due to irregular features of the surface characteristics and also due to higher water absorption capacity. The manufactured sand exhibited better strength due to good bond characteristics. The reduction in flow varies over a wide range depending on the type and percentage of replacement levels. This loss in flow can be adjusted by adding suitable dosage of superplasticiser. From this study it is observed that the manufactured sand is a good alternative for the natural river sand in mortar provided the workability is compensated by adding suitable dosage of plasticiser. In spite of this, manufactured sand is quite economical. In addition durability studies are necessary for making concrete conclusions.},

The UV-vis analysis reveals the interaction of ZnOCe 2O3 nanoparticles through hydroxyl groups of PVA. Photoluminescence spectra shows intense emission peaks due to the presence of ZnOCe2O3 nanoparticles. Microwave irradiation analysis shows the effect of nanoparticles on the degradation profile of PVA. The band gap energy measured based on UV-vis analysis shows enhanced conductivity of PVA films. XRD analysis shows the effect of annealing temperature on the XRD patterns of PVA. DSC analysis shows reduction in percentage of crystallinity with an increase in annealing temperatures and nanoparticles concentration. Thermal analysis by TGA shows enhanced thermal stability for the nanocomposites as compared to the PVA matrix.

abstract={In this paper, we present a novel approach for the identification of critical brain regions responsible for Parkinson's disease (PD) based on magnetic resonance images (MRI) using meta-cognitive radial basis function network (McRBFN) classifier with Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE). The McRBFN classifier uses voxel based morphometric (VBM) features extracted from MRI and employs a projection based learning (PBL) algorithm. The meta-cognitive learning present in PBL-McRBFN helps in selecting proper samples to learn based on its current knowledge and evolve the architecture automatically. Since, the classifier developed using PBL-McRBFN is efficient, we propose recursive feature elimination approach (called PBL-McRBFN-RFE) to identify most relevant brain regions responsible for PD prediction. The study has been conducted using the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) data set. First, we conducted the study on PD prediction using the PBL-McRBFN classifier on the PPMI data set. We have also compared the results of the PBL-McRBFN classifier with the support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The study results clearly show that the PBL-McRBFN classifier produces better generalization performance on PD prediction. Finally, we use RFE approach with PBL-McRBFN to identify the brain regions responsible for PD. The PBL-McRBFN-RFE selected features indicate that the loss of gray matter in the superior temporal gyrus region may be responsible for the onset of PD, and is consistent with the earlier findings from medical research studies. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Plant pathogens like 'Ca. Liberibacter', phytoplasma, viruses and viroids cause diseases to almost all economically important plants. A simple and fast sap-mediated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method for the detection of these pathogens infecting various plant hosts is described in the present study. Sap from selected plants was drawn aseptically on parafilm, from the mid-rib of young leaves. Depending on the type of host plant, sap was diluted to optimal concentration before PCR analysis. 'Ca. Liberibacter', Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) and Citrus exocortis viroid (CEVd) infecting citrus, and 'Ca. Phytoplasma' infecting pepper and sandal trees were tested by sap-mediated PCR. The reliability of this procedure was evaluated by comparing the findings with previously described protocols. The sap-mediated nucleic acid template preparation for PCR assay is devoid of laborious nucleic acid extraction and expensive chemicals. Hence the present method is rapid, economical and so can be employed for diagnosis of large number of plant samples. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={Xanthine oxidase (XO) is a complex metalloflavoprotein, the overproduction of which usually leads to a pathological condition called gout. The XO inhibitors may prove to be promising antigout agents. The XO generates superoxide anions and H2O2 for the self-defense system of the organism. Abnormal production of this superoxide (reactive oxygen species) is responsible for a number of complications including inflammation, metabolic disorder, cellular aging, reperfusion damage, atherosclerosis, and carcinogenesis. In this paper, we report the synthesis of N-substituted analogs of thiazolidinedione derivatives as effective and new class of XO inhibitors and also as antioxidant agents. Among all the compounds in the series, compound 2i produced relatively better activity against human milk XO (72% inhibition), which was also supported by docking studies. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

abstract={Objective: The aim of the present work was to improve the dissolution of poorly water-soluble drug Aripiprazole (ARP) and to understand the effect hydrophilic carriers [guar gum(GG), modified guar gum (MGG), and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC)]on drug solubility. Methods: Physical Mixture (PM), ground mixtures (GM) and solid dispersions (SD) were prepared by simple mixing, metal ball mill (MBM) and solvent evaporation method, respectively. Results: The solubility of ARP in simulated gastric fluid and simulated intestinal fluid at 37°C was found to be 76.78 μg/mL and 291μg/mL, respectively. Grinding time affects the dissolution rate was observed. Ground mixture develops more fine particles and show less friability index than physical mixture and solid dispersion. FTIR studies reveals no chemical interaction between drug and carriers. The carriers showed the wettability of the ground products in the order MGG > GG >HPMC. The order of dissolution rate enhancement of the different hydrophilic carriers was in the order of MGG>GG>HPMC. GM containing MGM showed better dissolution than SD and PM. Conclusion: From the study it was concluded that grinded ARP with hydrophilic carriers improved the dissolution rate not only due to particle size reduction, but also resulted from the ability of these carriers to prevent aggregation of the finely divided drug particles, to improve wettability and to inhibit recrystallization during dissolution.},

abstract={The transcription factor STAT3 is constitutively overexpressed in many human tumors and hence represents a putative target for anticancer drug design. In this work, we describe the synthesis and biological evaluation of a novel chemotype, pyridine-fused pyrazoles ('PFPs') as inhibitors of STAT3 phosphorylation. The effect of the compounds synthesized was evaluated in cell proliferation assays of MCF-7 and HepG2 cancer cell lines and two of the compounds tested (12g and 12k) were found to show significant activity. Both compounds were also found to inhibit the proliferation of Hep3B, HUH-7 and PLC/PRF5 HCC cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, we established in a DNA binding assay that one of the compounds (12g) was able to significantly inhibit the DNA binding ability of STAT3. Cytotoxicity of 12g against PC3 cells, which do not constitutively phosphorylate STAT3, was found to be minimal, hence lending further support for our mode-of-action hypothesis of this compound. We established for this structure a complete inhibition of CXCL12-induced cell invasion and associated wound healing in HCCLM3 cells, corroborating the proposed modulation of the STAT3 axis by 12g. Finally, molecular modeling was employed to evaluate the hypothesis of PFPs to bind to the SH2 domain of STAT3. Given the efficacy of PFPs in the biological systems studied here we propose their further evaluation in the context of STAT3-mediated cancer therapy. © 2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={Pulmonary auscultation is a vastly using diagnosis method over centuries. Together with the breath sound, there is a possibility of hearing heart sound, since both sounds are originated from the human chest. For the electronic analysis of the breath sound, separation of heart sound (HS) is important. In this paper, the separation of HS is achieved by using a modified Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) method, by introducing a provision for adaptive selection of SSA parameters. The advantage is Eigen triple grouping in the reconstruction stage of SSA is adaptive, that reduces the human effort. The performance of the new method is evaluated using synthetically mixed data and the real respiratory data and compared the results with the Advanced Line Enhancer (ALE) method which is an established single channel adaptive method. This method can also be useful for localizing the HS interferences in respiratory data, in some heart sound cancellation technique, where the localization is a fundamental preprocessing step. The comparative results suggest that the proposed method is more suitable for both separation and localization of heart sounds than the original ALE. © 2013 IEEE.},

The MFCCs are computed for each wavelet sub band and GMM-UBM score is obtained. The decision is taken by combining GMM-UBM scores of individual sub bands. When the 18MFCC features are given to GMM-UBM classifier it can be seen that the accuracy is 85.18%. But when the wavelet based 18MFCCs are given, the accuracy is 93.32%, which indicates that wavelet based MFCCs improves the classification accuracy. © 2013 IEEE.},

These features are extracted and are used as a basis for an automated identification and classification. The advancement in image processing has made this a quick and easy process. In the proposed work, Morphological features and Zernike moments are used to identify and classify the plant leaves. The features extracted are independent of leaf growth and image translation, rotation and scaling and are studied to develop an approach that produces the best classification algorithm. First, the developed algorithms are used to classify a training set of images. Then, a testing set of images is used for verifying the classification algorithms. The output displays the leaf classified into its particular class. © 2013 IEEE.},

These regions play a vital role in the control of emotional response and behavior/locomotion, respectively. The images are preprocessed, registered by transforming each image to the space of the population average. The gray matter tissue probability values of amygdala and cerebellar vermis are obtained by applying a region-of-interest mask. These values are then used to train a Projection Based Learning algorithm for a Metacognitive Radial Basis Function Network (PBL-McRBFN) for the diagnosis of ADHD and prediction of its subtype. Performance results show that the PBL-McRBFN diagnoses ADHD and predicts its subtypes based on these regions with an accuracy of approx. 65% and 62%, respectively. © Springer International Publishing 2013.},

abstract={To build an efficient OCR system, preprocessing task of segmentation process should be in accurate way. In segmentation process, character segmentation plays an important role to obtain clear isolated characters. Character segmentation in Kannada word is a crucial task due to the presence of bottom extension characters (called as Vatthus in Kannada and as extra modifiers in English) and Modifiers. Due to the presence of modifiers and few cursive form of characters the script becomes semi-cursive while writing. With this nature some of the letters are touching each other and also bottom extension characters may get touch to main characters. In this regard, an enhanced Character Segmentation (eCS) approach is proposed for an unconstrained handwritten Kannada scripts. The method is based on thinning, branch point and mixture models. The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is used to learn the mixture of Gaussians. A cluster mean points are used to estimate the direction and branch point as a reference point for segmenting characters. We experimentally evaluated the proposed method on Kannada words and shown encouraging results. © 2013 Springer International Publishing.},

abstract={Normally gray images are less potential with the optical flow, especially to emulate relevant information. Since very long time the color optical flow strategy had been ignored. In this work, we are proposing a strategy which attempts to separate out the optical flow for each channels such as R, G and B through Horn-Schunk with Barren, Fleet and Beuchemin (BFB) kernel. Subsequently, obtained upshots are overlaid to get the rich information of the motion to detach the moving objects. Consequently the histograms of the moving objectss are employed to create the regression lines and extract productmoment correlation of each moving object. This coefficient utilized to match between the template and the candidate templates. Hence the template is updated with the best match. Further the bounding box is enclosed over the object based on spatial information of updated template. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Major parts of India are vulnerable to many natural disasters such as earthquakes, cyclones, floods or tsunami all of which exert lateral dynamic forces on structures. Hence, a structure designed for safety against wind or water is likely to perform better during earthquakes and vice versa. Further, the recent interest and challenge in the field of structural engineering is to assess the damage vulnerability of the existing structures for the seismic loading and to carry out performance based retrofitting. To assess the seismic load carrying capacity of existing building, the viable method is pushover analysis which is a non-linear static approach. Hence, in the present paper, an attempt is made to evaluate the seismic capacity of structural frames designed for only gravity loading, earthquake loading and wind loading. Base shear carrying capacity of frames designed for different loading conditions are compared. The results show that frames designed for wind loading perform better than those designed only for gravity loading during earthquakes. The effect of lateral loads in design is more pronounced in 8 storey frames than in 2 storey frames and frames designed for lateral loads carry more base shear and experience lower roof displacements. Besides, frames designed only for gravity loading possesses sufficient seismic capacity and the lateral load carrying capacity decreases with increase in height. © 2013 CAFET-INNOVA TECHNICAL SOCIETY.},

abstract={In this paper, we present an approach based on chain code histogram features enhanced through Laplacian of Gaussian filter for off-line signature verification. In the proposed approach, the four-directional chain code histogram of each grid on the contour of the signature image is extracted. The Laplacian of Gaussian filter is used to enhance the extracted features of each signature sample. Thus, the extracted and enhanced features of all signature samples of the off-line signature dataset constitute the knowledge base. Subsequently, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is used as the verification tool. The SVM is trained with the randomly selected training sample's features including genuine and random forgeries and tested with the remaining untrained genuine along with the skilled forge sample features to classify the tested/questioned sample as genuine or forge. Similar to the real time scenario, in the proposed approach we have not considered the skilled fore sample to train the classifier. Extensive experimentations have been conducted to exhibit the performance of the proposed approach on the publicly available datasets namely, CEDAR, GPDS-100 and MUKOS, a regional language dataset. The state-of-art off-line signature verification methods are considered for comparative study to justify the feasibility of the proposed approach for off-line signature verification and to reveal its accuracy over the existing approaches. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, we present a novel approach for classification of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and normal subjects from Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) using a proposed 'sequential Projection Based Learning for Meta-cognitive q-Gaussian Radial Basis Function Network (PBL-McqRBFN)' classifier. The McqRBFN has two components, namely, a cognitive component and a meta-cognitive components. The cognitive component is a single hidden layer Radial Basis Function (RBF) network with a q-Gaussian activation function, that allows different RBF's in one network, like the Gaussian, the Inverse Multiquadratic, and the Cauchy functions, by changing a real q-parameter. The meta-cognitive component present in McqRBFN helps in selecting proper samples to learn based on its current knowledge and evolve architecture automatically. The McqRBFN employs a sequential Projection Based Learning (PBL) algorithm to reduce the computational effort used in training. For simulation studies, we have used MRI data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. Voxel Based Morphometry (VBM) is used for feature extraction from MRI data and extracted VBM features are fed into the PBL-McqRBFN classifier. The experimental results show that our proposed PBL-McqRBFN classifier can accurately differentiate MCI and normal subjects. © 2013 IEEE.},

McRBFN emulates human-like meta-cognitive learning principles. As each sample is presented to the network, the McRBFN uses the estimated class label, the maximum hinge error and class-wise significance to address the self-regulating principles of what-to-learn, when-to-learn and how-to-learn in a meta-cognitive framework. Initially, McRBFN begins with zero hidden neurons and adds required number of neurons to approximate the decision surface. When a neuron is added, its parameters are initialized based on the sample overlapping conditions. The output weights are updated using a PBL algorithm such that the network finds the minimum point of an energy function defined by the hinge-loss error. Moreover, as samples with similar information are deleted, over-training is avoided. The PBL algorithm helps to reduce the computational effort used in training. For simulation studies, we have used MR images from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) data set. The performance of the PBL-McRBFN classifier is evaluated on complete morphometric features set obtained from the VBM analysis. The performance evaluation study clearly indicates the superior performance of PBL-McRBFN classifier over other classification algorithms. © 2013 IEEE.},

From the experimentally measured critical loads, the mode I, mode II and the various mixed mode I/II critical stress intensity factors at crack initiation have been determined by the aid of finite element analysis. Based on these results the parameters for a fracture criterion for the composite under consideration have been determined. After testing, both edges of the sample and the fracture surfaces were examined with a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The results infer that the ascendancies of Mode-I and Mode -II are highly dependent on loading angle (LA). © 2013 VBRI press.},

abstract={Intrusion detection is not yet a perfect technology. This has given data mining the opportunity to make several important contributions to the field of intrusion detection. In this paper, we have proposed a new technique by utilizing data mining techniques such as neuro-fuzzy and radial basis support vector machine (SVM) for the intrusion detection system. The proposed technique has four major steps in which, first step is to perform the Fuzzy C-means clustering (FCM). Then, neuro-fuzzy is trained, such that each of the data point is trained with the corresponding neuro-fuzzy classifier associated with the cluster. Subsequently, a vector for SVM classification is formed and in the fourth step, classification using radial SVM is performed to detect intrusion has happened or not. Data set used is the KDD cup 99 dataset and we have used sensitivity, specificity and accuracy as the evaluation metrics parameters. Our technique could achieve better accuracy for all types of intrusions. It achieved about 98.94 % accuracy in case of DOS attack and reached heights of 97.11 % accuracy in case of PROBE attack. In case of R2L and U2R attacks it has attained 97.78 and 97.80 % accuracy respectively. We compared the proposed technique with the other existing state of art techniques. These comparisons proved the effectiveness of our technique. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media.},

BB-CELM and PE-CELM use the bilinear transformation with a branch-cut at 2π and the phase encoded transformation, respectively, at the input layer to transform the feature space from the real domain to complex domain (R → ℂ). A complex-valued activation function of the type of hyperbolic secant employed at the hidden layer maps the complex-valued feature space to a hyper dimensional complex space (ℂm → ℂk K &gt; m). BB-CELM and PE-CELM are trained by choosing the hidden layer parameters randomly and computing the output weights analytically. Therefore, these classifiers require minimal computational effort during the training process. The performances of these classifiers are evaluated on a set of benchmark classification problems from the UCI machine learning repository and a practical acoustic emission signal classification problem. The results of the performance study highlight the superior classification ability of BB-CELM and PE-CELM classifiers. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

The present technical note deals with the results from the study of permeability behavior of three-layer soil system.

abstract={In this paper, a novel method for detecting the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans is presented. It uses a combination of three different machine learning algorithms in order to get improved results and is based on a three-class classification problem. The three classes for classification considered in this study are normal, very mild AD and mild and moderate AD subjects. The machine learning algorithms used are: the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) for classification, with its performance optimized by a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and a Genetic algorithm (GA) used for feature selection. A Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) approach is used for feature extraction from the MRI images and GA is used to reduce the high dimensional features needed for classification. The GA-ELM-PSO classifier yields an average training accuracy of 94.57 % and a testing accuracy of 87.23 %, averaged across the three classes, over ten random trials. The results clearly indicate that the proposed approach can differentiate between very mild AD and normal cases more accurately, indicating its usefulness in detecting the onset of AD. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={A study was conducted to investigate the performance of fly ash as a sand replacing material (SRM) in concrete. Advantages of such concretes including the durability characteristics were discussed in the study. Data analysis revealed that this concrete had a better strength to weight ratio and strength to energy ratio while being a more eco-friendly and less energy intensive material. Investigations also revealed that strength to density ratio was a good indicator of the enhanced performance. Density reduction was achieved by increasing the paste content and decreasing the coarse aggregate content.},

abstract={Transesterified vegetable oils are becoming increasingly important as alternative fuels for diesel engines due to several advantages. Biodiesel is a renewable, inexhaustible and green fuel. This paper presents the various properties of the oils derived from Jatropha and Pongamia, their mixes and biodiesels derived from the mixes. An innovative lab scale reactor was designed and developed for biodiesel production from mixed vegetable oils and used for the study of optimization of biodiesel yield [1]. Also, the analysis of data of experimental investigations carried out on a 3.75 kW computerized CI engine at injection pressures of 160 and 180 bar with methyl esters of mixed Jatropha and Pongamia in various proportions are also presented. The brake thermal efficiency for biodiesel blends was found to be higher than that of petrodiesel at various loading conditions. In case of Composite biodiesel blended fuels, the exhaust gas temperature increased with increase in load and the amount of composite biodiesel. The highest exhaust gas temperature was observed as 213 °C for biodiesel among the five loading conditions. When petrodiesel was used the exhaust gas temperature was observed to be 220 °C. The CO2, CO, HC and NOx emissions from the biodiesel blends were lower than that of petrodiesel. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={The Upper Trinity River Basin supplies water to about one-fourth of Texas's population. The anticipated rapid growth of North Central Texas will certainly increase regional demands for high-quality drinking water. This has increased concerns that sedimentand nutrient loads received by drinking water reservoirs are reducing and will continue to reduce reservoir volumes and water quality. The objectives of this study are to calibrate and validate the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model for streamflow and sediment to assess current rates and sources of sediment loadings to 12 major reservoirs in the Upper Trinity River Basin (in 7 eight-digit watersheds) and to use the calibrated model for assessing the effects of upland ponds. SWAT performed well for streamflow, as evidenced by r2 values ranging from 0.55 to 0.95. Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency values ranged from 0.5 to 0.9 based on monthly streamflow comparisons between simulated and observed values for calibration, and r2 values ranged from 0.58 to 0.95 for validation. SWAT simulated sediment loads reasonably well, as evidenced by the percentage of errors within 11%. Streamflow and sediment loading were quite diverse across the Trinity River Basin, resulting in a multitude of parameter adjustments during calibration. Long-term predictions indicate that the Richland-Chambers, Ray Hubbard, and Lavon watersheds have significant channel contribution to sediment loading reaching the reservoirs. Pond removal scenario analysis shows a 4% to 48% reduction in sediment loadings to reservoirs via pond detention of overland flow. This wide range is mainly due to the vastly different proportion of land area draining to ponds, the locations of ponds, and the basin's erosion (upland and channel) characteristics within each study watershed. The results indicate that in addition to implementing conservation practices such as ponds in upland areas, it is also necessary to have conservation practices in channels to further reduce erosion and subsequent loss to reservoirs. One limitation of this study is the lack of site-specific management information, and it is known that poor management practices at the field level can dramatically elevate sediment loads from an area. In this study, reasonable management operations were applied mainly at the county conservation district level. Opportunity exists for further data collection, including detailed data of field management and channel dimensions, which will allow the model to provide greater insight in identifying sensitive areas and reaches for stabilization and restoration. Opportunity also exists for further evaluation of the effects of optimizing pond size and placement to minimize reservoir sediment loading. © 2013 Soil and Water Conservation Society.

abstract={This paper proposes a text independent method for the classification of normal and pathological voices. If the classifier is text dependent i.e classifier is trained for a particular phoneme, then it may difficult for the patient to pronounce the particular phoneme. To overcome this difficulty, a text independent classification method is proposed, which uses Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) and Gaussian Mixture Model-Universal Background Model (GMM-UBM). The GMM-UBM model is trained with phonemes /a/, /e/, /u/ of normal and pathological voices. Hence the classifier is efficient to detect voices of different phonemes and classifies them into normal and pathological with a maximum accuracy of 85.63%. It has been noticed that, accuracy of classification can be improved by increasing the number of MFCCs, i.e the classification accuracy is 72.45% for 12 MFCCs, where as 85.63 % for 24 MFCCs. © 2013 IEEE.},

The results of the ICGA-ELM classifier is compared with that of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The results indicate that the ICGA-ELM classifier produces a mean testing accuracy of 91.86% with only 10 features whereas, the SVM produces a mean testing accuracy of 86.84% for the same set.

OFD exhibits higher performance than Fisher Linear Discriminant (FLD) due to the elimination of dependences among discriminant vectors.

abstract={With an objective to investigate the influence of molybdenum disulphide (MoS 2 ) on physico-mechanical and tribological properties of polyamide 66 (PA 66), was compounded with MoS 2 in the presence of carbon black (CB). The compounded material was injection molded to make test specimens to evaluate physico-mechanical, thermal, and tribological (wear, friction, and laser etching) characteristics. It was found that tensile strength, percentage elongation at break, and tensile modulus of PA 66/CB/MoS 2 composite increased linearly with increase in MoS 2 content. The impact strength of the PA 66 matrix increased from 37.2 to 43.2 J/m with an increase in MoS 2 content. The wear behavior of PA 66/CB/MoS 2 composites have been investigated under dry sliding conditions at different normal loads, sliding distances, and sliding velocities at room temperature. It was found that the introduction of MoS 2 in the presence of CB has certainly reduced the friction, wear behavior of PA 66 with improvement in laser etching resistance. MoS 2 could increase the adhesion between the transfer film and the counterface surface. The ability of the synergistic fillers in helping the formation of thin, uniform, and continuous transfer film would contribute to enhance the wear resistance of PA 66 composites.

abstract={The rising availability of digital music stipulates effective categorization and retrieval methods. Real world scenarios are characterized by mammoth music collections through pertinent and non-pertinent songs with reference to the user input. The primary goal of the research work is to counter balance the perilous impact of non-relevant songs through Progressive Filtering (PF) for Query by Humming (QBH) system. PF is a technique of problem solving through reduced space. This paper presents the concept of PF and its efficient design based on Multi-Resolution Histograms (MRH) to accomplish searching in manifolds. Initially the entire music database is searched to obtain high recall rate and narrowed search space. Later steps accomplish slow search in the reduced periphery and achieve additional accuracy. Experimentation on large music database using recursive programming substantiates the potential of the method. The outcome of proposed strategy glimpses that MRH effectively locate the patterns. Distances of MRH at lower level are the lower bounds of the distances at higher level, which guarantees evasion of false dismissals during PF. In due course, proposed method helps to strike a balance between efficiency and effectiveness. The system is scalable for large music retrieval systems and also data driven for performance optimization as an added advantage. © 2013 Springer.},

abstract={The Stretch of Biometrics' applications can only be limited by limiting ones' imagination! Biometrics is the Science and Technology of measuring and analyzing biological data for authentication purposes. In addition to verification the guiding force behind biometric verification has been convinience. Face enjoys a prime position in the realm of biometrics because it is very easily accessible when compared to the other biometrics. Efficient accomplishment of Face Recognition confronts innumerable hurdles in the form of variations in lighting conditions during image capture, Occlusions, damage in facial portions due to accidents etc. The application of Facial Image Inpainting also fails when the occlusions or the deformalities are present across the boundary of the object of interest(face), since the bounds for the application of the inpainting algorithm is not precisely defined. Hence recovery of the complete picture of a human face from partially occluded images is quite a challenge in Image Processing. The proposed FIREACH algorithm concentrates on the generation of a convex hull and a non linear elliptical approximation of the depleted and partially visible boundary of the human face, given different parameters to achieve an Efficient Boundary Recovery. The Boundary Recovery Algorithm is a pre-processing step which aids in setting up of a suitable platform for the proficient application of the Facial Image Inpainting. © 2013 Springer.},

abstract={Dual component microcapsules of diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A epoxy (DGEBA) (resin) and polyetheramine (hardener) for the self-healing agencies of epoxy were prepared by a water-in-oil-in-water emulsion solvent evaporation technique with the polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) shell. The chemical structure and morphologies of the microcapsules were confirmed using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively. The thermal characteristics of the microcapsules were investigated using thermo-analytical techniques such as differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Dual components microcapsules of resin and curing agent were embedded into the epoxy matrix and the healing behavior of the system was studied. About 43.5% healing efficiency was achieved with 5 wt.% microcapsules and 84.5% healing efficiency was achieved with 15 wt.% microcapsules at room temperature for 24 h curing. The healing efficiency of the composite with the dual component microcapsules was higher than that of the composite with the single component healing microcapsule due to the easy reaction between the liquid resin and the liquid hardener at the crack surface. The tensile strength of the epoxy with dual component microcapsules increased initially with increasing the content of microcapsules and reached the maximum at 5 wt.%. Above this point, the tensile strength decreased gradually with increasing. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

WT provides both spatial and spectral characteristics (i.e., texture information) of pixels and hence can be utilized effectively for improving quality of salient region detection. As a result, the proposed method generates full resolution maps with uniformly highlighted regions with well defined boundaries, and invariant to translation, rotation and scaling that make it more useful in applications like object segmentation / recognition and adaptive compression. The superiority of the proposed method over the existing, is demonstrated both qualitatively and quantitatively using the indexes like precision and recall with a large set of benchmark data sets. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Logic synthesis is a novel architectural concept used for converting a high level description of logic circuit into optimized gate level description. The method ranges from transforming a RTL description to producing an optimized netlist. Logic minimization plays an important role in optimization of logic synthesis. This optimization is done through the function minimization through different existing methods. The existing work on function minimization has resulted into many algorithms. In the proposed work, we form the basis for our synthesis engines vide detailed performance analysis and insight into the various minimization algorithms proposed erstwhile, and apply them on some real example circuit. We plan to propose our own algorithm as well for enhanced performance.},

abstract={The study involves synthesis of polypropylene grafted with glycidyl methacrylate (PP-g-GMA) using three different initiators, benzoyl peroxide, dicumyl peroxide and tertiary butyl cumyl peroxide (TBSP). Among the peroxides used, dicumyl peroxide resulted in considerable reduction of molecular weight of the resulting graft copolymer. The melting/crystallization behavior and isothermal crystallization kinetics of PP homopolymer and PP-g-GMA copolymers were studied with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) at high undercooling (44-60 C). The results showed that the degree of crystallinity and overall crystallization rate of copolymers is greater than that of virgin PP. Among the three initiators used, TBCP exhibited lowest half crystallization time. The isothermal crystallization kinetics of the PP and copolymers was described with the Avrami equation and Sestak-Berggren (SB) equation. The Avrami exponent n of the PP and copolymers were found to be in the range 1.03 to 1.41 at high undercooling conditions employed in this study. The agreement between the values of n calculated from SB kinetics and Avrami equation is satisfactory with few exceptions. The crystallization rate of PP-g-GMA copolymer was found to be more sensitive to temperature. The isothermally crystallized samples showed a single melting peak for PP while a double peak at lower temperature was recorded for PP-g-GMA copolymer samples. The equilibrium melting point was deduced according to Hoffman-Weeks theory. The decrease of recorded for the PP modified with GMA suggests that the thermodynamic stability of the PP crystals is influenced by the chemical interactions. © 2013 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

abstract={This article presents a novel full-reference (FR) image quality assessment (QA) algorithm by depicting the sub-band characteristics in the wavelet domain. The proposed image quality assessment method is based on energy estimation in the wavelet-transformed image. Image QA is achieved by applying a multilevel wavelet decomposition on both the original and the enhanced image. Next, the wavelet energy (WE) and vector are computed to obtain the percentage of the energy that corresponds to the approximation and the details, respectively. Further, the approximate and detailed energy levels of both the original and the enhanced images are compared to formulate an image quality assessment. Numerous experiments are conducted on a dozen of image enhancement algorithms. The results presented show that the image with poor contrast in the foreground than the background has continuous regular coefficient values. The probability density function for such an image has a relatively lower WE and skewness compared with the background. The proposed scheme not only evaluates the global information of an image but also estimates the fine, detailed changes in an enhanced image. Thus, the proposed metric serves as an objective and effective FR criterion for color image QA. The experimental results presented confirm that the proposed WE metric is an efficient and useful metric for evaluating the quality of the color image enhancement. © Elsevier BV 2013.},

abstract={In this paper, we present COD removal and water reclamation possibilities from electrochemical coagulation (ECC) of oily wastewaters with simultaneous removal of COD and color. Sacrificial electrode (Iron and Aluminum) dissolutions controlled by the cell voltage and current density were found as key factors for the formation of well settleable sludge ascribing water reclamation. ECC treated water slurry showed excellent settleability and filterability characteristics obtaining a clear supernatant. Optimal batch operating conditions using iron electrodes were: 6 iron plate electrodes in a 1.5L ECR with an applied cell voltage of 8.5V, run for 60 min electrolyze time (6E, 1.5L, 8.5V, 60min ET). Water reclamation of ~80%, with simultaneous color and COD removals of ~96% and 82% was achieved from the initial value of 1800 PCUs and 1200 mg/L respectively. Sacrificial electrodes developed dents on its surface during treatment at active zones. These active zones were seen swarmed with flocs after ECC, polarity reversal was resorted to remove the floc swarm on the sacrificial electrodes. The zero value of ΔpH lies at the pH0 value of 6.45 for iron electrodes, which is considered as the pHpzc of the dried sludge obtained from the batch ECC treatment of oily wastewater.},

The experimental results showed that the COD, ammonia nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen and phosphorus removal was found to be 94%, 90%, 89% and 94% respectively and the aluminum consumed was 0.2219 g with 120 minutes of electrolysis time. The BOD to COD ratio increased from 0.012 to 1.49 in 105 minutes of electrolysis duration, indicating improvement of wastewater biodegradability. Since there was an improvement of BOD/COD ratio, the EC treated wastewater was further treated in an anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (ASBR) to remove the remaining COD. In ASBR the COD removal was found to be 86% and more than 99% removal of nitrogen and phosphorus was observed. The combined electrochemical treatment followed by ASBR removes 98% of COD and the concentration of ammonia nitrogen, nitrate-nitrogen, phosphorus was below detection level in the effluent.},

abstract={Brake pad waste (BPW) powders were incorporated into styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) formulations with varying amounts [2.5, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 40 parts per hundred parts of resin (phr)], by replacing the same amount of carbon black (CB). The physico-mechanical properties of the SBR/CB/BPW vulcanizates were determined before and after heat aging at 90°C. There was a slight reduction in the tensile strength, tensile modulus and surface hardness, as the BPW filler content was increased in SBR vulcanizates, up to 5 phr of BPW content, and a further increase in the waste filler content reduced the property significantly. A significant improvement in the compression set was noticed up to 20 phr BPW content loaded SBR systems. This is due to the synergistic effect of CB and the BPW filler. Swelling studies in different aromatic organic solvents, and the rheological behaviors of SBR/CB/BPW, were also studied. The swelling index of all formulations increased and the crosslink density decreased, with increase in BPW content. The degree of reinforcement between the elastomer and the BPW was studied using the Kraus equation. © 2013 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.},

The phase morphology of dispersed HDPE phase changed from elongated domain to fine spherical domain, and the tensile modulus and heat distortion temperature of PC/HDPE blend increased with increase in PEG content. DSC analysis showed an inward shift in the glass transition temperature (T g), indicating enhanced compatibility between the PC and HDPE phases. Furthermore, PEG compatibilized PC/HDPE (80/20) blend was found to have very good notch performance and chemical resistance compared to PC. Hence, this blend can be used to design products with intricate shapes with less notch sensitivity and high chemical resistance with the superior mechanical performance of PC. © 2013 American Chemical Society.},

The mechanical characterization results confirm that the composite developed by using graphene nanoparticles represents a fundamental feature in enhancing the tensile elastic modulus and hardness behavior of the composite system, where as MWCNT has significant effect on the bending modulus and impact behavior. The optical microscopic study for the fractured samples reveals a significant increase in the fiber-matrix interface adhesion where as decrease in fiber breakage, fiber pullout and debonding. © 2013 VBRI press.},

abstract={The objective of this research work is to evaluate the tribological and physico-mechanical properties of molybdenum disulphide (MoS 2 ) loaded polyamide 6 composites in the presence of carbon black (CB). Polyamide 6 containing 1 wt% of carbon black powder was compounded and extruded with varying amounts viz., 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 wt%, MoS 2 in a co-rotating twin screw extruder. The fabricated polyamide 6 composites have been evaluated for tribological properties such as wear loss, specific wear rate and coefficient of friction, and physico-mechanical properties such as water uptake, density, surface hardness, tensile properties and impact strength. The effect of molybdenum disulphide content, abrading loads, sliding velocities and sliding distances on wear characteristics of the polyamide 6/CB/MoS 2 composites were evaluated using a pin-on-disc equipment. It was found that the introduction of MoS 2 has significantly reduced the, wear loss and friction behavior of pristine polyamide 6. Worn surfaces were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to have better insight on the wear mechanism. Furthermore the polyamide 6 composites showed significant improvement in tensile behavior. Additionally, the thermal characteristics of the composites also have been studied by using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={With the impending era of internet, the network security has become the key foundation for lot of financial and business web applications. Intrusion detection is one of the looms to resolve the problem of network security. Imperfectness of intrusion detection systems (IDS) has given an opportunity for data mining to make several important contributions to the field of intrusion detection. In recent years, many researchers are using data mining techniques for building IDS. Here, we propose a new approach by utilizing data mining techniques such as neuro-fuzzy and radial basis support vector machine (SVM) for helping IDS to attain higher detection rate. The proposed technique has four major steps: primarily, k-means clustering is used to generate different training subsets. Then, based on the obtained training subsets, different neuro-fuzzy models are trained. Subsequently, a vector for SVM classification is formed and in the end, classification using radial SVM is performed to detect intrusion has happened or not. To illustrate the applicability and capability of the new approach, the results of experiments on KDD CUP 1999 dataset is demonstrated. Experimental results shows that our proposed new approach do better than BPNN, multiclass SVM and other well-known methods such as decision trees and Columbia model in terms of sensitivity, specificity and in particular detection accuracy. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Polymeric nanocomposites were reported to enhance the barrier properties and lifetime of organic solar cells. In this investigation, we are reporting the development of one such nanocomposites by dispersing the lithium zirconate (Li2ZrO3) nanoparticles in polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) matrix. It was found that the incorporation of Li2ZrO3 nanoparticles has not affected the transparency of the PVA matrix in the visible region at the same time it generates fluorescence emission. The emission intensity increases with the nanoparticles concentration. Similarly microwave irradiation also does not show any transmittance peaks in the visible region even though it had a positive effect in the UV region. The dielectric properties (dielectric constant and dielectric loss) of PVA/Li2ZrO3 nanocomposites increase with increase in the nanoparticles concentration, while it decreases with an increase in frequency. The alternating current conductivity increases with the increase in filler loading and frequency.

abstract={To determine the possibility of using cotton fabric (CF) as reinforcement in the thermoplastic polymer matrix, woven CF-reinforced polypropylene (PP) composites were fabricated by the compression molding of PP sheets with 20% and 30 wt% of CF. The fabrication process involved laying up multiple layers of woven CF between precut extruded sheets of PP and compression molding to achieve 3.5-4.0 mm CF-reinforced PP composite laminate sheets. From the laminated sheets, test specimens were prepared and tested for tensile, flexural, and impact properties. It was found that the reinforcement of PP with 30% CF increased the tensile strength from 21.87 to 28.07 MPa, tensile modulus from 618 to 1867 MPa, flexural strength from 21.7 to 45.3 MPa, and flexural modulus from 813 to 1925 MPa. However, the tensile elongation at break decreased marginally from 26.72% to 20.99%. A multiaxial impact test indicates reduction in the total energy absorbed and the peak force of the fabric-reinforced laminates in comparison with neat PP. Coefficient of thermal expansion results on CF-reinforced PP laminate sheet indicate reduction in thermal expansion. Dynamic mechanical analysis of CF-reinforced PP shows an increase in the storage modulus and loss modulus. Scanning electron microscopic images reveal fibers pull out and breakages due to lack of an interfacial interaction between the CF and the PP matrix. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The fabricated nanocomposite films have been characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The effect of Na2ZrO3 nanoparticles on the electrical properties of PVA nanocomposites were analyzed by AC conductivity (σac), dielectric constant (*′), dielectric loss (*″), dielectric loss tangent (tan δ) and electric modulus (M′, M″) over a frequency domain from 100 Hz to 1 MHz at room temperature. FT-IR and XRD analysis shows the nature of Na2ZrO 3 nanoparticles interaction with the PVA matrix, while SEM images showed uniform dispersion of Na2ZrO3 nanoparticles in PVA matrix. AC conductivity (σac) of PVA/Na2ZrO 3 nanocomposites increases with increase in filler loading and frequency. The electrical properties such as dielectric constant (*′) and dielectric loss (*″) increases with an increase in the amount of nanoparticle, but decreases with frequency. Dielectric loss tangent (tan δ) increases with an increase in nanoparticles concentration, but decreases with frequency.

abstract={In this paper, we present an accurate method of detection of Alzheimer's disease using a minimal number of voxel-based morphometry features obtained from the brain MRI scans. The problem of early detection of AD is formulated as a binary classification problem and solved using an extreme learning machine classifier. The functional relationship between the voxel-based morphometry features extracted from magnetic resonance images and Alzheimer's disease is approximated closely using the extreme learning machine classifier. Since, the extreme learning machine is computationally efficient and provides a better generalization ability, Principal Component Analysis along with the Extreme Learning Machine classifier (referred to here as the PCA-ELM classifier) is used to select the minimal set of morphometric features from the brain MRI images for Alzheimer's disease detection. Performance of the PCA-ELM classifier is evaluated using the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) data set. The results are also compared with the well-known support vector machine classifier. The study results clearly show that the PCA-ELM classifier produces a better generalization performance with a minimal set of features. © 2013 Springer.},

abstract={ALuminium Fly Ash (ALFA) composites are light weight, high strength composites with good wear resistance properties. In the present investigation ALFA composites are synthesized by varying the amount of Fly ash reinforcement from 5% wt to 25% wt in the Aluminium matrix by Powder Metallurgy technique. The Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) characterization of precipitator Fly ash and the Milled Aluminium Fly ash mixture is presented in this work along with the results on green and sintered properties of the developed composite. The SEM photographs indicated a fairly uniform distribution of Fly ash in the composite; the green density is found to be decreased by 38.39% for specimen containing 25% wt of Fly ash compared to the specimen with only Aluminium. The densities of compacts sintered at 600°C were lower as compared to compacts sintered at 500°C, whereas Rockwell Hardness for compacts sintered at 550°C is found to be superior to that for compacts sintered at 600°C. For a constant temperature with increase in diameter and decrease in duration of sintering Rockwell Hardness is found to be increasing and for increasing diameters, decreasing temperatures and duration of time the Hardness keeps on increasing. © 2013 CAFET-INNOVA TECHNICAL SOCIETY.

We propose to represent a traffic video shot by an interval valued features. Unlike the conventional methods, the interval valued feature representation is able to preserve the variations existing among the extracted features of a traffic video shot. Based on the proposed symbolic representation, we present a symbolic method of classifying traffic video shots. The symbolic classification method makes use of a symbolic similarity measure for classification. An experimentation is carried out on a benchmark traffic video database. Experimental results reveal the efficacy of the proposed symbolic classification model. Moreover, it achieves classification within negligible time as it is based on a simple matching scheme.},

abstract={Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) films doped with different concentrations viz., 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 wt.% of the carbon coated zinc oxide (C-ZnO) nanoparticles were prepared by solution casting method in order to investigate the effect of C-ZnO addition on the electrical, optical, structural and morphological properties of PVA matrix. The electrical properties such as dielectric constant (ε ′ ), dielectric loss (ε), dissipation factor (Tan δ), electrical modulus (M ′ , M) and AC conductivity (σ ac ) of the PVA/C-ZnO nanocomposites have been performed with reference to weight percentage of nanofiller (i.e., 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 wt%) and frequency (20 Hz to 1 MHz). It is observed that the dielectric constant, dielectric loss, and electrical conductivity gradually decrease with filler concentration. Microstructural property of the nanocomposites is studied by using X-ray diffraction. XRD profiles demonstrated the semi crystalline nature of the composites. SEM photomicrographs of the PVA/C-ZnO nanocomposites reveal the uniform distribution of nanoparticles within the polymer matrix. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermograms of nanocomposites clearly indicates that the influence of nanofillers on their melting temperature (T m ) is insignificant. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Curdlan sulfate (CRDS), a sulfated 1→3-β-D glucan, previously shown to be a potent HIV entry inhibitor, is characterized in this study as a potent inhibitor of the Dengue virus (DENV). CRDS was identified by in silico blind docking studies to exhibit binding potential to the envelope (E) protein of the DENV. CRDS was shown to inhibit the DENV replication very efficiently in different cells in vitro. Minimal effective concentration of CRDS was as low as 0.1 μg/mL in LLC-MK2 cells, and toxicity was observed only at concentrations over 10 mg/mL. CRDS can also inhibit DENV-1, 3, and 4 efficiently. CRDS did not inhibit the replication of DENV subgenomic replicon. Time of addition experiments demonstrated that the compound not only inhibited viral infection at the host cell binding step, but also at an early post-attachment step of entry (membrane fusion). The direct binding of CRDS to DENV was suggested by an evident reduction in the viral titers after interaction of the virus with CRDS following an ultrafiltration device separation, as well as after virus adsorption to an alkyl CRDS-coated membrane filter. The electron microscopic features also showed that CRDS interacted directly with the viral envelope, and caused changes to the viral surface. CRDS also potently inhibited DENV infection in DC-SIGN expressing cells as well as the antibody-dependent enhancement of DENV-2 infection. Based on these data, a probable binding model of CRDS to DENV E protein was constructed by a flexible receptor and ligand docking study. The binding site of CRDS was predicted to be at the interface between domains II and III of E protein dimer, which is unique to this compound, and is apparently different from the β-OG binding site. Since CRDS has already been tested in humans without serious side effects, its clinical application can be considered. © 2013 Ichiyama et al.},

abstract={Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most lethal malignancies, and is also the fourth most common cancer worldwide with around 700,000 new cases each year. Currently, first line chemotherapeutic drugs used for HCC include fluorouracil, cisplatin, doxorubicin, paclitaxel and mitomycin, but most of these are non-selective cytotoxic molecules with significant side effects. Sorafenib is the only approved targeted therapy by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for HCC treatment, but patients suffer from various kinds of adverse effects, including hypertension. The signal-transducer-and-activator-of-transcription 3 (STAT3) protein, one of the members of STATs transcription factor family, has been implicated in signal transduction by different cytokines, growth factors and oncogenes. In normal cells, STAT3 activation is tightly controlled to prevent dysregulated gene transcription, whereas constitutively activated STAT3 plays an important role in tumorigenesis through the upregulation of genes involved in anti-apoptosis, proliferation and angiogenesis. Thus, pharmacologically safe and effective agents that can block STAT3 activation have the potential both for the prevention and treatment of HCC. In the present review, we discuss the possible role of STAT3 signaling cascade and its interacting partners in the initiation of HCC and also analyze the role of various STAT3 regulated genes in HCC progression, inflammation, survival, invasion and angiogenesis. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The present study has been undertaken to develop a sustained-release tablet dosage form for metoprolol succinate drug using naturally occurring ghatti gum as the rate-controlling polymer. The prepared ghatti gum tablets were evaluated for hardness, thickness, friability, weight variation and drug content. The tablets were coated with shellac as an enteric polymer coat and evaluated for tablet properties and enteric coat test. In vitro release studies for the prepared tablets were carried out for 2 hrs in pH 1.2 HCl buffer and 12 hrs in pH 7.2 phosphate buffer. Furthermore, drug interaction in ghatti gum tablet formulation was evaluated by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Swelling studies, kinetics of drug release from the matrices and stability of the tablet formulations were also investigated. From the In vitro studies, it was found that the tablets had good mechanical properties and coating with shellac has prevented drug release from stomach. The tablets have retained the drug release till a period of 12 hrs. The data obtained from Peppas model fitting indicated that F5 was optimized formulation. When stability studies were done for three months at 40±2° C and 75±5% RH for optimized formulation, it was found that the tablets showed negligible difference in release mechanism as well as drug content.},

abstract={This paper is intended to develop a new approach for identification and classification of dysfluent and normal speech using Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC). Stuttering is a fluency disorder in which the fluency of speech is interrupted by occurrences of dysfluencies such as repetitions, prolongations, interjections, silent pauses, broken words, incomplete phrases and revisions. In this work we have considered three types of dysfluencies such as repetition, prolongation and interjection to characterize stuttered speech. After obtaining dysfluent and normal speech, the speech signals are analyzed in order to extract MFCC features. The k-Nearest Neighbor(k-NN) classifier is used to classify the speech as dysfluent and normal speech. The 80% of the data is used for training and 20% for testing. The avarage accuracy of 86.67% and 93.34% is obtained for dysfluent and normal speech respectively. Copyright © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={Query by Singing (QBS) is a Music Information Retrieval (MIR) system with small audio excerpt as query. The rising availability of digital music stipulates effective music retrieval methods. Further, MIR systems support content based searching for music and requires no musical acquaintance. Current work on QBS focuses mainly on melody features such as pitch, rhythm, note etc., size of databases, response time, score matching and search algorithms. Even though a variety of QBS techniques are proposed, there is a dearth of work to analyze QBS through query excerption. Here, we present an analysis that works on QBS through query execrpt. To substantiate a series of experiments are conducted with the help of Mel-Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients (MFCC), Linear Predictive Coefficients (LPC) and Linear Predictive Cepstral Coefficients (LPCC) to portray the robustness of the knowledge representation. Proposed experiments attempt to reveal that retrieval performance as well as precision diminishes in the snail phase with the growing database size. Copyright © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={Today, with more and more computers getting connected to public accessible networks like Internet, computer systems are more and more susceptible to attacks. There is a need of effective intrusion detection systems (IDS) to protect computers from these unauthorized or malicious actions. Different soft-computing based methods have been proposed in recent years for the development of intrusion detection systems. In this paper we are proposing a contemporary approach for network intrusion detection which is significantly improvises the prediction of network intrusions. The proposed technique is a fusion of efficient data mining techniques such as Fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering, neural network (NN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The experiments and evaluations of proposed method were performed with Knowledge Discovery and Data mining (KDD) Cup 99 intrusion detection dataset and we have used sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision and F-value as the evaluation metric parameters. Our approach achieved detection accuracy of about 99.96% for DOS attacks, 99.73% for PROBE, 99.93% for R2L and 99.87% for U2R attacks. Our proposed technique yielded very good results and was compared with the other existing techniques to prove its validity. Copyright © 2012 ACM.},

The objective of the study is to explore the effect of the exhaust nature, i.e. filtered or raw, and operating conditions on the pollutant (NOx, CO and aldehydes) removal process. In this study the exhaust treatment was carried out in two stages. In the first stage, the exhaust was treated with single step PAC and in the second stage with double step PAC. To study the effect of exhaust nature, in each stage the experiments were carried out with filtered and unfiltered (raw) exhaust. Further, to study the effect of operating conditions, in each stage, the experiments were carried out at different temperatures (up to 400°C), different engine loading and flow rate. The effectiveness of the technique with regard to NOx, CO removal and byproduct reduction was discussed. Finally, a comprehensive comparison of the single step PAC and double step PAC techniques has been made and results were discussed.},

abstract={The production planning problem of flexible manufacturing system (FMS) concerns with decisions that have to be made before an FMS begins to produce parts according to a given production plan during an upcoming planning horizon. The main aspect of production planning deals with machine loading problem in which selection of a subset of jobs to be manufactured and assignment of their operations to the relevant machines are made. Such problems are not only combinatorial optimization problems, but also happen to be non-deterministic polynomial-time-hard, making it difficult to obtain satisfactory solutions using traditional optimization techniques. In this paper, an attempt has been made to address the machine loading problem with objectives of minimization of system unbalance and maximization of throughput simultaneously while satisfying the system constraints related to available machining time and tool slot designing and using a meta-hybrid heuristic technique based on genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization. The results reported in this paper demonstrate the model efficiency and examine the performance of the system with respect to measures such as throughput and system utilization. © 2012, Kumar et al; licensee Springer.},

Each term in B-tree is associated with a list of class labels of those documents which contain the term. Further the corresponding classification technique has been proposed.

However, clarity does not exist in the existing soil classification systems in classifying inorganic silts, silty sands and silty gravels that are non plastic. In order to make the unified soil classification system that is in wide usage more complete, additional group symbols are necessarily to be included that describe even the non-plastic soils also.

abstract={Computer industry has widely accepted that future performance increases must largely come from increasing the number of processing cores on a die. This has led to NoC processors. Task scheduling is one of the most challenging problems facing parallel programmers today which is known to be NP-complete. A good principle is space-sharing of cores and to schedule multiple DAGs simultaneously on NoC processor. Hence the need to find optimal number of cores for a DAG and further which region of cores on NoC, to be allotted for a DAG. In this work, a method is proposed to find near-optimal minimal block of cores for a DAG on a NoC processor. Further, a time efficient framework and three on-line block allotment policies to submitted DAGs are experimented. The objectives of the policies, is to improve the total completion time for the submitted set of DAGs, hence the throughput. The policies are experimented on a simulator and found to deliver better performance than the policies found in literature. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Character segmentation has become a crucial task for character recognition in many OCR systems. It is an important step because incorrectly segmented characters are unlikely to be recognized correctly. For segmenting a cursive scripts leads more challenging because of presence of more touching characters. Kannada is the one of the popular language in south India and also some of the letters in Kannada language are cursive in nature. In this paper, a new character segmentation algorithm for unconstrained handwritten Kannada scripts is presented. The proposed method is based on thinning, branch point and mixture models. The expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is used to learn the mixture of Gaussians. We have used a cluster mean points to estimate the direction and branch point as reference points for segmenting characters. We have experimentally evaluated our proposed method on Kannada words and it has shown encouraging result. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={The monitoring of tool wear is a most difficult task in the case of various metal-cutting processes. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) has been used to estimate or classify certain wear parameters, using continuous acquisition of signals from multi-sensor systems. Most of the research has been concentrated on the use of supervised neural network types like multi-layer perceptron (MLP), using back-propagation algorithm and Radial Basis Function (RBF) network. In this article, a new constructive learning algorithm proposed by Fritzke, namely Growing Cell Structures (GCS) has been used for tool wear estimation in face milling operations, thereby monitoring the condition of the tool. GCS generates compact network architecture in less training time and performs well on new untrained data. The performance of this network has been compared with that of another constructive learning algorithm-based neural network, namely the Resource Allocation Network (RAN). For the sake of establishing the effectiveness of GCS, results obtained have been compared with those obtained using Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP), which is a standard and widely used neural network. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={With the objective to investigate the influence of zinc oxide-cerium oxide (ZnO-Ce 2O 3) nanoparticles on the electrical properties of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), PVA/ ZnO-Ce 2O 3 nanocomposite films were prepared by solution intercalation method with different weight percentage viz., 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 wt% of ZnO-Ce 2O 3 nanoparticles. The fabricated nanocomposites were characterized by Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The effect of ZnO-Ce 2O 3 nanoparticles on the dielectric constant (ε'), dielectric loss (ε''), electric modulus (M' and M''), ac conductivity (σ ac), and dielectric loss tangent (tan δ) over a range of frequencies at room temperature of PVA nanocomposites have been studied. FTIR, XRD, and DSC analysis indicates the nature of ZnO- Ce 2O nanoparticles interaction with the PVA matrix. The morphological behavior of the nanocomposites has been performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The dielectric behaviors such as dielectric constant (ε') and dielectric loss (ε'') increases with increase in nanoparticle concentration, but decreases with increase in frequency. But, the electric modulus (M') increases with increase in frequency. Dielectric loss tangent (tan δ) decreases with increase in filler content at lower frequency, but at higher frequencies the tan δ increases with increase in nanoparticles content. AC conductivity (σ ac) of PVA/ZnO-Ce 2O 3 nanocomposites increases with increasing frequency following the universal dielectric response law. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.},

abstract={The majority of snake venom phospholipases A2 (svPLA 2s) are toxic and induce a wide spectrum of biological effects. They are cysteine-rich proteins that contain 119-134 amino acids and share similar structures and functions. About 50% of the residues are incorporated into α-helices, whereas only 10% are in β-sheets. Fourteen conserved cysteines form a network of seven disulfide bridges that stabilize the tertiary structure. They show a high degree of sequence and structural similarity, and are believed to have a common calcium-dependent catalytic mechanism. Additionally, svPLA2s display an array of biological actions that are either dependent or independent of catalysis. The PLA2s of mammalian origin also exert potent bactericidal activity by binding to anionic surfaces and enzymatic degradation of phospholipids in the target membranes, preferentially of Gram-positive species. The bactericidal activity against Gramnegatives by svPLA2 requires a synergistic action with bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI), but is equally dependent on enzymatic-based membrane degradation. Several hypotheses account for the bactericidal properties of svPLA2s, which include "fatal depolarization" of the bacterial membrane, creation of physical holes in the membrane, scrambling of normal distribution of lipids between the bilayer leaflets, and damage of critical intracellular targets after internalization of the peptide. The present review discusses several svPLA2s and derived peptides that exhibit strong bactericidal activity. The reports demonstrate that svPLA2-derived peptides have the potential to counteract microbial infections. In fact, the C-terminal cationic/hydrophobic segment (residues 115-129) of svPLA2s is bactericidal. Thus identification of the bactericidal sites in svPLA2s has potential for developing novel antimicrobials. © 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={Power Sector and its need for superior dielectric material is ever growing. In India exponential growth in the installed capacity is expected. During the 12th 5 year plan period it is expected to touch 3 GW installed capacity. Proposals are on the anvil go in for very high voltage transmission system (1200 kV) and very high voltage Director current system (HVDC) to meet the requirements of power. HVAC and HVDC systems put special demand on the dielectric material used in these power equipment. Novel polymeric nano composite system has been developed which has shown apart from good dielectric properties, good thermal conductivity characteristics. Nano fillers having 25-35 nm developed in house by combustion synthesis were used. The filler compositions were such that apart from improving the dielectric properties the thermal conductivity characteristics were improved. Inherently superior polymeric matrix based on Poly Aryl Ether Ketone was used in development of the composite dielectric. Dilectric loss Factor, Dielectric strength and Capacitance characteristics showed encouraging results. This insulation is proposed for use in power equipment as novel insulation system in place of conventionally used mineral oil and cellulosic paper based insulation. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={PVA nanocomposites containing cellulose nanocrystals and silver nanoparticles have been prepared and their properties were investigated. Even though bacterial cellulose nanocrystals (BCNC) improved the mechanical properties of hydrophilic polymers like modulus and strength, they also contributed to increased brittleness. An attempt was made to reduce the brittleness of the films by incorporating Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) along with BCNC. The AgNPs could form complexes with the hydroxyl groups of PVA and played the role of physical crosslinks, which makes them less hydrophilic and more ductile in nature. FTIR studies were used to confirm the interaction of AgNPs with PVA. The addition of AgNPs increased the elongation properties without compromising on other mechanical properties and at the same time it significantly reduced the moisture sorption also. Results of the study indicated that the combination of two different nanomaterials was highly effective in overcoming certain limitations of PVA-BCNC nanocomposites. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={India is looking at the renewable alternative sources of energy to reduce its dependence on import of crude oil. As India imports 70 % of the crude oil, the country has been greatly affected by increasing cost and uncertainty. Biodiesel fuel derived by the two step acid transesterification of mixed non-edible oils from Jatropha curcas and Pongamia (karanja) can meet the requirements of diesel fuel in the coming years. In the present study, different proportions of Methanol, Sodium hydroxide, variation of Reaction time, Sulfuric acid and Reaction Temperature were adopted in order to optimize the experimental conditions for maximum biodiesel yield. The preliminary studies revealed that biodiesel yield varied widely in the range of 75-95 % using the laboratory scale reactor. The average yield of 95 % was obtained. The fuel and chemical properties of biodiesel, namely kinematic viscosity, specific gravity, density, flash point, fire point, calorific value, pH, acid value, iodine value, sulfur content, water content, glycerin content and sulfated ash values were found to be within the limits suggested by Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS 15607: 2005).

abstract={The objective of this research article is to evaluate the physico-mechanical and tribological properties of nylon 66 and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) powder composites in the presence of graphite (Gr) particulate filler. Nylon 66 containing 2 wt% Gr powder was extruded with 5, 10, 15 and 20 wt% PTFE powder in a co-rotating twin-screw extruder. The fabricated nylon 66/Gr/PTFE composites have been evaluated for physico-mechanical properties, such as tensile behaviors, impact strength, water absorption, density and void content. The thermal characteristics of the composites have been studied by using dynamic mechanical analysis and thermogravimetric analysis. The effect of PTFE content, loads, sliding velocities and sliding distances on wear characteristics of the composites were evaluated using pin-on-disc equipment. The nylon 66/Gr/PTFE composites showed enhanced impact strength, thermal stability, wear resistance and reduced coefficient of friction. It was found that wear performance was greatly influenced by selected experimental parameters. Worn surfaces were examined with scanning electron microscopy to have better insight into the wear mechanism. It was observed that the PTFE played a main role in the tensile resistant and wear resistant properties of nylon 66 composites. © The Author(s) 2012.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a new machine vision algorithm for automatic defect detection on patterned textures with the help of texture-periodicity and the Jensen-Shannon Divergence, which is a symmetrized and smoothed version of the Kullback-Leibler Divergence. Input defective images are split into several blocks of the same size as the size of the periodic unit of the image. Based on histograms of the periodic blocks, Jensen-Shannon Divergence measures are calculated for each periodic block with respect to itself and all other periodic blocks and a dissimilarity matrix is obtained. This dissimilarity matrix is utilized to get a matrix of true-metrics, which is later subjected to Ward's hierarchical clustering to automatically identify defective and defect-free blocks. Results from experiments on real fabric images belonging to 3 major wallpaper groups, namely, pmm, p2, and p4m with defects, show that the proposed method is robust in finding fabric defects with a very high success rates without any human intervention © 2012 KIPS.},

abstract={Shrinkage limit is one of the important index properties determined in the laboratory, which has practical applications such as classification of soils based on their degree of expansivity and as a measure of volumetric stability of clayey soils in the field. The conventional method of its determination requires the use of mercury, which is a heath hazardous substance. This paper proposes and discusses the use of beads of an inert material having uniform grain size for the determination of volume of dry soil pat, which is required for calculating the shrinkage limit of the soil. The shrinkage limit values obtained from the use of uniform beads of an inert material compare very well with those obtained from the conventional mercury displacement method and are within the acceptable limits. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={The aim of the present work was to prepare floating tablets of diltiazem hydrochloride using ghatti gum as a matrix polymer. The tablet formulations were prepared by varying the concentrations of ghatti gum, sodium bicarbonate and hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose (HPMCK4M). The tablets were prepared by direct compression technique using PVP K-30 as a binder and sodium bicarbonate for development of CO2. The prepared floating matrix tablets were evaluated for tablet properties such as hardness, thickness, friability, weight variation, floating property, compatibility using DSC and FTIR, and stability studies. In vitro dissolution was carried out for 12 h in 0.1 N HCl buffer at 37 ± 0.5°C using USP basket type dissolution apparatus. It was found that, all the prepared formulations had desired floating lag time and constantly floated on dissolution medium maintaining the matrix integrity. The drug release from prepared tablets was found to decrease with increase in concentration of the polymer, ghatti gum. Also, addition of HPMCK4M has improved the floating capability of the tablets to a great extent. It may be concluded that ghatti gum can be used as a potential pharmaceutical excipient to develop floating drug delivery system.},

abstract={In any reinforced concrete construction, the load transfer between steel bar and surrounding concrete occurs because of bond. The codes of practice give importance on development length requirements for transfer of load from steel to concrete which is based upon the bond strength between them. Bond strength is the shearing stress developed at the steel-concrete interface on account of composite interaction between the two materials, contributing towards ductility aspect of structural behaviour. The bond between the steel and concrete enables the two materials to act together without slip at the serviceability limit state and serves to control the crack width and deflection. At ultimate limit state, the strength of laps and anchorages depend on bond. The bond stress in reinforced concrete member arises from the anchorage of bars and change in bar force along its length or due to varying bending moment. mobilisation of bond must be ensured under a variety of loading situations such as tension, compression and flexure. Many studies on conventional concretes (CCs) are available, but, not many investigations are reported on the bond strengths of geopolymer concrete (GPC) containing fly ash and ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) with the steel bars. The investigations conducted at CSIR-SERC reported in this paper are aimed at studying the bond strengths for GGBS based GPC having 0%, 25%, 50%, fly ash content in binder and the conventional concrete (CC). This was done using HSD bars of 12mm and 16 mm diameter at slips of 0.025mm, 0.25mm as per IS 2770. It was observed that bond strength in GPCs was approximately more than two times the design bond stress as per IS 456:2000 specified for the CCs and it increased with the decrease in fly ash content. The peak bond stress of GPC was found to be approximately four times the value given in IS 456:2000. The study demonstrates that the bond strength of GPCs could be conservatively taken to be the same as that of control concrete as permitted in the Codes of Practice for Portland cement based conventional reinforced concrete, for the design of reinforced geopolymer concretes.},

abstract={In this study, geopolymer is prepared from 'ground granulated blast furnace slag' (GGBS)-a powder from grinding the by-product of slag waste from blast furnace of steel plants. For comparison, conventional cement, Portland pozzolana cement (PPC) containing fly ash was considered. To achieve simultaneous acidic and sulphate attack, sulphuric acid is used for durability studies. The test data indicate that on exposure to 2% and 10% sulphuric acids, the losses in weight, thickness and strength of geopolymer concrete (GPC) are significantly much less than those for Portland pozzolana cement concrete (PPCC). The GPCs have inorganic polymers of alumino-silicates as binder, generally without any free lime. Therefore, GPCs resist acid attack better than free lime containing conventional concretes containing Portland cement. The binding action in GPC is through geopolymerisation of GGBS using alkaline activator solution (AAS) made of sodium hydroxide and sodium silicate solutions. The geopolymer eliminates use of Portland cement in structural concretes by utilizing the industrial by-product GGBS, thereby reducing considerably the carbon footprint measured by 'embodied energy' and 'embodied carbon', i.e., 'CO2e emission' of concrete.},

Today, opinions are expressed by web users using multimodal opinion elements like normal phrases, emoticons and short words or sms language. To capture web users opinion with multimodal opinion elements, we need dictionaries that will assist in identifying these multimodal opinion phrases. Dictionaries mentioned in literatures are less useful in identifying multi modal subjective phrases and opinion of web users.

In this paper, we propose to design a load balanced delay aware multi-path routing. It contains three phases: the multi-path construction phase, Data aggregation phase and the Data transmission phase. The sink calculates the inter-arrival delay and new data sending rate for all the paths and this information is sent as a feedback to the source such that the paths with minimum delay are chosen and the packets are distributed through these paths according to their new data sending rates. By our simulation results we show that our objectives are achieved through this method and so the multi-path routing has been enhanced. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.},

abstract={Geopolymeric Cement Concretes (GPCCs) are a new class of construction materials where the binder is geopolymer based. These concretes do not have Portland cement and the geopolymeric binding action comes from activation of silica and alumina available in minerals such as fly ash, metakaolin, and ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS), etc. The activating medium is a liquid which is highly alkaline and made from various chemicals such as sodium hydroxide, sodium silicate, sodium carbonate, etc. The most commonly used activator solution consists of sodium hydroxide and sodium silicate. Though the concentration of ions such as Na+, SiO3-2, OH- etc are important for characterisation of activation solutions, physical properties such as viscosity and densities, are easily measurable, more particularly the density testing is simple and straight forward. Therefore, density can be taken as a parameter to characterise the sodium hydroxide and sodium silicate solutions of different concentrations and their combinations. New empirical relationships between density and concentration of the activator solutions are proposed in this paper.},

abstract={The influence of silane-coated short glass fibers (SGF) on the mechanical and wear characteristics of nylon 66 composites was investigated by compounding nylon 66 with 35% SGF as well as with 2% molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2) and without MoS 2 in a co-rotating twin screw extruder. Thus the resultant material was evaluated for physico-mechanical, thermal, sliding wear, and morphological characteristics. It was found that the addition of glass fibers as well as MoS 2 has significantly improved the tensile strength, tensile modulus, and impact strength of the nylon 66. Differential scanning calorimetry analysis reveals significant changes in the crystallization behavior of nylon 66 for incorporation of fillers. Thermal stability of the nylon 66 was found to be improved as revealed by the thermogravimetric analysis results. Dynamic mechanical analysis results show drastic improvement in the storage modulus of the nylon 66 both in the glassy region as well as in the rubbery region. Wear analysis shows that the incorporation of glass fibers and MoS 2 filler has reduced the wear loss and specific wear rate of nylon 66. Worn surfaces were examined with scanning electron microscopy to have better insight of the wear mechanism. © 2012 Society of Plastics Engineers.},

McRBFN emulates human-like meta-cognitive learning principles. As each sample is presented to the network, McRBFN uses the estimated class label, the maximum hinge error and class-wise significance to address the self-regulating principles of what-to-learn, when-to-learn and how-to-learn in a meta-cognitive framework. Initially, McRBFN begins with zero hidden neurons and adds required number of neurons to approximate the decision surface. When a neuron is added, its parameters are initialized based on the sample overlapping conditions. The output weights are updated using a PBL algorithm such that the network finds the minimum point of an energy function defined by the hinge-loss error. Moreover, as samples with similar information are deleted, over-training is avoided. The PBL algorithm helps to reduce the computational effort used in training. For simulation studies, we have used well-known open access series of imaging studies data set. The performance of the PBL-McRBFN classifier is evaluated on complete morphometric features set obtained from the VBM analysis and also on reduced features sets from Independent Component Analysis (ICA). The performance evaluation study clearly indicates the superior performance of PBL-McRBFN classifier over results reported in the literature. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={A 2D Hydrodynamic-Particle Analysis model was applied to the Gulf of Kachchh (GoK) to estimate the residence time of pollutants. The tidal currents in the Gulf have a strong E-W component, which prevents the material in the north being transported towards south. In the regions situated very close to the open boundary, where the GoK waters exchange freely with the northern Arabian Sea, dilution takes place rapidly with the incoming waters and hence, the residence time is on the order of 1. day. Influence of eddies and a dynamic barrier across the Sikka-Mundra section on the residence time is apparent. Eastern GoK shows a relatively large residence time, on the order of 2-4. days, warranting caution while releasing industrial wastes in the northeastern Gulf. The region around location-5 behaves like a bay; the dissolved matter gets trapped in this bay and the residence time increases by 3-4. days. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={In this paper, we present a novel approach for the identification of brain regions responsible for Alzheimer's disease using the Magnetic Resonance (MR) images. The approach incorporates the recently developed Self-adaptive Resource Allocation Network (SRAN) for Alzheimer's disease classification using voxel-based morphometric features of MR images. SRAN classifier uses a sequential learning algorithm, employing self-adaptive thresholds to select the appropriate training samples and discard redundant samples to prevent over-training. These selected training samples are then used to evolve the network architecture efficiently. Since, the number of features extracted from the MR images is large, a feature selection scheme (to reduce the number of features needed) using an Integer-Coded Genetic Algorithm (ICGA) in conjunction with the SRAN classifier (referred to here as the ICGA-SRAN classifier) have been developed. In this study, different healthy/Alzheimer's disease patient's MR images from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies data set have been used for the performance evaluation of the proposed ICGA-SRAN classifier. We have also compared the results of the ICGA-SRAN classifier with the well-known Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) classifiers. The study results clearly show that the ICGA-SRAN classifier produces a better generalization performance with a smaller number of features, lower misclassification rate and a compact network. The ICGA-SRAN selected features clearly indicate that the variations in the gray matter volume in the parahippocampal gyrus and amygdala brain regions may be good indicators of the onset of Alzheimer's disease in normal persons. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={This paper presents a meta-cognitive learning algorithm for a single hidden layer complex-valued neural network called "Meta-cognitive Fully Complex-valued Relaxation Network (McFCRN)". McFCRN has two components: a cognitive component and a meta-cognitive component. A Fully Complex-valued Relaxation Network (FCRN) with a fully complex-valued Gaussian like activation function (. sech) in the hidden layer and an exponential activation function in the output layer forms the cognitive component. The meta-cognitive component contains a self-regulatory learning mechanism which controls the learning ability of FCRN by deciding . what-to-learn, . when-to-learn and . how-to-learn from a sequence of training data. The input parameters of cognitive components are chosen randomly and the output parameters are estimated by minimizing a logarithmic error function. The problem of explicit minimization of magnitude and phase errors in the logarithmic error function is converted to system of linear equations and output parameters of FCRN are computed analytically. McFCRN starts with zero hidden neuron and builds the number of neurons required to approximate the target function. The meta-cognitive component selects the best learning strategy for FCRN to acquire the knowledge from training data and also adapts the learning strategies to implement best human learning components. Performance studies on a function approximation and real-valued classification problems show that proposed McFCRN performs better than the existing results reported in the literature. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Similarity measures are widely used in various applications such as information retrieval, image and object recognition, text retrieval, and web data search. In this paper, we propose similarity-based methods for defect detection on patterned textures using five different similarity measures, viz., normalised histogram intersection coefficient, Bhattacharyya coefficient, Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, Jaccard coefficient and cosine-angle coefficient. Periodic blocks are extracted from each input defective image and similarity matrix is obtained based on the similarity coefficient of histogram of each periodic block with respect to itself and all other periodic blocks. Each similarity matrix is transformed into dissimilarity matrix containing true-distance metrics and Ward's hierarchical clustering is performed to discern between defective and defect-free blocks. Performance of the proposed method is evaluated for each similarity measure based on precision, recall and accuracy for various real fabric images with defects such as broken end, hole, thin bar, thick bar, netting multiple, knot, and missing pick.

abstract={In this information age, data has become one of the most important resources to organizations. The effective and efficient management of large quantities of data is a common problem found in many industries. An effective Management Information System (MIS) supplies accurate, relevant and timely information to the manager of an organization. Decision making is an important requirement in every organization, where in different types of information obtained from different functional area of management like finance, marketing, production, personal, planning and control etc. This paper discusses the acceptance and usage of Management Information System in 50 organizations consisting of 30 small scale and 20 medium to large scale organizations. The study is exclusively based on the primary data collected through a sample survey. Main emphasis was laid to understand MIS usage and problems which hinder its use. To achieve the objective of the study, the data was collected through a structured and pretested questionnaire. The analysis reveals that only 5 out of 30 small scale organizations and as many as 16 out of 20 medium to large scale organizations are found making use of MIS for supporting decision making process. To find out the possible reasons for inadequate MIS usage in organization, the respondents were requested to provide a feedback on various factors which could be possible causes for non-use of MIS in their respective organizations. In order to increase the usage of MIS in small scale organizations, there is a need to build up computer culture by properly disseminating information about potential computer applications and the benefits thereof. Such information dissemination is required to be made through various seminars/conferences/training programs etc. This in turn, increases the usage of MIS in organizations. © 2012 Pillay Engineering College.},

abstract={The effect of Co-60 gamma irradiation on l-alanine cadmium chloride (LACC), l-alanine doped potassium dihydrogen orthophosphate (KDP) and l-arginine doped KDP nonlinear optical (NLO) single crystals were studied in doses ranging from 100 krad to 6 Mrad. The crystals were grown by slow evaporation method at room temperature. The effects of gamma irradiation on the chemical, surface morphology, DC electrical conductivity, thermal and mechanical properties of the grown crystals have been studied. The functional groups of unirradiated and irradiated crystals have been identified and confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) studies. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of irradiated crystals shows some morphological changes in the crystals. The dc conductivity of LACC and l-alanine doped KDP crystals were found to increase with increase in radiation dose whereas in case of l-arginine doped KDP crystals, the dc conductivity was found to decrease with increase in radiation dose. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermograms reveals that there is no significant change in the melting point of the crystals after irradiation and the crystals does not decompose as a result of irradiation. The mechanical behavior of both unirradiated and irradiated crystals is explained with the indentation effects using Vicker's microhardness tester. The Vicker's hardness number HV and Mayer's index 'n' has been estimated and confirms that LACC belong to the hard materials. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The proposed module is implemented on FPGA and its performances are compared with parallel and pipelined DA DWT architecture. The proposed DWT logic operates at a maximum frequency of 378MHz and consumes power less than 26 mW. The memory size is reduced from 256 bytes to 16 bytes thus saving large storage space on FPGA. Functional verification of the developed system is carried out using modelsim. Simulink models for the OFDM unit are developed and performances are estimated.},

abstract={Jatropha curcas seeds contain 30-35% oil, which can be converted to high quality biodiesel. However, Jatropha oil is toxic, ascribed to the presence of phorbol esters (PEs). In this study, isolated phorbol ester rich fraction (PEEF) was used to evaluate the activity of PEs using three aquatic species based bioassays (snail (Physa fontinalis), brine shrimp (Artemeia salina), daphnia (Daphnia magna)) and microorganisms. In all the bioassays tested, increase in concentration of PEs increased mortality with an EC 50 (48h) of 0.33, 26.48 and 0.95mgL -1 PEs for snail, artemia and daphnia, respectively. The sensitivity of various microorganisms for PEs was also tested. Among the bacterial species tested, Streptococcus pyogenes and Proteus mirabilis were highly susceptible with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 215mgL -1 PEs; and Pseudomonas putida were also sensitive with MIC of 251mgL -1 PEs. Similarly, Fusarium species of fungi exhibited EC 50 of 58mgL -1 PEs, while Aspergillus niger and Curvularia lunata had EC 50 of 70mgL -1 . The snail bioassay was most sensitive with 100% snail mortality at 1μg of PEs mL -1 . In conclusion, snail bioassay could be used to monitor PEs in Jatropha derived products such as oil, biodiesel, fatty acid distillate, kernel meal, cake, glycerol or for contamination in soil or other environmental matrices. In addition, PEs with molluscicidal/antimicrobial activities could be utilized for agricultural and pharmaceutical applications. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={A two-step sequential treatment method to remove color and phenols from paper mill effluent was investigated in the present study. First step in the treatment involved chemical precipitation of effluent using ferric chloride as a precipitating agent. The chemical precipitation using 2.0 gL-1 of ferric chloride at pH 4.0 removed 99% of color, 42% of phenols, 97% of total suspended solids (TSS) and 53% of chemical oxygen demand (COD) from the effluent. However, the treatment imparted a residual concentration of 30 mgL-1 of Fe(III) ions in treated water. In second step, the effluent treated with ferric chloride was subjected to further treatment using the bacteria Pseudomonas putida. P. putida adsorbed the residual Fe(III) ions to a below dischargeable level of 1.0 mgL-1 in two days of incubation. At the end of two-step sequential treatment 99.8% of color, 98.8% of phenols, 98% of TSS and 94% of COD were reduced from the effluent. The two-step sequential treatment effectively reduced the pollutants from paper mill effluent to the disposable levels. Further, the impact of sequentially treated effluents on germination of bengal gram seeds was also studied to understand the utility value of the treated effluents in agriculture. The bengal gram seeds grown on sequentially treated effluent showed better growth with high seed vigor index and low percentage of inhibition indicating the complete removal of toxicity from effluent during the treatment. The study concludes that the proposed sequential method may be effectively used as an alternative tertiary treatment method for remediation of paper mill effluent.},

This technical note is prepared to understand the use of the Codal provisions to decide whether the given test data on samples is indicative of acceptable concrete using the criterion related to 'Individual Test Result'. A quick mathematical analysis suggests that the probability of occurrence of strength lower than that corresponding to 'Individual Test Result' criterion is not uniform for same grade of concrete with different standard deviations. This is in contrast to the characteristic strength, f ck , where the probability of occurrence of strength lower than that corresponding to f c k is always 5% (or 1 in 20) and this value is independent of standard deviation.},

abstract={The effect of ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) on mechanical and solid particle erosive wear behavior of aramid fabric reinforced-epoxy (A-E) composites has been investigated. The UHMWPE-filled aramid fabric reinforced-epoxy composites have been fabricated with varying particle concentration from 0 to 4wt% by using a vacuum assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM) technique. The erosive wear rate was evaluated at different impingement angles from 30° to 90° and at three different velocities of viz., 20, 30, and 40m/s, and at constant standoff distance. The silica sand of size 150-280μm was used as erodent. The results reveal that erosive wear rate of UHMWPE in aramid-epoxy composite exhibits lowest value as compared to unfilled A-E composites, and maximum erosion rate was observed at an impingement angle 60°, and the material behaves in a semiductile manner. The morphologies of eroded surface were examined by the scanning electron microscope (SEM) in order to establish the erosion mechanism of the composites. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={To investigate the influence of molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) as solid lubricant and filler on the polycarbonate (PC) and carbon black (CB) composites, PC containing one weight percentage of CB powder was compounded and extruded with 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 weight percentage of MoS 2 powder in a co-rotating twin screw extruder. Thus, the fabricated PC/CB/MoS 2 composites were characterized for physicomechanical properties such as density, void content, surface hardness, tensile behaviors, and impact strength. The thermal characteristics of the composites have been studied by differential scanning calorimetry and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). The effect of MoS 2 content, loads and sliding distances on wear characteristics of the composites were evaluated using pin-on-disc equipment. It was found that wear, friction, and laser etching resistance of PC/CB/MoS 2 composites increased with increase in MoS 2 content along with improvement in tensile and impact strengths. DMA analysis indicates the storage modulus of PC/CB/MoS 2 composites increased with increase in MoS 2 content below the glass transition temperature (T g ) of PC. Worn surfaces and laser etched surfaces were examined with scanning electron microscopy and optical microcopy respectively to have better insight of the wear and laser etching mechanism. It was observed that the MoS 2 as solid lubricant played major role in improving resistance to wear, friction, and laser etching. © 2012 Society of Plastics Engineers.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a method of automatic detection of texture-periodicity using superposition of distance matching functions (DMFs) followed by computation of their forward differences. The method has been specifically devised for automatically identifying row and column periodicities and thereby the size of periodic units from textile fabrics belonging to any of the 17 wallpaper groups and is a part of automatic fabric defect detection scheme being developed by us that needs periodicities along row and column directions. Overall row-DMF (or overall column-DMF) is obtained based on superposition of DMF of all rows (or columns) from the input image and its second forward difference is computed to get the overall maximum which is a direct measure of periodicity along row (or column) direction. Results from experiments on various near-regular textures demonstrate the capability of the proposed method for automatic periodicity extraction without the need of human intervention. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The FC-RBF classifier is a single hidden layer fully complex-valued neural network with a nonlinear input layer, a nonlinear hidden layer, and a linear output layer. The neurons in the input layer of the classifier employ the phase encoded transformation to map the input features from the Real domain to the Complex domain. The neurons in the hidden layer employ a fully complex-valued Gaussian-like activation function of the type of hyperbolic secant (sech). The classification ability of the classifier is first studied analytically and it is shown that the decision boundaries of the FC-RBF classifier are orthogonal to each other. Then, the performance of the FC-RBF classifier is studied experimentally using a set of real-valued benchmark problems and also a real-world problem. The study clearly indicates the superior classification ability of the FC-RBF classifier. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) confirmed the formation of rod like cellulose nanocrystals having an average diameter and length of 20 ± 5 nm and 290 ± 130 nm respectively. These nanocrystals were used to prepare gelatin nanocomposite films and characterized for elucidating its performance. The formation of percolated networks of cellulose nanocrystals within gelatin matrix resulted in improving the mechanical properties of nanocomposites. The moisture sorption and water vapor permeability (WVP) studies revealed that the addition of cellulose nanocrystals reduced the moisture affinity of gelatin, which is very favorable for edible packaging applications.

Attack by sodium sulphate is severe on P-C composites, basically due to formation of expansive salts such as gypsum and ettringite in the hydrated cement matrix. It would be interesting to know whether GPCs also get affected by these sulphates even though GPCs have geopolymer, not the C-S-H (also no free lime), as the main binding material. This aspect was studied in the investigation presented here. Test specimens of typical GPCs (GGBS based, with fly ash contents of 25 percent and 50 percent) and Portland Pozzolana Cement Concrete (PPCC) were submerged separately in 5 percent Na 2SO 4 and 5 percent MgSO 4 solutions for 90 days. The test results indicate that for 30 and 90 days exposure, there were small changes in weights, ranging from weight gain of about 2 percent to weight loss of about 2.4 percent only, there were quite different significant losses of strength in the concretes - the ranges being about 2 percent to 29 percent for GPCs as compared to 9 percent to 38 percent for PPCC depending upon the exposure time and type of sulphate. However, GPCs were found to resist sulphate attack (both magnesium and sodium based) always better than PPCC as seen from their higher residual strengths after exposure to sulphates. Eco-friendliness of GPCs were examined by computing parameters such as 'Embodied Energy' and 'Embodied Carbon' or 'Embodied CO 2 Emission', per unit volume of concrete, Energy and CO 2 emission involved to produce unit strength in concretes, etc. It was observed that GPCs were superior to PPCC in terms of these parameters also.},

abstract={Six Sigma meant for process improvement is an emerging topic among many academics and researchers for over past two decades. Very few studies have been reported about the successful applications of Six Sigma in the Indian steel industry. The purpose of this paper is providing an analysis of Six Sigma implementation at a steel manufacturer. This paper presents a case study illustrating the effective use of Six Sigma to reduce variation and improve yield for the selected grade of steel by taking the process capability into consideration and optimizing the process. This paper describes in detail how the project was selected and how the Six Sigma methodology was applied. It also shows how various tools and techniques within the Six Sigma methodology were employed to achieve substantial benefits diffusing the Innovate phase into the conventional DMAIC and modifying it as DMAI 2C.The results of the literature survey show that many of the steel industries are not aware of Six Sigma and many do not have the resources to carry out Six Sigma projects. It was also found that implementing Six Sigma with Taguchi's OA (Orthogonal Array) approach was not generally popular among Steel industries for improving the process capability. Using this approach, a substantial improvement in the values of C p and C pk were found. © International Journal of Industrial Engineering.},

abstract={The objective of present work is to investigate the effect of macroscopic graphite particles on mechanical, wear and thermal behavior of ZA-27 alloy composites. Compo casting technique was used to prepare the composites in which the graphite particles were used to reinforce ZA-27 alloy. Wear tests were conducted using pin on disc apparatus under unlubricated conditions at various load and speeds. Damping capacity, stress-strain and amplitude behaviors were studied using dynamic mechanical analyzer at various temperatures from ambient to 300 °C. Thermal conductivity and diffusivity were found using laser flash apparatus and specific heat values were found using simultaneous thermal analyzer. It was observed that the tribological property improves with the addition of graphite particle. However with observations of other parameter, it is clear that reinforcement percentage need to be optimized based on application requirement in order to have better performance and the composites can be used as structural material in various applications like bearings and thermal control functions. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In recent time conventional ways of listening to music, and methods for discovering music, such as radio broadcasts and record stores, are being replaced by personalized ways to hear and learn about music. There is abundant research and experimentation done over Western music. However, moderate amount of work noticed over Indian music and its related fields such as computational musicology and artificial intelligence to the realm of Indian music [1]. On the other hand, Indian music has adequate history and slowly it is becoming an international phenomenon. This has opened a wide opportunity for an Indian music discovery system which can suggest music based either on known artists or on simple descriptive terms. Hence researchers from various domains such as music processing, computer engineering and artificial intelligence etc. are contributing more towards Indian music processing. Eventually Indian music is broadly classified into South Indian Carnatic music and North Indian Hindustani music. Both the systems of music are rich in their own style and Carnatic music is much more complex in the way the notes are arranged and rendered [11]. Apart from these two broader categories, there are various types of Indian music. They are folk, tribal, bhajans or devotional, bhangra, Indi-pop, film songs, fusion and ghazals. This paper presents an overview of previous works on automatic Indian music information recognition, classification and retrieval. Furthermore the comparative study of the recognition, classification and retrieval techniques effectiveness based on various factors is also presented. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={The tribological and electrical properties of epoxy composites filled with nano-sized silica particles are studied and discussed in this article. To enhance the interfacial interaction between the fillers and the matrix, nanoparticles were pretreated with silane coupling agent. Dry sliding wear tests were carried out with configuration of composite sample on a rotating steel disc. Electrical measurements such as AC breakdown voltage, at 50 Hz, high voltage-low current arc resistance and wet tracking resistance were carried out. The results reveal the influence of nanosized silica loading on wear resistance of the epoxy. It is observed that 10 wt% loading of silica is very effective in reducing the wear loss. With further increase of silica filler loading, the nanoparticles agglomerated and resulted in increase of the specific wear rate. The influence of silica particles on the specific wear rate is more pronounced under sliding wear situation. The influence of silica particle loading on epoxy is evident in the results of electrical parameters like dielectric strength, arc resistance and tracking resistance. These parameters showed improvement with filler loading up to 15 wt% and beyond this value of filler loading noticeable deterioration was observed. The effects of electrical stresses in the morphologies of the surfaces of epoxy nanocomposites are discussed. © 2011 Society of Plastics Engineers.},

abstract={Defect detection is a major concern in quality control of various products in industries. This paper presents two different machine-vision based methods for detecting defects on periodically patterned textures. In the first method, input defective image is split into several blocks of size same as the size of the periodic unit of the image and chi-square histogram distances of each periodic block with respect to itself and all other periodic blocks are calculated to get a dissimilarity matrix. This dissimilarity matrix is subjected to Ward's hierarchical clustering to automatically identify defective and defect-free blocks. The second method of defect detection is based on Universal Quality Index which is a measure of loss of correlation, luminance distortion and contrast distortion between any two signals. Quality indices of a periodic block with respect to itself and all other periodic blocks are calculated to get a similarity matrix containing quality indices. Specific variances of the periodic blocks are derived from the quality index matrix through orthogonal factor model based on eigen decomposition. These variances are subjected to Ward's hierarchical clustering to automatically identify defective and defect-free blocks. Results of experiments on real fabric images with defects show that the defect detection methods based on chi-square histogram distance and universal quality index yield a success rate of 98.6% and 97.8% respectively. © de Gruyter 2011.},

abstract={This paper presents a fast learning fully complex-valued classifier to solve real-valued classification problems, called the Fast Learning Complex-valued Neural Classifier (FLCNC). The FLCNC is a single hidden layer network with a non-linear, real to complex transformed input layer, a hidden layer with a fully complex activation function and a linear output layer. The neurons in the input layer convert the real-valued input features to the Complex domain using an unique non-linear transformation. At the hidden layer, the complex-valued transformed input features are mapped onto a higher dimensional Complex plane using a fully complex-valued activation function of the type of sech. The parameters of the input and hidden neurons of the FLCNC are chosen randomly and the output parameters are estimated analytically which makes the FLCNC to perform fast classification. Moreover, the unique nonlinear input transformation and the orthogonal decision boundaries of the complex-valued neural network help the FLCNC to perform accurate classification. Performance of the FLCNC is demonstrated using a set of multi-category and binary real valued classification problems with both balanced and unbalanced data sets from the UCI machine learning repository. Performance comparison with existing complex-valued and real-valued classifiers show the superior classification performance of the FLCNC. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents a fast learning algorithm for a single hidden layer complex-valued neural network named as the "Fully Complex-valued Relaxation Network (FCRN)". FCRN employs a fully complex-valued Gaussian like activation function (sech) in the hidden layer and an exponential activation function in the output layer. FCRN estimates the minimum energy state of a logarithmic error function which represents both the magnitude and phase errors explicitly to compute the optimum output weights for randomly chosen hidden layer parameters. As the weights are computed by the inversion of a nonsingular matrix, FCRN requires lesser computational effort during training. Performance studies using a synthetic function approximation problem and a QAM equalization problem show improved approximation ability of the proposed FCRN network. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents a new approach using Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) detected features with a Self-adaptive Resource Allocation Network (SRAN) classifier for the detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. For feature reduction, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has been performed on the morphometric features obtained from the VBM analysis and these reduced features are then used as input to the SRAN classifier. In our study, the MRI volumes of 30 mild AD to moderate AD patients and 30 normal persons from the well-known Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) data set have been used. The results indicate that the SRAN classifier produces a mean testing efficiency of 91.18% with only 20 PCA reduced features whereas, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) produces a mean testing efficiency of 90.57% using 45 PCA reduced features. Also, the results show that the SRAN classifier avoids over-training by minimizing the number of samples used for training and provides a better generalization performance compared to the SVM classifier. The study clearly indicates that our proposed approach of PCA-SRAN classifier performs accurate classification of AD subjects using reduced morphometric features. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Large quantities of waste materials and by-products are generated from manufacturing processes, service industries and municipal solid wastes. As a result, solid waste management has become one of the major environmental concerns in the world. This paper presents a laboratory study to advance a step-wise procedure to proportion plain and slag concrete mixes with burnt coal cinder waste as coarse aggregate. When coarse aggregate characteristic strength is lower than the concrete strength required, conventional methods such as British Method, ACI or any standard code cannot be used directly. From the observation of failed samples, it is evident that failure of the sample is predominantly by aggregate crushing than usual bond failure observed in the case of conventional crushed aggregate. To analyze the data, concrete is regarded as composite of cement mortar matrix and coarse aggregate. With the concrete and matrix strengths and their respective volume fractions as input parameters, the characteristic strength is determined from linear law of mixtures. Using again the same law, the matrix strength required to realize higher or at par strength to that of the characteristic aggregate strength is calculated. To arrive at water-cement ratio for matrix strength the generalized Abrams' law is employed.},

abstract={Viper envenomation undeniably induces brutal local manifestations such as haemorrhage, oedema and necrosis involving massive degradation of extracellular matrix at the bitten region and many a times results in dangerous systemic haemorrhage including pulmonary shock. Snake venom metalloproteases (SVMPs) are being considered to be the primary culprits for the venom-induced haemorrhage. As a consequence, the venom researchers and medical practitioners are in deliberate quest of SVMP inhibitors. In this study, we evaluated the inhibitory effect of 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-oxo-1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-5-carbonitrile (DFD) on viper venom-induced haemorrhagic and PLA 2 activities. DFD effectively neutralized the haemorrhagic activity of the medically important viper venoms such as Echis carinatus, Echis ocelatus, Echis carinatus sochureki, Echis carinatus leakeyi and Crotalus atrox in a dose-dependent manner. The histological examinations revealed that the compound DFD effectively neutralizes the basement membrane degradation, and accumulation of inflammatory leucocytes at the site of Echis carinatus venom injection further confirms the inhibition of haemorrhagic activity. In addition, DFD dose dependently inhibited the PLA 2 activities of Crotalus atrox and E. c. leakeyi venoms. According to the docking studies, DFD binds to hydrophobic pocket of SVMP with the ki of 19.26×10 -9 (kcal/mol) without chelating Zn 2+ in the active site. It is concluded that the clinically approved inhibitors of haemorrhagins could be used as a potent first-aid agent in snakebite management. Furthermore, a high degree of structural and functional homology between SVMPs and their relatives, the MMPs, suggests that DFD analogues may find immense value in the regulation of multifactorial pathological conditions like inflammation, cancer and wound healing. © 2011 The Authors.

abstract={Chloride diffusion is one of the major reasons for causing corrosion to steel reinforcement inside concrete. Therefore, it is necessary to study concrete for its chloride ion permeability. The study presented in this paper is for the recently developed geopolymer concrete (GPC) and conventional Portland cement (P-C) based concrete. Alumino-silicates is the binder in GPC, but, in the conventional concretes, P-C is always present forming calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) gel, the main binding system. It has been found that addition of pozzolanic mineral admixture (MA) refines the matrix of hydrated P-C due to its reaction with free lime formed during cement hydration, thereby improving the penetration resistance against aggressive agents such as chlorides, sulphates, and oxygen. Therefore, most of the modern P-C based concretes contain MAs, the most common MA being the fly ash (FA), Hence, fly ash contacting P-C i.e., Portland Pozzolana Cement (PPC) was chosen in the present study to prepare specimens using Portland Pozzolana Cement Concretes (PPCCs). The chloride permeability was evaluated by following ASTM 1202. The test results indicate that the GPCs in 6 hour allowed to coulombs giving 'Low' to 'Very low' rating to the new concretes. It may be noted here that in comparison, PPCCs were rated 'very low' and the concretes with only P-C without any MA were rated 'Moderate' to 'Low' for very low w/c ratios and after prolonged curing.},

abstract={The removal of phenols from paper industry wastewater by chemical precipitation using ferric chloride was investigated in the present study. The ferric chloride was able to precipitate out phenols as well as coloring matter from the wastewater. The precipitation was found to be highly dependant on both pH and dose of iron salt used. The phenols removal was effective under highly alkaline conditions above pH 10 and the color removal was effective in the pH range of 3.0-6.0. The chemical precipitation performed at pH 12, using ferric chloride dose of 2.5 g/1, was able to reduce 98% of phenols and 80% of color from the paper industry wastewater. The experiments showed the phenols reduction from 79.5 mg/1 to a dischargeable level of 2mg/1 after treatment with ferric chloride at pH 12. The study claims that the ferric chloride can be used effectively to remove phenols from paper industry wastewater. © 2011 RASAYAN. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The anticipated diminution of fossil fuel reserves dictates the need for the utilisation of biobased resources for various applications. Until 1970 various industries have utilised biobased resources for the manufacture of a wide range of products from dyes to synthetic fibers. The replacement of petroleum derived materials by biorenewable resources and its enhanced uses have created a demand in the market. Due to increased demand and the anticipated diminution of petroleum derived materials, biorenewable resources are expected to be a major contributor for the production of industrial products. Currently various attempts have been in progress to develop the technology to reduce the costs and to improve the performance of biobased products. In the meantime, the environmental concerns are intensifying the interest in agricultural and forestry resources as alternative feedstock. The steady and sustained growth of these industries depend on the development of new markets. A potential new market for these materials is food packaging, a highly competitive area with great demands for performance and cost. © 2011 Scrivener Publishing LLC. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Rheological properties of poly (ethylene-acrylic acid) (PEA) and low density poly ethylene (LDPE) blends having varied amounts of LDPE from 0 to 100% have been evaluated at different temperatures (115, 120, and 130°C) and shear rates (61.33-613.30 s-1) using a Monsanto processability tester. A reduction in the melt viscosity of the PEA/LDPE blends was noticed with increasing the shear rate. The observed positive deviation in the experimental melt viscosities of the blends is an indication of the synergy present in the blends during melt processing. The activation energy (E a) of flow calculated using Arrhenius relation for PEA, LDPE, and their respective blends lies in the range 29.98-40.56 kJ mol-1. The experimental activation energy of flow of the blends was higher than that obtained from the additivity rule. Highest activation energy was noticed for the blends containing 60-80% by weight of LDPE in PEA/LDPE blends, which is an indication for the miscibility of the blends at these ratios. The physicomechanical properties such as density, tensile behavior, tear strength, and hardness (Shore A) of PEA, LDPE, and their blends have been evaluated as a function of varying amounts of LDPE. The obtained physicomechanical properties of the PEA/LDPE blends lie in between that of pure polymers. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The properties of the nanocomposites showed that the electrical resistivity (Ï), ultimate tensile strength, and hardness of the composites increased with SiO2 weight fraction up to 10 wt % and decreased thereafter; this suggested that the beneficial properties occurred up to this weight fraction. The temperature and seawater aging had a negative influence on Ï; that is, Ï decreased with increases in the temperature and aging.

abstract={Epoxy-based nanocomposites with 2, 5, and 7 wt% of montmorillonite (MMT) nanoclay were prepared using high shear melt mixing technique. The microstructural features of the nanocomposites were investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The thermal and mechanical properties were measured using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA), and dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA). Further, the effect of voltage, temperature, seawater aging on the electrical conductivity (ω DC) of the nanocomposites was also measured. To understand the free volume behavior upon filler loading, and to observe the connectivity between microstructure and other properties, positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy was used. The TEM results revealed that MMT nanoparticles were uniformly dispersed in the epoxy matrix. Experimental results showed that the inclusion of 2 wt% MMT nanofiller increased the Tg, electrical conductivity, thermal stability, modulus, free volume of the epoxy nanocomposite significantly. This is well explained from the results of Tg (DSC and DMA), thermal stability, TGA residue, free volume analysis, and electrical conductivity. POLYM. ENG.

abstract={Habitat fragmentation, loss of habitat and other anthropogenic activities have caused a population decline in many species, caused restriction in their distribution or even led to their local extinction. We attempted to understand the impact of such pressures on the newly identified and possibly the largest population of the endangered lion-tailed macaque, Macaca silenus in the Reserve Forests of Sirsi and Honnavara, Karnataka, using a temporal series of satellite images. Classified images showed a major increase in open area with a rapid decline in vegetation cover of about 11.5% in the wet evergreen forests over the last decade, amounting to a loss at the rate of 1.9% per year. We thus consider habitat protection and restoration of evergreen forest as the top priority along with the enforcement of conservation steps, including legal action against encroachment, extraction of timber and further fragmentation, to protect this critically important habitat of the lion-tailed macaque.},

Simulation study helps to visualize eye-diagram and Root Raised cosine (RRC) Filter with scatter plot. The error rate is calculated by comparing a transmitted data stream with a receive data stream with the help of delay introduction. Characteristic performance analysis is done by comparing the un-coded data with coded data using two different models. The Bit Error Rate (BER) curve for a Communication system illustrates the relationship between power in the transmitted signal in terms of signal to noise ratio (SNR) and the resulting BER for the system. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

Thermal characteristics were performed using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). With increase in filler loading, the enthalpy of melting (ΔHm) obtained from DSC curves was reduced as compared to pristine nylon 6. All the nanocompsoites were stable upto 205 °C.

abstract={In previous work, Coorg black pepper yellows phytoplasma (CBPYp), a 'Candidatus Phytoplasma asteris'-related strain, was identified in association with black pepper plants exhibiting yellows symptoms in southern India. In the present study, multiple gene (16S rRNA, tuf, rplV-rpsC, secY and secA) sequence analyses were carried out for finer characterisation of CBPYp isolates identified in seven plants. Nucleotide sequences of each gene studied were identical among all the CBPYp isolates here analysed. Comparison of virtual restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns, validated by actual digestion of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products, revealed that CBPYp is a member of subgroups 16SrI-B, rpI-L, tufI-B, secYI-L and secA1-A. Interestingly, alignments of nucleotide sequences with other 'Candidatus Phytoplasma asteris'-related strains revealed the presence of CBPYp-specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), located in restriction sites for endonucleases not used for conventional classification. CBPYp-specific SNPs in genes 16S rRNA, tuf and secA were detectable by virtual and actual RFLP assays, while SNPs present in rplV-rpsC and secY genes were not located in any restriction recognition site. CBPYp-specific SNPs can be used as molecular markers for the specific identification of CBPYp and for future research focused on investigating epidemiology and ecology of CBPYp in India. © 2011 The Authors.

abstract={This article gives an insight into the design considerations that have been considered to design a technical hybrid fabric structure for Radome application. An attempt has been made to study empirical relationship between various structural parameters that have a major influence on the final composite properties. The hybrid fabric structures woven out of E-glass (warp) and PEEK (weft) and E-glass (warp) and polyester (weft) have been designed based on mathematical approach and expressed in terms of geometrical parameters in order to have a complete geometric specification of the fabric. An effort has also been made to understand in a comprehensive manner the interrelationships between geometrical properties of yarns and fabrics and their influence on processing of composites and their performance. The study shows that impregnation of resin within the fiber network is primarily responsible for intimate fiber-fiber contact that contributes for the final properties in the composite and provides a good interface area in the composite. The effect of short processing cycle is also attempted keeping in view the techno-economic aspects and it is found that long process cycle with stand in time at major transition temperatures gives useful properties compared to short process cycle. Glass-polyester-based composites are also prepared and studied to have relative performance of glass-PEEK composites. © SAGE Publications 2011.},

abstract={Automatic speech recognition (ASR) has made great strides with the development of digital signal processing hardware and software. But despite of all these advances, machines can not match the performance of their human counterparts in terms of accuracy and speed, especially in case of speaker independent speech recognition. So, today significant portion of speech recognition research is focused on speaker independent speech recognition problem. Before recognition, speech processing has to be carried out to get a feature vectors of the signal. So, front end analysis plays a important role. The reasons are its wide range of applications, and limitations of available techniques of speech recognition. So, in this report we briefly discuss the different aspects of front end analysis of speech recognition including sound characteristics, feature extraction techniques, spectral representations of the speech signal etc. We have also discussed the various advantages and disadvantages of each feature extraction technique, along with the suitability of each method to particular application. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.},

Because many laboratory works in research and practice require the use of mercury, safe alternative materials and procedures are being researched. One of the Atterberg limits dealing with volume stability of soils in the field is the shrinkage limit. The conventional method followed by many national codes of practice involves the use of mercury to measure the volume of dry soil pat. This paper proposes sand replacement method to determine the shrinkage limit of soils in the laboratory. This method uses sand of uniform gradation to determine the volume of dry soil pat. The proposed method is simple, safe, free from the limitations of the conventional mercury and wax methods, and eco-friendly. The shrinkage limit values obtained from the proposed sand replacement method compare very well with those from the mercury displacement method. © 2011 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract={The objective of this work is to categorize the available fly ashes in different parts of the world into distinct groups based on its compositional attributes. Kohonen's self-organizing feature map and radial basis function networks are applied in a cascading fashion for the classification of fly ashes in terms of its chemical parameters. The basic procedure of the methodology consists of three stages: (1) apply self-organizing neural net to ascertain possible number of groups, delineate them and identify the group sensitive attributes; (2) find mean values of sensitive attributes of the elicited groups and augment them as start-up prototypes in k-means algorithm and find the refined centroids of these groups; (3) incorporate the centroids in a two layer radial basis function network and fine-tune the delineated groups and develop an indexing equation using the weights of the stabilized network. Further, to demonstrate the utility of this classification scheme, the so formed groups were correlated with their performance in High Volume Fly Ash Concrete System [HVFAC]. The categorization was found to be excellent and compares well with Canadian Standard Association's [CSA A 3000] classification scheme. © de Gruyter 2011.},

abstract={The problem of decreasing production costs through an appropriate management of available resources is fundamental in the field of industrial production. The performance of a flexible manufacturing system (FMS), not properly supported by an efficient resource management strategy, may be drastically limited, & the advantages derived from its flexibility in terms of production costs may suffer a sharp reduction. Furthermore, an FMS is composed of a large number of components, thus making the identification of a correct strategy for the management more difficult. In this paper a heuristic based genetic algorithm is proposed for generating optimized production plans in flexible manufacturing systems. The ability of the system to generate alternative plans following part-flow changes & unforeseen situations is particularly stressed (dynamic scheduling). The Key-point objective is the reduction of machine idle time obtained by an optimized evolutionary strategy needed to reach the optimal schedule in complex manufacturing systems. © 2011 Operational Research Society of India.},

abstract={Seven essential oils - Rosemary, Wintergreen, Teatree, Patchouli, Palmarosa, Geranium and Eucalyptus were used to determine the in vitro antifungal activity on Phomopsis azadirachtae. This organism is responsible for the destructive dieback disease of neem. The oils mentioned above were screened using the food poisoning technique. All the seven oils showed considerable antifungal activity against P. azadirachtae. After the conduction of the tests using the oils, the results were such that Wintergreen, Geranium and Palmarosa showed complete or 100% inhibition of mycelial growth at a concentration of 2500 ppm. Among the oils tried, Palmarosa proved to be most potent showing complete inhibition of mycelia at 500 ppm. This really suggests that plant sources possess antifungal activity and can be effectively used to treat and manage plant diseases thereby circumventing the fungal spread in our environment. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={This study is aimed at utilizing nutraceutical industrial waste and reducing carbon footprints of plastics. Eco-friendly "green composites" of high density polyethylene (HDPE) were fabricated using coleus spent (CS)-a nutraceutical industrial waste as reinforcing filler and maleic anhydride-graft-polyethylene (MA-g-PE) as compatibilizer. Composites were fabricated with 5, 10, 15, and 20% (w/w) of CS by extrusion method. The fabricated HDPE/CS composites were evaluated for mechanical and thermal behavior. A slight improvement of about 5% in tensile strength and marked improvement of about 25% in tensile modulus for 20 wt % CS filled HDPE composites was noticed. The effect of CS content on rheological behavior was also studied. Thermal characteristics were performed using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). TGA thermogram indicated increased thermal stability of CS-filled composites. From TGA curves the thermal degradation kinetic parameters of the composites have been calculated using Broido's method. The enthalpy of melting (ΔHm) obtained from DSC curves was reduced with increase in CS content in HDPE matrix, due to decrease in HDPE content in composite systems. An increase in CS loading increased the water absorption behavior of the composites slightly. Morphological behavior of cryo-fractured composites has been studied using scanning electron microscopy. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={In India, bilingual documentation is very common especially in government forms and formats, technical documents, reports, postal documents, railways reservation forms etc., Printed documents having a single Indian language often contain English words and numerals since English is considered as a link language in India. The proposed system is designed to recognize bilingual script having Malayalam and English interspersed at word-level. This problem was considered as it is more realistic. Here, a combined database approach is employed, the scripts involved are treated alike and hence a single OCR is sufficient for recognition of bilingual script. The inherent advantage of the system is that the recognition of Malayalam, English words and numerals present in a bilingual document was achieved without performing script identification initially. This method avoids the script identification process which is computationally expensive. The proposed system achieves a recognition rate of 97.5% and 98.5 % for the two feature extraction approaches respectively. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Blends of PP and SBS with and without nanoclay are prepared using twin screw extruder. The nanoclay content and SBS are varied from 1-3% and 5-15%, respectively. Effects of SBS and nanoclay content on tensile, notched impact strength, heat deflection temperature, hardness and melt flow index are studied. The DSC study shows decrease in the degree of crystallinity of PP/SBS blends with increase in SBS content up to 10% loading but shows an increasing trend at 15% loading. An attempt has been made to correlate tensile properties and various crystallization parameters such as peak crystallization temperature (Tp), onset temperature of crystallization (Tonset), initial slope of exotherm (Si), the quantity (Tc-TP), area under the exotherm (A/m) and width at half height (ΔW). We found that the stress at break, tensile modulus and yield stress have good correlation with ΔW. The yield stress and stress at break are also influenced by Xc while strain at break is better correlated to Tp which is a function of cooling rate. Yield strain seems to have strong dependency on ΔW and Xc. The role of SBS as nucleating agent for PP crystallization has been established. Incorporation of 3 phb clay to a 90/10 PP/SBS blend results in an increase in G' at 30°C. This indicates that the SBS rubber is likely to have interacted molecularly with clay particles.},

Phomopsis azadirachtae the causal organism was isolated on malt extract agar from die-back infected neem twigs. They were identified by conventional and molecular methods. Phomopsis genus specific primers (5.8S r-DNA) were then used for the confirmation of P. azadirachtae - the causative agent of die-back of neem by Polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Studies revealed the amplification of expected 141bp DNA in P. azadirachtae isolated from the diseased trees of different regions of Tamil Nadu confirming the causal organism of die-back of neem. Studies revealed a very high incidence of die-back in most of the places of Tamil Nadu.

abstract={The ever increasing demand for good sites for the engineering constructional activities necessitate many land reclamation projects involving water front areas, marginal lands and the like. These projects aim at consolidating compressible clayey soils through vertical drains. Coefficient of consolidation under radial drainage is an important input parameter in the design of any effective sand drain installation. In the present study, the solution of the governing differential equation for consolidation with radial drainage for equal vertical strain condition is represented on a semi-logarithmic plot and its characteristic features are analyzed. Some of the characteristic features observed on the theoretical curves are simulated on experimental δ-log t curves. The results of such an analysis has paved way for the development of three curve fitting procedures to determine the coefficient of consolidation under radial drainage in the initial, middle and the later stages of consolidation process. The theoretical formulations have been validated through the data from laboratory consolidation tests with radial drainage. A comparative study of the values of coefficient of consolidation under radial drainage obtained from the proposed methods and also from the methods available in the literature has also been made. J.

abstract={Nanocrystals prepared from bacterial cellulose are considered as 'green nanomaterials' depending on their renewable nature and ease of production without the involvement of hazardous chemical treatments. In this investigation, a top down approach was followed for the preparation of bacterial cellulose nanocrystals (BCNC) using a commercially available cellulase enzyme so as to retain native properties of bacterial cellulose even in its nanodimensional form. The morphological and dimensional parameters of BCNC were studied using atomic force microscope (AFM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). Thermal properties of BCNC produced using the novel enzyme treatment and conventional sulfuric acid hydrolysis were compared. The thermal stability of enzyme processed BCNC was almost two fold higher than sulfuric acid processed ones. Further, the activation energy required for decomposition of enzyme processed BCNC was much higher than the other. Using this enzyme processed BCNC, Polyvinylalcohol (PVA) nanocomposite films were prepared and characterized. Incorporation of these nanocrystals in polymer matrix resulted in a remarkable improvement in the thermal stability as well as mechanical properties of nanocomposite films. These nanocomposites exhibited higher melting temperature (Tm) and enthalpy of melting (ΔHm) than those of pure PVA, suggesting that the addition of nanocrystals modified the thermal properties of PVA. The effective load transfer from polymer chains to the BCNC resulted in an improved tensile strength from 62.5MPa to 128MPa, by the addition of just 4wt% of BCNC. Furthermore, the elastic modulus was found to increase from 2GPa to 3.4GPa. The BCNC obtained through cellulose treatment under controlled conditions were associated with several desirable properties and appear to be superior over the conventional methods of nanocrystals production. The enzymatic method followed in this study is expected to contribute the fabrication of high performance polymer nanocomposites in a much greener and innovative manner. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The antifungal activity of essential oils from clove, cedar wood, Cymbopogon species, peppermint, Eucalyptus and neem were tested for their efficacy against nine Fusarium species, namely F. verticillioides, F. proliferatum, F. oxysporum, F. anthophilum, F. pallidoroseum, F. sporotrichioides, F. solani, F. graminearum and F. lateritium, isolated from maize and sorghum. The results showed that essential oils were antifungal at concentrations of 500-2500 ppm or higher. The oil Cymbopogon nardus (referred to as citronella oil) was inhibiting all the Fusarium species growth at 500 ppm and higher. The next most potent inhibitors, the oil from C. citratus (referred to as lemongrass oil) and peppermint oils, were fully inhibitory from a concentration of 1500 and 2000 ppm and higher, respectively. Eucalyptus and neem oils were less effective in inhibiting the growth of Fusarium species tested, irrespective of their concentration. Among the seven essential oils tested against all the Fusarium species, the citronella oil showed highest inhibitory effect (minimum inhibitory concentration, MIC) at ≥ 1500, 2000, 1000, 500 ppm against F. verticillioides, F. oxysporum, F. sporotrichioides, F. lateritium mycelial growth development respectively. However clove, lemongrass oil and citronella showed highest inhibitory effect (≥ 1500 ppm) against F. proliferatum and F. pallidoroseum respectively. Further lemongrass oil showed highest inhibitory effects at ≥ 1500 and 500 ppm against F. anthophilum and F. lateritum respectively. The least MIC for F. graminearum was observed in peppermint oil at ≥ 500 ppm. The results indicate that the tested toxigenic Fusarium spp. are sensitive to the essential oils, and particularly sensitive to the citronella oil. These findings clearly indicate that essential oils should find a practical application to control the growth of Fusarium species in stored maize and sorghum grains. © Eugen Ulmer KG, Stuttgart.},

This paper outlines an approach to quantify specific relationships between cutting variables and machining parameters. The models are formulated using response surfaces methodology. The experimental data points are observed to be best fitted by non-linear quadratic models. There are three cutting variables i.e., speed, feed and depth of cut and four machining parameters namely acoustic emission (AE), tool acceleration, surface roughness and flank wear. Perturbation plots are presented. The effect of various cutting variables on machining responses is analysed from these plots.

abstract={Chi-square histogram distance is one of the distance measures that can be used to find dissimilarity between two histograms. Motivated by the fact that texture discrimination by human vision system is based on second-order statistics, we make use of histogram of grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) that is based on second-order statistics and propose a new machine vision algorithm for automatic defect detection on patterned textures. Input defective images are split into several periodic blocks and GLCMs are computed after quantising the grey levels from 0-255 to 0-63 to keep the size of GLCM compact and to reduce computation time. Dissimilarity matrix derived from chi-square distances of the GLCMs is subjected to hierarchical clustering to automatically identify defective and defect-free blocks. Effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through experiments on defective real-fabric images of two major wallpaper groups (pmm and p4m groups). © 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={The cowoven hybrid fiber fabric consisting of E-glass and poly(ether ether ketone) fiber was compression-molded to obtain the hybrid composites. The effect of heat aging at different temperatures (400Â°C and 500Â°C) for different time intervals (1, 2, and 5 min) on the microcrystalline properties of the composites has been investigated and it was observed that heat aging for short time enhances the structure property relationships as reflected in the changes in crystal size and volume. The microcrystalline parameters such as the nanocrystal size (&lt;N&gt;), lattice disorder (g), interplanar distance (dhkl), width of the crystallite size distribution, and surface-weighted crystal size (Ds) were evaluated using wide angle X-ray scattering profiles. The different asymmetric column length distribution functions namely, exponential and Reinhold distribution methods were employed to probe the microcrystalline behavior of the composites and the results were compared. The kinetics of thermal degradation (using Flynn–Wall–Ozawa) revealed that, the activation energy decreased with increase in mass loss up to 15% and remains constant thereafter. © 2010, SAGE Publications.

abstract={The extruded poly ether ether ketone (PEEK) and glass fiber yarns were used to obtain the co-weaved hybrid fiber fabrics. Compression molding technique was employed to obtain the glass—PEEK composites from the hybrid fiber fabric. Composites having different thickness values of 3.3, 3.6, and 4.5 mm have been fabricated by varying the number of layers (15, 17, and 20 layers) of co-weaved fabrics. The mechanical properties such as flexural strength and inter laminar shear strength as a function of number of layers of fabric have been evaluated. Low-velocity (2.1 m/s) repeated drop weight impact tests were carried out on the fabricated composites at 5 and 10 J incident energy. The number of drops to failure was observed to be more in 5 J compared to 10 J incident energy. Effects of frequency on the viscoelastic behavior were investigated using dynamic mechanical analyzer by sweeping at different frequency and temperature ranges. Master curves were generated by time—temperature superposition of the experimental data at a reference temperature of 156°C. The dielectric properties such as relative permittivity and loss tangent of glass—PEEK composites was found to be less dependent on the frequency (8—13 GHz) and temperature (50—300° C), which is an indication for its use in typical aerospace applications such as radomes. © 2010, The Author(s).

abstract={High Resolution images can be reconstructed from several blurred, noisy and aliased low resolution images using a computational process know as super resolution reconstruction. Super resolution reconstruction is the process of combining several low resolution images into a single higher resolution image. Super resolution reconstruction consists of registration, restoration and interpolation phases, once the Low resolution image are registered with respect to a reference frame then restoration is performed to remove the blur and noise from the images, finally the images are interpolated using adaptive interpolation. In this paper we are proposing an adaptive interpolation for super resolution reconstruction. Our proposed wavelet based restoration and interpolation preserves the edges as well as smoothens the image without introducing artifacts. The proposed algorithm avoids the application of iterative methods. It reduces the complexity of calculation and applies to large dimension low-resolution images. Experimental results show the proposed approach has succeeded in obtaining a high-resolution image with a high PSNR, ISNR ratio and a good visual quality. © 2010 IEEE.},

From the tensile behavior, it was noticed that a significant improvement in tensile strength and tensile modulus with increase in CSP filler content. It was found that the degradation of all composites takes place in two steps. Degradation kinetic parameters were obtained for the composites using Broido (BR), Coats-Redfern (CR) and Horowitz-Metzger methods (HM). The damping property reduced after the incorporation of CSP filler. Morphology of the cryo-fractured composites was studied using scanning electron microscopic technique (SEM). © (2010) Trans Tech Publications.},

abstract={A series of composites were fabricated by impregnating the jute nonwoven fabric in acrylonitrile-butadiene (NBR) latex. The effect of different weight ratio (dry to dry basis) of jute and NBR on the biodegradation of the jute-NBR composites have been evaluated. The effect of cyclic humidity on the moisture uptake behaviour of the composites have been studied as a function of NBR content. The effect of salt water immersion of jute-NBR composites at different temperatures (30, 50 and 70oC) on the mechanical properties such as tensile strength, stitch tear strength, burst strength and taber stiffness have been investigated. The biodegradation studies revealed that the percentage mass loss and percentage mass change increased with increasing the soil burial duration and reduced with increasing the NBR content in the composites. © Smithers Rapra Technology, 2010.},

The knees are among the joints most commonly affected by osteoarthritis (OA). Articular Cartilage is a hard but slippery coating on the end of each bone which forms the joint. Cartilage breaks down and wears away in OA. In this work, image processing techniques are applied on magnetic resonance images (MRI) of knee. Histogram equalization, thresholding, region of interest (ROI) processing and Canny edge detection techniques are adopted. This method segments cartilage from femur, tibia and menisci. It is semi-automatic method for visualization of knee cartilage. Quantification of cartilage thickness is carried out for normal and OA cases.

abstract={The effect of tungsten carbide (WC) particulate fillers incorporation on two-body abrasive wear behaviour of glass fabric reinforced-epoxy (GE) composites was investigated and findings are interpreted. The wear behaviour of the composites were performed using pin-on-disc tester at varying abrasive distances viz., 25,50,75 and 100 m at a constant load of 20 N. The experiment was conducted using two different water proof silicon carbide (SiC) abrasive papers and at two different velocity under multi-pass condition. The wear loss of the composites found increasing with increase in abrading distances. A significant reduction in wear loss and specific wear rates were noticed after incorporation of WC filler into GE composite. This result indicates a significant improvement in wear resistance after incorporation of WC filler. The WC loaded systems exhibit less wear of matrix during abrasion which in turn facilitates lower fiber damage, due to the presence of WC particles on the counter surface which act as a transfer layer and effective barrier to prevent large-scale fragmentation. The worn out surface features were examined through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in order to probe the wear mechanism. © (2010) Trans Tech Publications.},

abstract={Cellulose, the most widespread biopolymer, is known to occur in a wide variety of living species from the worlds of plants and microbial sources like bacteria. Bacterial cellulose produced by Gluconacetobacter xylinus in the form of long fibers can be acid hydrolyzed under controlled conditions to obtain nanocrystals. Such nanocrystals constitute a generic class of 'green' nanomaterial and have attained great importance in the field of polymer nanocomposites attributed to their superior properties. However, conventional sulfuric acid hydrolysis route provides cellulose nanocrystals with inferior mechanical and thermal properties. In this study, a hydrochloric acid (HCl) assisted top down approach has been adopted to synthesize bacterial cellulose nanocrystals, which is found to retain some of the natural properties of native cellulose even in nano-dimensions. The morphological parameters were analyzed using atomic force microscopy which confirmed the formation of nanocrystals. Using these novel nanocrystals, poly vinyl alcohol (PVA) nanocomposite films were prepared and characterized for elucidating their properties. The addition of nanocrystals has significantly improved the thermal stability and mechanical properties of PVA nanocomposites. Results of this study demonstrated that nanocrystals obtained by HCl have several advantages in the fabrication of high performance polymer nanocomposite films for food packaging applications. © (2010) Trans Tech Publications.},

The extent of reaction and average degree of polymerisation were calculated from the end group analysis of the reaction mixture withdrawn at regular intervals of time. The initial reaction rates followed the second order kinetics and thereafter deviations were observed. An appreciable degree of conversion was noticed from the extent of the reaction which lies in the range of 49. 5-62. 5%. The average degree of polymerisation calculated in the region of deviation from second order suggested the occurrence of chain branching at relatively shorter intervals along the polymer chain.

abstract={The purpose of the present study was to compare the in vitro release and to findout the bioavailability of a 75 mg indomethacin capsule (Microcid®SR - reference - product A) was equivalent to optimized formulation (indomethacin loaded microspheres - test - product B). Indomethacin (IM) loaded carnauba wax fat microspheres were prepared by using meltable emulsified dispersion cooling induced solidification technique utilizing a wetting agent. Solid, discrete, reproducible free flowing microspheres were prepared. The yield of the microspheres was up to 92%, having smooth surfaces, with free flowing and good packing properties, angle of repose, % Carr's index and tapped density values were within the limit. More than 98.0% of the isolated spherical microspheres were in the particle size range of 1135 - 1360 mm were confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The drug loaded in microspheres was stable and compatible, as confirmed by DSC and FTIR studies. A single dose, randomized, complete cross over study of IM (75 mg) microspheres was carried out on 10 healthy male and female Albino sheep's under fasting conditions. The plasma was separated and the concentrations of IM were determined by HPLC-UV method. Plasma IM concentrations and other pharmacokinetic parameters obtained were statistically analyzed. Based on this study, is it possible to conclude that drug loaded microspheres and Microcid®SR capsule are bioequivalent in terms of the rate and extent of absorption. © (2010) Trans Tech Publications.},

abstract={The effect of ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) on solid particle erosion behaviour of aramid fabric reinforced-epoxy (A-E) hybrid composites was investigated. The aramid fabric reinforced-epoxy hybrid composites have been fabricated with and with out UHMWPE filler. The solid particle erosive wear was evaluated at different impingement angles from 30° to 90° at constant velocity and at constant standoff distance. The silica sand of size 30-50 and 60-80 urn was used as erodent. The results show erosive rate of UHMWPE filled aramid-epoxy composite shows lowest value. The presence of UHMWPE in epoxy matrix gives good bonding between filler and matrix. The morphologies of eroded surface were examined by the SEM in order to establish the erosion mechanism of the composites. © (2010) Trans Tech Publications.},

abstract={The extruded poly ether ether ketone (PEEK) and glass fibre were used to obtain the co-woven hybrid fibre fabrics and converted into composites using compression moulding technique. The effect of shear stress and shear rate on the shear viscosity of PEEK was investigated to optimise the process conditions for converting hybrid fabrics into composites. The mechanical properties such as flexural strength and inter laminar shear strength (ILSS) as a function of number of layers of fabric have been evaluated. Low velocity (2.1 m/s) repeated drop weight impact tests were carried out on the fabricated composites at 5 and 10 J incident energy. Dielectric properties as a function of temperature and frequency have been carried out. Flammability behaviour of composites has been carried out using cone calorimeter. The data generated shows that glass-PEEK based composites are excellent potential materials for advanced structural composites. © (2010) Trans Tech Publications.},

abstract={Newer series of 9-ethyl-9H-purine derivatives (EPD) were synthesized and screened for their efficacy in inhibiting the proliferation of various tumor cells in vitro. We evaluated the effects of EPD against HeLa, SiHa, CaSki (human cervical cancer cells), LM8, LM8G7 (murine osteosarcoma cells), OVSAHO and SKOV-3 (human ovarian cancer cells). The chemical structures of the EPD were confirmed by 1H NMR and LCMS analyses. The inhibitory effects of EPD were studied by using trypan blue exclusion, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5- diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and TetraColor One reagents. Furthermore, SAR studies revealed that the presence of trifluoromethoxy and trifluromethyl group in 4b and 4g, respectively are responsible for the significant activity of the EPD against cervical cancer cells and the presence of isopropoxy group in 4f has influence in inhibiting the proliferation of osteosarcoma and ovarian cancer cell types.

abstract={High performance polymer nanocomposites are emerging as a new class of materials for its demanding applications as insulating material. The outstanding properties of nanoclay make them an attractive candidate for preparing advanced composite materials with multi functional features for electrical and electronics applications. A series of nanoclay incorporated epoxy and polypropylene/nylon66 (50/50 blend) nanocomposites have been prepared via chemical and melt mixing methods respectively. The fabricated nanocomposites have been characterized for dielectric behaviors such as dielectric constant (εr) and dissipation factor (tan δ). The effect of filler content, frequency, temperature and sea water ageing on dielectric behavior of nanocomposites has been investigated. The variation in the diffusion coefficient (D) of the material aged in water at different temperature with different percentage of nanoclay loaded epoxy and PP/nylon66 nanocomposites were calculated. It is observed that at increase in ageing temperature relatively increases the diffusion coefficient of the material. The measured dielectric results of the nanocomposites reveals that a significant influence of frequency and sea water ageing and marginal change with temperature.

abstract={Nano-sized SiO2 particles were filled with epoxy matrix to prepare the nanocomposites. Nanocomposites were prepared by sol-gel technique. The effects of SiO2content between 5-20 wt% were investigated, based on densification, microstructure, mechanical and electrical properties. The SiO2-Epoxy nanocomposites by the SiO2 content below 10 wt% exhibited excellent relative density over 3.8% with well dispersed SiO 2. However, the SiO2-Epoxy nanocomposites containing SiO2 of 15 wt% and above possessed a relative density of 21.5%, accompanying SiO2 agglomerated and many pores located inside the agglomerates. The tensile strength gradually increased with the increase of SiO2 content up to 10 wt% and further increase of SiO2 decreased the tensile strength. However, the tensile modulus increased with increase in SiO2 content. SiO2 filler in epoxy influenced strongly the volume and surface resistivity. On the other hand, in samples containing more than 10 wt% of SiO2 in epoxy electrical volume resistivity showed a minimum. This decrease may be attributed to SiO 2particles have large amount of -OH impurities might have been adhered into the epoxy matrix.

abstract={The purpose of this research study was to formulate transdermal film loaded with Aceclofenac (ACF) by solution casting method using chemically modified locust bean gum (MLBG) and sodium alginate (SA) in various proportions and examines the influences of various process parameters like drug: polymer ratio, concentration of plasticizer (glycerol) and permeation enhancer (menthol) on physicochemical properties of drug loaded transdermal film and drug release potential. An in-vitro skin permeation study of optimized formulation was studied. Carrageenen induced rat paw edema model was used to investigate their in vivo performance. The drug content uniformity of the prepared films lies in the range of 1.90 to1.95 mg/cm2. Increased ratio of MLBG and decreased ratio of SA showed decreased tensile strength with increased % elongation. The thickness of the films varied from 0.29 to 0.38 mm due to increased MLGB and decreased ratio of SA. Folding endurance decreases as the MLGB concentration increases with decreased SA ratio. ACF was found to be compatible and stable with the prepared formulation as confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) studies. In-vitro skin permeation studies showed a controlled release for 24h. Skin irritation test reveals no signs of erythema, edema or ulceration. The study results suggest that polymer based prepared transdermal films are potential vehicle to achieve controlled transdermal delivery of ACF for effective therapy and showed good skin tolerability.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose modifications to Kohonen's Self-Organising Feature Map (SOFM) to achieve faster convergence specifically with respect to multispectral images. First, the raw image is pre-processed using data reduction technique to obtain reduced data set and then Condensed Nearest Neighbour (CNN) rule is applied to yield standard subset of samples. The samples in the standard subset are used to find the Best Matching Unit (BMU) and the samples in the reduced data set are used to update BMU and its neighbouring neurons. The SOFM is tested on • Synthetic image data set and • Harangi 1991, 1992 image data sets. Results are compared with conventional SOFM. Copyright © 2010 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={An investigation was made to evaluate the effect of the incorporation of jatropha oil cake (JOC) alone and in combination with silicon carbide (SiC) on the mechanical and tribological wear behaviour of glass fabric-epoxy (GE) composites. A vacuum-assisted resin transfer moulding (VARTM) technique was employed to obtain a series of GE composites containing different fillers viz., silicon carbide, jatropha oil cake and a mixture of SiC and JOC. The effect of different loads (22 and 32 N) and abrading distances from 135 to 540 m on the performance of the wear resistance of the composites were measured. The mechanical properties such as tensile behaviour and hardness of the composites were evaluated. A linear relationship was found between the wear volume loss and the abrading distances. The JOC filled GE composite exhibited a lower specific wear rate by 6 and 10% at 540 m abrading distance for a load of 22 and 32 N, respectively, as compared to that of unfilled GE composites.

A series of PU/MMT nanocomposites have been prepared by incorporating varying amounts of nanoclay viz., 1, 3, 5 and 6 wt %. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the PU/MMT nanocomposites has been performed in order to establish the thermal stability and their mode of thermal degradation. The TGA thermograms exhibited the fact that nanocomposites have a higher decomposition temperature in comparison with the pristine PU. It was found that the thermal degradation of all PU nanocomposites takes place in three steps. All the nanocomposites were stable up to 205°C. Degradation kinetic parameters of the composites have been calculated for each step of the thermal degradation processes using three mathematical models namely, Horowitz-Metzger, Coats-Redfern and Broido's methods. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Poly ether ether ketone (PEEK) polymer was extruded into filaments and cowoven into unidirectional hybrid fabric with glass as reinforcement fiber. The hybrid fabrics were then converted into laminates and their properties with special reference to crystallization behavior has been studied. The composite laminates have been evaluated for mechanical properties, such as tensile strength, interlaminar shear strength (ILSS), and flexural strength. The thermal behavior of the composite laminates were analyzed using differential scanning calorimeter, thermogravimetric analyzer, dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA), and thermomechanical analyzer (TMA). The exposure of the fabricated composite laminates to high temperature (400 and 500°C) using radiant heat source resulted in an improvement in the crystallanity. The morphological behavior and PEEK resin distribution in the composite laminates were confirmed using scanning electron microscope (SEM) and nondestructive testing (NDT). Although DMA results showed a loss in modulus above glass transition temperature (Tg), a fair retention in properties was noticed up to 300°C. The ability of the composite laminates to undergo positive thermal expansion as confirmed through TMA suggests the potential application of glass- PEEK composites in aerospace sector. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The molecular transport of a series of organic probe molecules through CEPU membranes had been studied in the temperature range (298 to 333) K using the sorption-gravimetric method. The coefficients of sorption S, diffusion D, and permeation P have been calculated for CEPU-aromatic penetrants. The sorption and diffusion results measured at different temperatures, namely, (298 to 333) K, are found to follow Ficks Law. The transport data are affected by the nature of the interacting probe molecule rather than its size and also by the structural variations of the polymer membrane. It was found that the penetrant of the comparable solubility parameter with CEPU interact more and thus there is an increase in sorption. In all of the liquid penetrants, the transport phenomenon was found to follow the Fickian mode of transport. From the temperature dependence of diffusion and permeation coefficients, the Arrhenius activation parameters, such as the activation energy for diffusion, ED, and permeation, EP, processes, have been estimated. Furthermore, the sorption results have been interpreted in terms of thermodynamic parameters such as the change in enthalpy, ΔH. © 2010 American Chemical Society.},

The simulations of developed dyadic wavelet based architecture and its learning algorithm justifies the effectiveness of the scaling function characteristics.

Incorporation of fly ash, cenospheres, and calcium aluminosilicate improved the thermal properties of the composites due to increased Tg of the composites as revealed by the DSC data. Also, it was observed that the mechanical properties of calcium aluminosilicate filled composites improved more compared to fly ash and cenospheres filled composites. We attribute these favorable changes to the higher silica content of calcium aluminosilicate on account of possible interactions between the polymer matrix and silica and to some extent from particulate size. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={The skin is considered a complex organ for drug delivery because of its structure. Drug delivery systems are designed for the controlled release of drugs through the skin into the systemic circulation, maintaining consistent efficacy and reducing the dose of the drugs and their related side effects. Transdermal drug delivery represents one of the most rapidly advancing areas of novel drug delivery. The excellent impervious nature of the skin is the greatest challenge that must be overcome for successful drug delivery. Today, polymers have been proven to be successful for long-term drug delivery applications as no single polymer can satisfy all of the requirements. Biopolymers in the field of dermal application are rare and the mechanisms that affect skin absorption are almost unknown. Biopolymers are widely used as drug delivery systems, but as such the use of biopolymers as drug delivery systems in dermatologic therapy is still in progress. Commonly used biopolymers include hydrocolloids, alginates, hydrogels, polyurethane, collagen, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid), chitosan, proteins and peptides, pectin, siRNAs, and hyaluronic acid. These new and exciting methods for drug delivery are already increasing the number and quality of dermal and transdermal therapies. This article reviews current research on biopolymers and focuses on their potential as drug carriers, particularly in relation to the dermatologic aspects of their use. © 2010 by Begell House, Inc.},

abstract={In this paper we present a novel wavelet based forecast model integrating wavelet filters for denoising and Improved Instance based learning approach. The proposed model implements a novel technique that extends the nearest neighbor algorithm to include the concept of pattern matching so as to identify similar instances thus implementing a nonparametric regression approach. A hybrid distance measure combining correlation and euclidean distance to select similar instances has been proposed. To illustrate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed model simulations using Mackey-Glass benchmark series and a real time Nord pool time series used in day-ahead forecast of electricity prices have been carried out. We apply a comprehensive set of non redundant orthogonal wavelet transforms for individual wavelet subband to denoise the signal. The analysis of simulations demonstrate that the proposed wavelet based - IIBL model results in accurate predictions and encouraging results for both the series. Copyright 2010 ACM.},

abstract={A wide variety of biometrics based tools are under development to meet the challenges in security in the existing complex scenario. Among these, iris pattern based identification is the most promising for its stability, reliability, uniqueness, noninvasiveness and immunity from duplication. Hence the iris identification technique has become hot research point in the past several years. This paper compares recognition rates, speed and other efficiency parameters resulting from three iris feature extraction algorithms that use statistical measures, lifting wavelet transform (LWT), and Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) respectively. Experimental results show that while LWT provides higher recognition rate, GLCM approach offers reduction in computation time with a small compromise in recognition rate. It also demonstrates that statistical measures is the most economical when recognition requirement is crucial. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Iris feature extraction is the crucial stage of the whole iris recognition process. Through analyzing iris feature extraction and matching method, iris features are not consistent because most feature extraction techniques are sensitive to the variations of captured image data. In this paper we use the Scale Invariant Feature Transformation (SIFT) for recognition using iris images which is invariant to image scaling and rotation. We extract the characteristic SIFT feature points which shows the higher feasibility in the iris feature extraction and matching process. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Hybrid nanocomposites of polypropylene/ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (PP/UHMWPE, 70/30) with various amounts of carbon black (CB) and carboxylated multiwalled carbon nanotubes (c-MWNTs) were prepared by the solution mixing and melt blending techniques. The effects of the mixture of CB and c-MWNTs on the positive-temperature-coefficient (PTC) behavior and the negative-temperature-coefficient (NTC) behavior, as well as the room temperature resistivity, were studied. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images showed that the CB particles were aggregated at the interface, between PP and UHMWPE. This selective localization of the CB particles at the interface along with the formation of continuous conducting media leads to the formation of additional conducting networks, resulting in a percolation threshold at a low CB content. A synergy effect of the hybrid conducting fillers of CB and c-MWNTs on the PTC behavior of the hybrid blends was also observed. The room temperature resistivity was reduced significantly by the incorporation of the c-MWNTs into the PP/UHMWPE/CB composite. The intensity and repeatability of the PTC effect in the nanocomposites were improved and the NTC effect weakened by incorporating a small amount (0.5 wt %) of c-MWNTs. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={A series of HDPE/MMT nanocomposites with different proportions of compatibilizers, PE-g-MAH (AC573A and 5TP409/E) were prepared in a counter rotating twin screw extruder. The effect of nanoclay loading, compatibilizer type and amount was examined. The work was carried out using a specific grade of HDPE recommended for blow-moulding applications and modification of the same by blending with selected polymer and nanofiller to achieve the desired properties. The composition containing higher percentage of nanoclay showed improvement in mechanical properties. About 17% in tensile modulus and about 20% increase in flexural modulus were observed with high-viscous compatibilizer. The dispersion behaviour of nanoclay in PE matrix was studied using X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. It was clear from WXRD that in all nanocomposite samples, the peaks were shifted to lower 2θ values implying that the d-spacing increases and that intercalation occurred. Low molecular weight compatibilizer PE-g-MA resulted in better intercalation than high molecular weight compatibilizer. It was observed that in the case of 5% AC573A loading, there was slight decrease in d-spacing value which indicated that some exfoliation also occurred in nanocomposite. Nanocomposite containing PE-g-MAH is higher concentration gives better dispersion than at low concentration. TEM results show that PE-g-MAH (AC573A) at 5% loading is more efficient as compatibilizer (not many aggregates seen) than other compositions. © 2010 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.},

abstract={Fly ash Cenospheres was used as reinforcing filler in High density polyethylene (HDPE) to develop lightweight composites. Cenospheres are inert hollow silicate spheres. Cenospheres are a naturally occurring by-product of the burning process at coal-fired power plants, and they have most of the same properties as manufactured hollow-sphere products. Cenospheres are primarily used to reduce the weight of plastics, rubbers, resins, cements, etc. used extensively as filler lubricants in oil drilling operations under high heat and high stress conditions down the hole. Also used as oil well cementing, mud putty and similar applications. Cenospheres were first used in the United States as an extender for plastic compounds, as they are compatible with plastisols thermoplastics, Latex, Polyesters, Epoxies, Phenolic resins and urethanes. The compatibility of Cenospheres with special cements and adhesives coating and composites have been well identified. Cenospheres are widely used in a variety of products, including sports equipments, insulation, automobile bodies, marine craft bodies, paints, and fire and heat protection devices. Typically applied in gypsum board jointing compounds, veneering plasters, stuccos, sealants, coating and cast resins. Providing the advantages of reduces weight, increased filler loadings, better flow characteristics, less shrinkage and warping and reduces water absorption. In order to improve the interaction between the inorganic filler and the organic matrix, the Cenospheres were surface treated with silane coupling agent and HDPE-g-dibutyl maleate was used as compatibilizer. The tensile and thermal properties of the composites were measured according to ASTM methods. The results reveal that, both surface modification of Cenospheres accompanied by compatibilization led to the substantial improvement to mechanical properties and thermal stability of the composites. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The biobased chain extended polyurethane (PU) was synthesized by reacting castor oil based polyol with different diisocyanates [toluene-2,4-diisocyanate (TDI) and hexamethylene diisocyanate (HMDI)] and chain extender such as glutaric acid. Biocomposites have been fabricated by incorporating the silk fiber into both TDIand HMDI-based PUs. The effect of incorporation of silk fiber into TDI- and HMDI-based neat PU on the physicomechanical properties such as density, surface hardness, tensile strength, and percentage elongation have been investigated. The dynamic mechanical properties and the thermal stability of neat PUs and the silk fiber incorporated PU composites have been evaluated. The TDI-based neat PU has showed higher mechanical properties compared to HMDI-based PU. The incorporation of 10% silk fiber into TDI- and HMDIbased PU resulted in an enhancement of tensile strength by 1.8 and 2.2 folds, respectively. The incorporation of silk fiber into biobased chain extended PU increased the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the resultant biocomposites. The morphology of tensile fractured neat PUs and their biocomposites with silk fiber was studied using scanning electron microscope (SEM). POLYM. ENG.

abstract={Electrochemical (EC) oxidation of distillery wastewater with low (BOD 5/COD) ratio was investigated using aluminum plates as electrodes. The effects of operating parameters such as pH, electrolysis duration, and current density on COD removal were studied. At a current density of 0.03 A cm-2 and at pH 3, the COD removal was found to be 72.3%. The BOD 5/COD ratio increased from 0.15 to 0.68 for an optimum of 120-min electrolysis duration indicating improvement of biodegradability of wastewater. The maximum anodic efficiency observed was 21.58 kg COD h-1A -1m-2, and the minimum energy consumption observed was 0.084 kWh kg-1 COD. The kinetic study results revealed that reaction rate (k) decreased from 0.011 to 0.0063 min-1 with increase in pH from 3 to 9 while the k value increased from 0.0035 to 0.0102 min-1 with increase in current density from 0.01 to 0.03 A cm-2. This study showed that the COD reduction is more influenced by the current density. The linear and the nonlinear regression models reveal that the COD reduction is influenced by the applied current density. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={The biobased chain extended polyurethane (PU) was obtained by reacting castor oil based polyol with toluene-2,4-diisocyanate (TDI) and chain extender such as glutaric acid. The effect of incorporation of chain extender into PU on the molecular transport of substituted aromatic solvent penetrants (benzene, chlorobenzene and nitrobenzene) was studied in comparison with a neat PU. Sorption (S) studies were carried out at different temperatures viz., 25, 40 and 60°C. From the sorption results, the diffusion (D) and permeation (P) coefficients of penetrants have been calculated. A significant increase in the diffusion and permeation coefficients were observed with an increase in the temperature of the sorption experiments. Higher values of diffusion and permeation coefficients were noticed for chain extended PUs as compared to PU. Attempts were made to estimate the empirical parameters like n, which suggests the mode of transport and K is a constant depends on the structural characteristics of the composite in addition to its interaction with penetrants. The temperature dependence of the transport coefficients has been used to estimate the activation energy parameters for diffusion (ED) and permeation (Ep) processes from Arrhenius plots.},

abstract={Iris recognition a new biometric technology has great advantages such as variability, stability and security. In this paper we propose a feature extraction method for iris recognition based on contourlet transform. Contourlet transform captures the intrinsic geometrical structures of iris image. It decomposes the iris image into a set of directional subbands with texture details captured in different orientations at various scales. Discriminant analysis is used to determine the optimal threshold for the selection of dominant directional energy components. Only dominant directional energy components are employed as elements of the input feature vector. These input feature vectors are compared with the template feature vectors. Experimental results show that the proposed method reduce processing time and increase the classification accuracy and outperforms the wavelet based method. © 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

The free volume data from positron results showed minimum free volume at 5 wt% of PEI after 60 s of irradiation due to cross linking through hydrogen bond formation and possible estrification among the blend components.

Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) are comprised of several concentric cylinders of graphite sheets, with an approximately 3.4 Å spacing between layers. MWNTs usually have a diameter in the order of 2-100 nm (typically 2-10 nm in internal diameter), which is slightly larger than that of a single layer cylindrical graphite sheet of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs), which is approximately 0.2-2 nm in diameter.

abstract={Polymer-Zeolites composites have been prepared, using castor oil based polyurethane (PU) as a host and AlPO4-5 as particulate filler. The prepared PU/zeolite composites have been characterized for mechanical properties such as tensile strength and tensile modulus. These PU composites exhibited an improved mechanical performance compared to the unfilled PU. Thermo gravimetric analyzer (TGA) curve shows that all the chain-extended PUs are stable up to 250 °C and maximum weight loss occurs at 490 °C. The thermal stability of composites increases with increase in zeolite content. Microcrystalline parameters and micro voids of composites have been measured by using wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) and Positron Annihilation Lifetime (PALS) methods respectively. The microcrystalline parameters and micro-voids from PALS indicate the interaction of the filler with the matrix is stronger beyond 5% of the filler which reflect the mechanical performance as well. Surface morphology of composites has been studied using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The photomicrograph of SEM indicates a uniform distribution of zeolite filler in the PU matrix.},

The main idea is based on the fact that the average DC value of a signal is proportional to its Duty Cycle. So, if we assure that a signal and its inverted counterpart have equal average DC value, that particular signal will have a 50% duty cycle. A feedback circuit is used to compare the average DC values and correct the duty cycle of the signal. The duty correction circuit was implemented in 130nm technology with a power supply of 1.2V. It was found by simulation that the circuit gives nearly 50% duty cycle at the output for a 500MHz signal when the input duty cycle is varied from 25% to 75%. © 2009 by Department of Microelectronics & Computer Science.},

abstract={RBF networks are conventionally trained using two mutually exclusive stages - the unsupervised first stage to fix the position of the Gaussian kernels and their widths and the supervised second stage to learn the weight vector. In literature many works are devoted to the estimation of the position of Gaussian kernels as well the computation of weights. Little focus exists on the estimation of kernel widths. Constructive learning algorithms provide a unified one stage approach for generating RBF network architectures. Positioning RBF kernels at optimal locations and appropriately fixing their widths in such networks differ from those in conventional networks. In this paper we investigate the use of different statistical measures to calculate the widths of RBF kernels and integrate them into our adaptive learning algorithm. Experimental results are presented on different benchmark datasets. Copyright © 2009 by IICAI.},

abstract={The sources of groundwater pollution such as, industrial effluents, sewage and extensive farming have lead to agrochemical pollution. Mathematical modeling helps to analyze the existing situation, allows forecasting, and to evaluate the effects of changes in the surrounding water quality. The present research has been focused mainly towards understanding the various processes affecting the transport of chemicals in soils. Dispersion coefficient for the sandy loam soil was found to be 0.247 m2/d, 0.150 m2/d and 0.01 m2/d for nitrates, phosphates and Chlorpyriphos through column, and 0.337 m2/d, 0.217 m2/d and 0.077 m2/d for nitrates, phosphates and Chlorpyriphos through channel studies, respectively. For similar analysis of the breakthrough curves, dispersion coefficient for the clay soil was found to be 0.0835 m2/d, 0.0632 m2/d and 0.008 m2/d for nitrates, phosphates and Chlorpyriphos through column and 0.147 m2/d, 0.0848m2/d and 0.022 m2/d for nitrates, phosphates and Chlorpyriphos through channel studies, respectively. The one-dimensional analytical model has been used and validated with the experimental data obtained from column and channel studies in sandy loam and clay soils and compared with model output (in which total elimination rate "K" is considered as zero). From this a variation of about 40-60 percent in the leaching characteristics of pollutants was being observed (nitrates, phosphates and chlorpyriphos).},

abstract={Iris recognition is one of the most reliable biometric technologies. The performance of an iris recognition system can be undermined by poor quality images and result in high false reject rates (FRR) and failure to enroll (FTE) rates. The selection of the features subset and the classification has become an important issue in the field of iris recognition. In this paper, a wavelet-based quality measure for iris images is proposed. The proposed method includes three modules: image preprocessing, feature extraction and recognition modules. The feature extraction module adopts the wavelet transform as the discriminating features. Similarity between two iris images is estimated using Euclidean distance measures. Features extracted using higher level wavelet decompositions are shown to yield better clustering and higher success rate in recognition. © 2009 IEEE.},

The model presented here consists of two stages. In the first stage, a huge database of 450 mix designs garnered through standard research publications were statistically analyzed to elicit upper and lower bounds of certain range constraints and rational ratio constraints of functional parameters. In the second stage, PSO is applied to find the quantities of cement, fly ash, and water for maximized strength of the mix. Optimal mix proportions of these important ingredients are computed corresponding to five ranges of 28 days strength by augmenting the algorithm with appropriate constraint ranges obtained in the first stage. The optimized proportions of ingredients in all the five cases are encouraging and corroborate very well with the experimental results. The outcome of this work is useful in reducing the number of trial mixtures with desired properties in the field tests. Copyright © 2009 by IICAI.},

abstract={Due to the factors like processing power limitations and channel capabilities images are often down sampled and transmitted at low bit rates resulting in a low resolution compressed image. High resolution images can be reconstructed from several blurred, noisy and down sampled low resolution images using a computational process know as super resolution reconstruction. The problem of recovering a high resolution image from a sequence of low resolution compressed images is considered. In this paper, we propose lifting schemes for intentionally introducing down sampling of the high resolution image sequence before compression and then utilize super resolution techniques for generating a high resolution image at the decoder. Lifting wavelet transform has its advantages over the ordinary wavelet transform by way of reduction in memory required for its implementation. This is possible because lifting transform uses in-place computation. The lifting coefficients replace the image samples present in the respective memory locations. In our proposed approach the forward lifting is applied to the high resolution images which are compressed using Set Portioning in Hierarchical Trees (SPHIT), the compressed images are transmitted which results in low resolution images at the encoder, at the decoder super resolution techniques are applied; lifting scheme based fusion is performed, then decoded using DSPIHT and Inverse lifting is applied. In order to remove noise from the reconstructed image soft thresholding is performed and the blur is removed using blind deconvolution, and finally interpolated using our novel interpolation technique. We have performed both objective and subjective analysis of the reconstructed image, and the resultant image has better super resolution factor, and a higher ISNR and PSNR. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={In electrical and communication systems, thermosets are considered one of the most important classes of dielectric materials. The addition of nanofiller to such materials enhances the electrical properties. Nano-filler additions to thermoset polymers restrict the chain movement in the frequency range of 10 -1 to 102 Hz. The measurement in such cases is done using low frequency dielectric spectroscopy. This paper presents the low frequency behavior of nanosized alumina filled epoxy composites in terms of capacitance and tan δ measurements. The results indicate that the tan δ, real and imaginary capacitance values decrease with increase in the frequency. A theoretical model for capacitance has been developed for comparison. It is found that a good correlation exists in respect of capacitance value measured with that of the theoretical ones. ©2009 IEEE.},

abstract={Mechanical properties and three-body abrasive wear behavior of 5 and 10% w/w bio-based coleus spent (CS) filled and unfilled semi interpenetrating polymer network composites of unsaturated polyester/polymethyl methacrylate (80/20) have been studied. The tensile strength and elongation at break has been evaluated using 4302 Hounsfield Universal testing machine. The effect of abrading distances viz., 150, 300, 450, and 600 m and different loads of 22 and 32 N at 200 rpm on the abrasive wear behavior have been studied using dry sand/rubber wheel abrasive test rig. The CS filler lowered the mechanical properties and improved abrasion resistance of USP/PMMA SIPN. The tensile strength of the composites lies in the range of 25.0-33.1 MPa. The wear volume loss and specific wear rate as a function of abrading distance and load were determined. The wear volume loss increases with increased abrading distance/load for all composites tested. However, the specific wear rate decreased with an increase in abrading distance/load. CS filled USP/PMMA SIPN composites showed better abrasion wear resistance as compared to unfilled USP/PMMA SIPN. The worn surface features have been examined using scanning electron microscope. Also, the wear volume loss was correlated with the product of tensile strength and elongation at break. © 2009 SAGE Publications.},

In this paper we propose two methods for characterization one based on computation of marginal frequencies and the other uses dominant singular values as distinct characteristic features.

abstract={Wear mechanism of a cutting tool is highly complex in that the processes of tool wear results from interacting effect of machining configurations. Various output generated by the study and analysis of each tool is extremely useful in analyzing the tool characteristics in general and to make efforts to obtain the estimated tool life in particular. The gradual process of tool wear has adverse influence on the quality of the surface generated and on the design specifications in the work piece dimensions and geometry, and causes, at the worst case, machine breakdown. Advanced manufacturing demands proper use of the right tool and emphasizes the need to check the wear rate. A scientific method of obtaining conditions for an optimal machining process with proper tools and control of machining parameters is essential in the present day manufacturing processes. Many problems that affect optimization are related to the diminished machine performance caused by worn out tools. One of the indirect methods of tool wear analysis and monitoring is based on the acoustic emission (AE) signals. The generation of the AE signals directly in the cutting zone makes them very sensitive to changes in the cutting process and provides a means of evaluating the wear of cutting tools. Wear parameters obtained in the process are analyzed with the output generated by using Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) based back propagation technique and Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Interference System (ANFIS). The results obtained from these methods are correlated for the actual and predicted wear. Experiments have been conducted on ENS and, EN24 using Uncoated Carbide, Coated carbide and Ceramic inserts (Kennametal, India make) on a high speed lathe for the most appropriate cutting conditions. The AE signal analysis (considering signal parameters such as, ring down count (RDC), rise time (RTT), event duration (ED)and energy (EG). Flank wear in tools and corresponding cutting forces for each of the trials are measured and are correlated for various combinations of tools and materials of work piece. Copyright © 2008 by ASME.},

abstract={In this experimental study, the dry sliding wear and two-body abrasive wear behaviour of graphite filled carbon fabric reinforced epoxy composites were investigated. Carbon fabric reinforced epoxy composite was used as a reference material. Sliding wear experiments were conducted using a pin-on-disc wear tester under dry contact condition. Mass loss was determined as a function of sliding velocity for loads of 25, 50, 75, and 100 N at a constant sliding distance of 6000 m. Two-body abrasive wear experiments were performed under multi-pass condition using silicon carbide (SiC) of 150 and 320 grit abrasive papers. The effects of abrading distance and different loads have been studied. Abrasive wear volume and specific wear rate as a function of applied normal load and abrading distance were also determined. The results show that in dry sliding wear situations, for increased load and sliding velocity, higher wear loss was recorded. The excellent wear characteristics were obtained with carbon-epoxy containing graphite as filler. Especially, 10 wt.% of graphite in carbon-epoxy gave a low wear rate. A graphite surface film formed on the counterface was confirmed to be effective in improving the wear characteristics of graphite filled carbon-epoxy composites. In case of two-body abrasive wear, the wear volume increases with increasing load/abrading distance. Experimental results showed the type of counterface (hardened steel disc and SiC paper) material greatly influences the wear behaviour of the composites. Wear mechanisms of the composites were investigated using scanning electron microscopy. Wear of carbon-epoxy composite was found to be mainly due to a microcracking and fiber fracture mechanisms. It was found that the microcracking mechanism had been caused by progressive surface damage. Further, it was also noticed that carbon-epoxy composite wear is reduced to a greater extent by addition of the graphite filler, in which wear was dominated by microplowing/microcutting mechanisms instead of microcracking. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain is an increasingly useful tool in the study of neurodegenerative diseases. MRI is currently the fastest developing medical imaging modality which is applied to an increasingly number of different medical diagnostic situations. Serial acquisition structural images of a subject's brain are acquired over time offers opportunities to monitor the progression of tissue volume changes in fine detail at all anatomical locations. As a result, the analysis of structural MRI data has been an active area of image analysis research for many years especially in early diagnosis, tracking of disease progression, which makes it possible to investigate how, for instance, a patient responds to treatment. The aim of the paper is to investigate and analyze brain tissue changes in Alzheimer's disease using non-rigid medical image registration and statistical analysis techniques. In our proposed approach, first the source and the target images are affinely registered to correct global differences between the images and then non-rigid registration based on free-form deformation using B-spline approximation is performed on the images. The resulting displacement values from the non-rigid registration are further investigated for deformation in the entire brain to detect typical deformation patterns. Finally, statistical method namely t-test is performed for analysis of the results. The initial results indicate that the tissue volume change in the brain occurs predominantly in the hippocampus of the brain.},

abstract={Background: The positive temperature coefficient (PTC) effect on material properties has attracted much attention in recent years due to the prospects of many applications like temperature sensors, thermistors, self-regulating heaters, etc. It has been suggested that incorporation ofmulti-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) into carbon black (CB)-filled polymers could improve the electrical properties of composites due to high conductivity and network structure and significantly reduce the required CB loading. Results: We observed no change in melting temperature and crystalline transition temperature on addition of MWNTs. However, the heat of fusion decreases as the amount of conducting carboxylated MWNT (c-MWNT) filler increases and the resistivity of the composite decreases. The free volume shows an increase up to 1.5 wt‰ of c-MWNT content and then decreases. Conclusion: Well-developed crystals could not be formed due to restricted chain mobility as filler content increases. This results in minimum intermolecular interactions, and thus a decreased heat of fusion. A composite with c-MWNT content of 0.5 wt% showed the highest PTC and higher resistivity at 150 °C possibly due to the formation of flocculated structures at elevated temperature. For filler content greater than 1.5 wt‰, the decrease in free volume may be due to restricted chain mobility. © 2009 Society of Chemical Industry.},

abstract={The present study envisages the preparation of microspheres containing indomethacin (IM) as model drug and bees wax as carrier, and to compare the in vitro release and pharmacokinetics of prepared IM formulation with commercially available oral formulation Microcid®SR. The microsphere formulations were prepared by meltable emulsified dispersion and cooling induced solidification. Surface morphology of microspheres has been evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The SEM images revealed the spherical shape of microspheres and more than 98.0% of the isolated microspheres were in the size range 115-855 μm. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy studies indicated that the drug after encapsulation with bees wax was stable and compatible. A single dose randomized complete cross over study of IM (75 mg) microspheres was carried out on 8 healthy Albino sheeps. Plasma IM concentrations and other pharmacokinetic parameters obtained were statistically analyzed. The T max, C max, AUCO-24 and T 1/2 values of Microcid ®SR and optimized formulation were 3.0 h, 2038 ± 51.31 ng/ml, 9528 ± 129.65 ng/ml h-1, and 2.59 ± 0.02 h -1; and 3.2 h, 1940 ± 22.61 ng/ml, 8751 ± 41.32 ng/ml h-1, and 2.68 ± 0.02 h-1, respectively.

Many adverse comments have been recorded in the geotechnical engineering literature on the method about its reproducibility and operator dependency. The present experimental study, which is based on a well-planned and meticulously executed experimental program, critically evaluates the effect of size of the rolled soil thread on the plastic limit of fine-grained soils and the operator dependency of the results. The results have shown that if the plastic limit tests are performed by a trained operator, then consistent results can be obtained and that the effect of size of the rolled soil thread on plastic limit is negligibly small.

For the influence of pH value on swelling behaviors, a maximum swelling ratio occurs at pH 11. Heat treatment of the hydrogels significantly improved the swelling capacity and created an obvious pH sensitive area (pH 3-4). The swelling capacity of the hydrogels was enhanced by increasing the temperature of the absorbing media. The results of swelling at different ionic strengths also indicate that the ionic strength can considerably weaken the swelling abilities of the NC hydrogels. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={This paper deals with the design & development of a theft control system for an automobile, which is being used to prevent / control the theft of a vehicle. The developed system makes use of an embedded system based on GSM technology. The designed & developed system is installed in the vehicle. An interfacing mobile is also connected to the microcontroller, which is in turn, connected to the engine. Once, the vehicle is being stolen, the information is being used by the vehicle owner for further processing. The information is passed onto the central processing insurance system, where by sitting at a remote place, a particular number is dialed by them to the interfacing mobile that is with the hardware kit which is installed in the vehicle. By reading the signals received by the mobile, one can control the ignition of the engine; say to lock it or to stop the engine immediately. Again it will come to the normal condition only after entering a secured password. The owner of the vehicle & the central processing system will know this secured password. The main concept in this design is introducing the mobile communications into the embedded system. The designed unit is very simple & low cost. The entire designed unit is on a single chip. When the vehicle is stolen, owner of vehicle may inform to the central processing system, then they will stop the vehicle by just giving a ring to that secret number and with the help of SIM tracking knows the location of vehicle and informs to the local police or stops it from further movement. © 2008 IEEE.},

The room temperature resistivity of the composites decreased significantly with increasing GNF content, but this was not always the case with the PTC intensity. The incorporation of a small amount of GNF into the HDPE/CB composites significantly improved the PTC intensity and reproducibility of the hybrid nanocomposites. The maximum PTC effect, whose log intensity was approximately 7.2, was observed in the HDPE/CB/GNF (80/20/0.25 wt%) nanocomposite with relatively low room temperature resistivity.

abstract={Composites were fabricated by impregnating needle punched polyester nonwoven fabric in the latex composition containing PVAc/MF (90/10) blend. Different amounts of flame retarardant (FR) were incorporated into PVAc latex blend viz., 100/0, 90/10, 80/20, 70/30, and 60/40 dry, weight-by-weight. The selected FR was a synergistic FR system containing antimony trioxide and brominated organic additive. The effects of different amounts of FR in PVAc/MF latex blend on physico-mechanical properties like tensile strength, percentage elongation, specific tensile strength, and reinforcement factor of the composites have been studied. The combustion behavior of the composites has been studied using the cone calorimeter. The combustion studies revealed that the incorporation of FR significantly lowered the percentage mass loss and heat release rate of the composites. A linear relationship was found between the total oxygen consumed and peak heat release rate. From the results, it can be observed that the rate of heat release, peak heat release rate, and the total oxygen consumed by the composites have been significantly reduced with increase in the FR. The total smoke production and smoke release rate of the composites have been increased with increase in the FR. The arbitrary scale developed by Petrella was discussed to assess the hazard of composites. © 2009 SAGE Publications.},

abstract={Super adsorbent Polyacrylamide (PAAm)/nanoclay (laponite, Lap) hydrogels were prepared by in situ free radical polymerization of AAm in an aqueous solution with, clay as a crosslinker. The swelling properties and water-soluble cationic dye adsorption behaviors of the PAAm/laponite (PAAm/Lap) nanocomposite (NC) hydrogels were investigated. The parameters of swelling and diffusion of water in dye solutions were evaluated for the PAAm/Lap NC hydrogels. The adsorption behavior of the monovalent cationic dyes such, as Basic Blue 12 (BB 12), Basic Blue 9 (BB 9), and Basic Violet 1 (BV 1), were studied on the NC hydrogels. The effects of the clay content of the hydrogel on its cationic dye uptake behavior were studied. The adsorption studies indicated that the rates of dye uptake by the NC hydrogels increased in the following order: BB 9 > BB 12 > BV 1. This order is similar to the swelling results of the PAAm/Lap NC hydrogel in the dye solutions. The equilibrium uptakes of the different dyes by the PAAm/Lap NC hydrogel were nearly the same. In the dye absorption studies, S-type adsorption in the Giles classification system was found for the BB 12 and BV 1 dyes, whereas L-type was observed for the BB 9 dye. After the heat treatment of PAAm/Lap, the rate of dye uptake and equilibrium dye uptake were increased. The NC hydrogels may be considered as a. good, candidate for environmental applications to retain more water and to remove dyes. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Composites fabricated with five parts MFincorporated PVAc showed a drastic increase in the onset degradation temperature when compared with unfilled composites. It was found that the degradation of MFloaded PVAc-polyester nonwoven fabric composites takes place in two steps. Degradation kinetic parameters were calculated for the composites using Broido and Horowitz-Metzger methods. The tensile fractured composite specimens were analyzed using scanning electron microscope to know the morphological behavior.

abstract={This article elaborates the development of elitist Genetic Algorithm (GA) models for the optimization of high volume fly ash concrete (HVFAC) mix. The model consists of two stages. In the first stage, a huge database of 350 mix designs garnered through standard research publications were statstistically analyzed to elicit upper and lower bounds of certain range constraints and rational ratio constraints of functional parameters. In the second stage, elitist GA is applied to find the quantities of cement, fly ash, and water for maximized strength of the mix. Optimal mix proportions of these important ingredients are computed corresponding to five ranges of 28 day' strength by augmenting the algorithm with appropriate constraint ranges obtained in the first stage. The optimized proportions of ingredients in all the five cases are encouraging and corroborate very well with the experimental results. The outcome of this work is useful in reducing the number of trial mixtures with desired properties in the field tests.},

abstract={Fiber-reinforced polymeric composites (FRPCs) have emerged as an important material for automotive, aerospace, and other engineering applications because of their light weight, design flexibility, ease of manufacturing, and improved mechanical performance. In this study, glass-epoxy (G-E) and silicon carbide filled glass-epoxy (SiC-G-E) composite systems have been fabricated using hand lay-up technique. The mechanical properties such as tensile strength, tensile modulus, elongation at break, flexural strength, and hardness have been investigated in accordance with ASTM standards. From the experimental investigations, it has been found that the tensile strength, flexural strength, and hardness of the glass reinforced epoxy composite increased with the inclusion of SiC filler. The results of the SiC (5 wt %)-G-E composite showed higher mechanical properties compared to G-E system. The dielectric properties such as dielectric constant (permittivity), tan delta, dielectric loss, and AC conductivity of these composites have been evaluated. A drastic reduction in dielectric constant after incorporation of conducting SiC filler into epoxy composite has been observed.

abstract={Flowable fill is a self-levelling and self-compacting, cementitious material which is primarily used as a backfill. It is a mixture of fine aggregates, small amount of cement, water and a by-product material. In this present experimental study, three industrial by-products namely fly ash, rice husk ash and quarry dust were used as constituent materials in flowable fill. Mix proportions were developed for different combination of these industrial by-products, in addition to small amount of cement content. The main objective of the present investigation is to study the stress-strain behaviour of these mixes, namely unconfined compressive strength (UCS), strain corresponding to peak stress, strain corresponding to fracture and modulus of elasticity. In addition, several mixes were tested for few other properties such as flowability, density, water-absorption and volume changes. The range of strengths, strains and moduli of elasticity obtained for these flowable fill mixtures represents different types of clay soils ranging from soft clays to very stiff clays. Thus, industrial by-products such as fly ash, rice husk ash and quarry dust can be beneficially added in flowable fill that offers comparable strengths to soils used for conventional fills and many other low-strength applications. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.},

Many stringent precautionary safety and disposal measures have to be exercised before its use in the laboratory. The present technical note presents the wax method of determining the shrinkage limit of soil in the laboratory which does not require the use of mercury, and also to substantiate the method proposed by the ASTM standard. It involves the use of wax as a coating on the dry soil pat and the water displacement method for the determination of the dry volume of soil pat. The experimental results have shown that the values of shrinkage limit of soils determined by the wax method and by the mercury displacement method are within certain statistical bounds.

abstract={The peculiar nature in which one or more consonants combine with vowels to produce a compound character in Kannada language results in a huge number of character combinations, running to tens of thousands or more. The aim of the work is therefore, to reduce the number of character combinations by employing a divide and conquer technique. In the first level of the technique, the structural and the dynamic features of online handwritten Kannada characters are exploited to segment the compound Kannada characters into 282 distinct symbols. This reduction in the number of classes overcomes the huge data collection problem and also reduces the computational complexity. In the second level, these 282 symbols are further divided into three distinct sets of stroke groups, thus further reducing the search space for the recognition engine. One or more of these stroke groups can combine to form any of the thousands of Kannada compound characters. Since the focus of this paper is the above strategy, a simple classifier has been used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in handling the difficult task of recognizing all possible character combinations of Kannada. The features extracted from the segmented stroke groups are mapped to lower dimensional space using PCA. The subspace features of distinct stroke groups are fed to the respective classifiers in an order and the output of these classifiers are combined to output the Unicode of the recognized akshara. The proposed work is an attempt made for the first time in Kannada language which considers all possible combinations of symbols, including Kannada numerals. Copyright © 2009 ACM.},

abstract={The rapid process of automation in recent times involves the development of efficient algorithms in machine intelligence. Man-machine interface in most areas of application involves vision systems to recognize texts and objects. In either case this finally reduces to the machine analysis of images ultimately leading to classification of images either as a whole or in segmented form. Images are represented as matrices in some form or the other. Characterization of matrices for efficient classification is a challenging task. Reduction of dimensionality is important in applications that need to handle large number of such matrices. Image recognition and in particular character recognition is an excellent example where large number of image matrices need to be stored and retrieved often at high speed, at the same time performing computational tasks, resulting in requirements of huge memory and computation time. Characterization in various forms could result in reduction in dimensionality to different extents. This paper proposes the use of dominant singular values as distinct characteristic features of rectangular image matrices suitable for reliable classification.

abstract={Nanocomposites of high density polyethylene (HDPE) reinforced with hybrid fillers of polyaniline coated multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWNT), and carbon black (CB) were developed aiming at enhancing the electrical conductivity of the composites. The electrical properties such as volume resistivity, impedance, and conductance have been measured as a function of filler volume concentration (%), frequency and voltage. The electrical property such as volume resistivity depends on the concentration of fillers. This is due to the formation of a continuous conducting network throughout the polymer matrix with increase in the conducting filler. This kind of variation is referred as Maxwell-Wagner effect. The resistance of the prepared PANI/c-MWNT/CB/HDPE nanocomposites is found to be ohmic. It was shown that adding CB in PANI/c-MWCNTs composites can enhance the electrical properties of the nanocomposites: a low percolation threshold was achieved with 0.25 wt% CNTs and 20 wt% of CB/HDPE. CB enhanced the ductility of the nanocomposites, confirming the synergic effect of CB as effective multi-functional filler. © 2008 SPIE.},

abstract={The paper focuses on a low-dimensional color-based indexing technique for achieving efficient and effective retrieval performance. We have implemented the technique of retrieval of images from databases based on color feature extracted from each region/regions of an image represented by dominant or representative color descriptor. Each image is segmented using Mean Shift algorithm, a robust clustering technique to extract color feature of a region of interest. Image databases have been designed and the image region features are ingested into them. Indexing data structures are designed to support basic operations on image databases such as search, insertion, and deletion. Search efficiency is considered as the most important aspect because search is normally carried out on-line. The new algorithm cluster-based R*-tree indexing is proposed and compared the efficiency with R* -tree and sequential search. The accuracy of the retrieval system is measured and compared the results. Experimental results show the high performance of the proposed method. The toolbox is developed in JAVA to incorporate all these modules and retrieve images based on query-by-example.},

abstract={Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural networks have been receiving wider attention among the neural network research community after the Back Propagation (BP) trained Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Feed Forward Neural Networks. The main reasons are their simple structure and ease of training. Several variants of RBF learning algorithms are available for solving classification, function approximation and regression problems. In any neural network system, proper identification of architecture and their parameter initialization assumes greater significance to accomplish better performance. There have been a large number of proposals on automatic development of architectures during learning to ease out the frustration caused by trial and error based schemes to fix up the so called optimal architectures. However their focus has been confined to one objective, ie to reduce the number of RBF units. Among the several variants of constructive learning networks, Platt's Resource Allocating Network (RAN) is still one of the popular incremental learning networks that has been tried on several problem types and still research is underway to fine tune it to maximize its performance. RAN has several limitations as it is sensitive to outliers and builds larger networks resulting in memorization consequently leading poor generalization. The best part of this algorithm is its fast convergence. Hence there is substantial scope to improve its performance. In this paper, we propose two new ideas to improve the performance of RAN. In the first instance, we calculate the medoids from samples in respective pattern classes. Secondly we pick a small percentage of significant patterns based on the farthest neighbor concept. The medoids and the significant patterns are collectively used to train the RAN. The entire samples in the input space are used to test the generalization performance of the network. Benchmark datasets have been used to experiment the proposed techniques. Results reveal significant enhancement in the performance of the RAN compared to traditional RAN.},

abstract={Polyaniline-carboxylic acid functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotube (PAni/c-MWNT) nanocomposites were prepared in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) emulsion. First, the c-MWNTs were dispersed in SDS emulsion then the aniline was polymerized by the addition of ammonium persulfate in the absence of any added acid. SDS forms the functionalized counterion in the resulting nanocomposites. The content of c-MWNTs in the nanocomposites varied from 0 to 20 wt%. A uniform coating of PAni was observed on the c-MWNTs by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). The PAni/c-MWNT nanocomposites have been characterized by different spectroscopic methods such as UV-Visible, FT-Raman, and FT-IR. The UV-Visible spectra of the PAni/c-MWNT nanocomposites exhibited an additional band at around 460 nm, which implies the induced doping of the MWNTs by the carboxyl group. The FT-IR spectra of the PAni/c-MWNT nanocomposites showed an inverse intensity ratio of the bands at 1562 and 1480cm-1 as compared to that of pure PAni, which reveals that the PAni in the nanocomposites is richer in quinoid units than the pure PAni. The increase in the thermal stability of conductivity of the nanocomposites was due to the network structure of nanotubes and the charge transfer between the quinoid rings of the PAni and the c-MWNTs.

abstract={Human gait is a spatio-temporal phenomenon and typifies the motion characteristics of an individual. The gait of a person is easily recognizable when extracted from a sideview of the person. Accordingly, gait-recognition algorithms work best when presented with images where the person walks parallel to the camera (i.e. the image plane).A set of stances or key frames that occur during the walk cycle of an individual is chosen. This paper presents a novel approach adopted in automatic gait recognition in which the silhouette extracted is represented using, maximal information compression index λ which is nothing but the eigen value for the direction normal to the principle component direction of feature pair (x, y) and extracts the periodicity of the gait and are tested on the data sets and is found to be quite satisfactory in natural walk conditions. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={This study reports characterization of polyurethane/polymethyl methacrylate (PU/PMMA, 50/50) Semi-Interpenetrating Polymer Network (SIPN) prepared by in-situ polymerization, and filled with different weight percent (wt%) of natural polymer, Gaur-Gum (GG). These are characterized for density, tensile strength and percentage elongation at break. Positron annihilation lifetime measurements have also been carried out to measure the free volume of these composites. The results show good correlation between free volume content of the composites with the mechanical properties. These natural polymer-filled composites were subjected to biodegradation using a specific microorganism, Aspergillus niger. The influence of A. niger on composites has also been studied. The results show that the weight loss of the specimens exposed to A. niger media increases with increase in gaur gum in the composite. Interestingly the weight loss of GG-filled composites seems to be more than the quantum of GG incorporated which is a clear indication that degradation of PU/PMMA system is responsible for the weight loss. © SAGE Publications 2008.},

abstract={In this paper we study electrohydrodynamic instability (EHDI) in a poorly conducting parallel inviscid fluid in the presence of an electric field and space variation of electrical conductivity. It is shown that EHDI causes inhomogeniety in the material science processing. This inhomogeniety can be controlled by understanding the nature of EHDI in the presence of an electric field and a shear due to horizontal basic velocity. The condition for EHDI is determined in terms of the electric number rather than the point of inflexion of the basic velocity profile using both moment and energy methods combined with Galerkin expansion technique. From this analysis, it is shown that a proper choice of electric number controls inhomogeniety by controlling instability of a parallel poorly conducting inviscid fluid. For unstable motion it is shown that the growth rate, Ci, is confined in a semi circle regionCr2 + Ci2 - 2 fenced(ub - frac(Ω, φ)) Cr + ub2 - 2 ub frac(Ω, φ) = 0,which has the center (ub - Ω / φ, 0) and radius | Ω / φ | where Cr is the phase velocity, ub the basic horizontal velocity, φ = D2 ub, Ω = W1 x02 α2 the electric number and D = d / dy. From this an upper bound for the amplification factor is shown to be asCi2 ≤ max fenced(frac(Ω, φ))2,under the condition that φ has the same sign between 0 and 1. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={As process geometries are shrinking, width of the metal layer is continuously decreasing, height of the layer and wire lengths are increasing, thereby increasing the effect of coupling capacitances. Coupling induced crosstalk may induce unwanted noise on coupled signal nets resulting in functional failure and performance degradation and becomes a significant limitation in achieving first pass silicon success. At the same time the complexity of noise analysis has significantly increased due to factors such as driver weakening, IR drop, power network switching, voltage scaling and variations in manufacturing processes. Therefore validating the capabilities and verifying the analysis of a crosstalk analysis tool for current and future process nodes is very critical for efficient and accurate signoff analysis. The modeling of the cell itself needs to be accurate and comprehensive. The objective of the paper is to share the methodology and challenges involved in Crosstalk Noise Analysis and how the Composite Current Source (CCS) based Crosstalk Noise Analysis capability of PrimeTime SI would help us achieve many of our goals. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper reports the development of an optimal neural network model for stress-strain behaviour of steel fibre reinforced concrete in direct compression. For this, an algorithm which combines the Akaike's information criterion (AIC) with the golden-section optimisation technique has been implemented. The extensive computational experiments have been successful in finding a network topology with excellent generalisation capabilities. The model was developed using the experimental results of doctoral research work of the second author. The parameters for modeling included the reinforcing index, the material parameter, and peak stress corresponding to peak strain and normalised strain. The output of the model is the normalised stress. The computational experiments used to implement the method are carried out by employing the three-layer back propagation neural network. The application of the combined algorithm resulted in an optimal topology of 4-26-1. The results of the model were excellent. However, a deviation of 0-15% was noticed in the post peak strain region when compared with experimental results.},

abstract={This paper presents heat transfer analysis of in-line arrangement of bare tube bundles in gas-solid(air-solid) fluidized bed and predictions are done by using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based on the experimental data. Measurement of average heat transfer coefficient was made by local thermal simulation technique in a cold square bubbling air-fluidized bed of size 0.305m × 0.305m. Studies were conducted for bare tube bundles of in -line arrangement using beds of small (average particle diameter less than 1mm) silica sand particles and of large (average particle diameter greater than 1mm) particle (raagi and mustard). Within the range of experimental conditions influence of bed particle diameter (Dp), fluidizing velocity (U) were studied, which are significant parameters affecting heat transfer. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been receiving an increasing attention for simulating engineering systems due to some interesting characteristics such as learning capability, fault tolerance, and non-linearity. Here, feed-forward architecture and trained by back-propagation technique is adopted to predict heat transfer analysis found from experimental results. The ANN is designed to suit the present system which has 3 inputs and 2 outputs. The network predictions are found to be in very good agreement with the experimental observed values of bare tube heat transfer coefficient (hb) and Nusselt number of bare tube (Nub).

The tests were carried out for 270, 540, 810, and 1,080 m abrading distances at 22 and 32 N loads. The worn surfaces were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results showed varied responses under different abrading distance due to the addition of glass fabric/graphite filler into neat epoxy. It was observed that the glass fabric reinforcement to epoxy matrix (G-E) is not beneficial to abrasive wear resistance. Further, inclusion of graphite filler to glass fabric reinforced epoxy composite performed poorly resulting in significant deterioration in wear performance while the neat epoxy showed better wear performance. Selected mechanical properties such as hardness, ultimate tensile strength, and elongation at fracture were analyzed for investigating wear property correlations.

abstract={Practical situations wherein the soil is subjected to static stress reversals are many, and in this context, understanding the engineering behavior of soil in the field subjected to such static stress reversals gains importance. The present paper deals with the study of the effect of static cyclic loading on compressibility and permeability behavior of fine-grained soils of different clay mineralogical composition, both in the undisturbed and remolded states. The static stress reversals enable the soils to reach a "near equilibrium state" in terms of volume change, whether the soil is initially in the undisturbed state or in the remolded state. The stress history of a soil has been shown to have definite influence on the coefficient of consolidation and permeability of fine-grained soils. Soil clay mineralogy has been observed to control the nature of variation of the behavior of soils subjected to static stress reversals. Copyright © 2008 by ASTM International.},

abstract={A novel colon targeted tablet formulation was developed using natural polysaccharides such as chitosan and guar gum as carriers and diltiazem hydrochloride as model drug. The prepared blend of polymer-drug tablets were coated with two layers, inulin as an inner coat followed by shellac as outer coat and were evaluated for properties such as average weight, hardness and coat thickness. In vitro release studies of prepared tablets were carried out for 2 h in pH 1.2 HCl buffer, 3 h in pH 7.4 phosphate buffer and 6 h in simulated colonic fluid (SCF) in order to mimic the conditions from mouth to colon. It was observed that 4% w/v of rat cecal contents in saline phosphate buffer (SCF) incubated for 24 h provides suitable conditions for in vitro evaluation of the formulations prepared. The drug release from the coated system was monitored using UV/ Visible spectroscopy. In vitro studies revealed that the tablets coated with inulin and shellac have controlled the drug release in stomach and small intestinal environment and released maximum amount of drug in the colonic environment. Among the polymers used, chitosan was found to be the suitable polymer for colon targeting. The study revealed that polysaccharides as carriers and inulin and shellac as coating materials can be used effectively for colon targeting of drugs for treating local as well as systemic disorders. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={As the construction industry continues to recognise the importance of sustainable development, technologies such as controlled low-strength material (CLSM) have come to the forefront as viable means of safely and efficiently using by-product and waste materials in infrastructure applications. CLSM, also known as flowable fill, can be defined as an engineered backfill material containing fine aggregates, Portland cement, water and a by-product material. CLSM can provide an economically and technically feasible alternative to conventional fill materials because of potential cost savings related to its unique and often superior technical properties. In this present experimental study, three industrial by-products, namely fly ash (FA), rice husk ash (RHA) and quarry dust (QD), were used as constituent materials in CLSM. Mixture proportions were developed for CLSM containing these industrial by-products and were tested in the laboratory for various properties, such as flowability, unconfined compressive strength (UCS), stress-strain behaviour, density, water absorption and volume changes. Comparison between the two pozzolanic materials, namely FA and RHA, for their potential to produce an effective CLSM has been made. It can be observed from the results that by-product materials such as FA, RHA and QD can be successfully used in CLSM. This successful utilization of by-product materials is important to sustainable development and is the focus of this research. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) is currently a very important area of research in multimedia databases based on low-level descriptors, such as texture, color and shape. Search operations in such databases require some special support at the physical level. This is true for conventional databases as well as for image databases, where typical search operations include the point query and the region query. Here indexing plays a fundamental role in supporting efficient retrieval of sequences of images, individual images and selected subimages from multimedia repositories. Three categories of information are extracted and indexed in image databases such as metadata, objects and features, and relations between objects. This survey is devoted to indexing structures for objects and features. Plenty of research work has been undertaken in the past decade to design efficient image retrieval techniques from the image or multimedia databases. Although large numbers of indexing and retrieval techniques have been developed, there is still no universally accepted feature extraction, indexing and retrieval technique available. In this paper, we present an up-to-date review of various indexing structures for image retrieval. Since the volume of literature available in the field is enormous, only selected works are mentioned. ICIC International © 2008.},

abstract={This paper focuses on a low-dimensional color-based indexing technique for achieving efficient and effective retrieval performance. We have developed a region based image retrieval toolbox (IMAGE: Indexing Multidimensional data And Grouping for Efficient Retrieval) that aims at searching image databases for specific image regions that are similar to the given query image region using color feature. The mean shift segmentation algorithm, a robust clustering technique based on color is used to extract region of interest, thereby improving the quality of image retrieval. The region feature attribute is computed at the time of ingest into the database. The cluster (region) mode (color value) is used as representative of image in 3-D color space. To efficiently retrieve the images from database cluster-based R*-Tree indexing method is proposed. Here only representative features of clusters are used for indexing, thus reducing the time. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method is compared with R*-Tree and sequential search. Experimental results show the performance of the proposed method. The prototype is developed to retrieve images based on query-by-example in JAVA. © 2007 IEEE.},

To classify unknown faces they need to match the nearest neighbor in the stored database of extracted face features. Pattern recognition system performs a classification function on its input.

GCS generates compact network architecture in less training time and performs well on new untrained data, establishing its feasibility in tool wear estimation applications.

Composites were fabricated by impregnating polyester nonwoven fabric with aqueous carbon black (CB) filled poly (styrene-co-butyl acrylate) latex. The effect of the amount of CB on the mechanical and electrical properties has been studied. Tensile strength, stitch tear strength and surface hardness were reduced by an increase in the wt.% of CB. The percentage elongation of the composites increased drastically because of the presence of diethylene glycol plasticiser in the CB dispersion. The dielectric constant, dissipation factor and loss factor of the composites increased with increasing wt.% of CB and decreased with increasing frequency. The reduction in dielectric properties with increasing frequency could be due to the delocalisation of charge carriers. ©Smithers Rapra Technology, 2008.},

abstract={The electrically conductive elastomer blends based on styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS) tri-block copolymer and polyaniline-dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid (PANI.DBSA) were prepared by two methods, namely, melt mixing and in situ polymerization of aniline in the presence of SBS. The influence of composition and synthetic methods on the properties of SBS/PANI has been studied. SBS/PANI blends are characterized for physico-mechanical properties such as density, tensile strength and tensile modulus. A drastic reduction in volume resistivity with increase in PANI content is noticed for blends prepared by in situ polymerization compared to melt mixing method. Using Porod's law we have estimated the interface thickness and the value turns out to be 0.55 ± 0.04 in all cases. The microstructural parameters such as long mean periodicity (LM), crystalline length (LC), amorphous length (LA), correlation length (LCOR) and percentage of crystallinity are estimated in these blends using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data.

abstract={Sorptive removal of phenol from synthetic aqueous solutions by bagasse fly ash (BFA) was investigated at 303 K under dynamic conditions in a packed bed. The effects of sorbent bed length (Z = 40-90 cm), flow rate (Q = 0.01-0.04 dm3/min), bed diameter (D = 2-4 cm), and initial concentration (C0 = 50-500 mg/ dm3) on the sorption characteristics of phenol were investigated at an influent pH of 6.5. More than 99.5% of phenol was removed in the column operated at C0 =100 mg/dm3 of phenol. The column performance improved with increasing Z and decreasing Q. The Bohart-Adams, Thomas, Yoon-Nelson, Clark, and Wolborska models were applied to the experimental data to represent the breakthrough curves and determine the characteristic design parameters of the column. The bed depth service time (BDST) model at 50% breakthrough provided a good fit to the experimental data, and the sorption capacity of the adsorbent was close to the value predicted from a batch study. The sorption performance of the BFA columns could be well described by the Thomas, Yoon-Nelson, and Clark models at effluent-to-influent concentration ratios (Cl C0) higher than 0.08 and lower than 0.99. Application of the Wolborska model to the experimental data for C/C0 &lt;0.5 enabled the determination of the kinetic coefficients for mass transfer in these systems. All of the models can be applied to describe the dynamic behavior of the column sorption with respect to bed length and flow rates. The sorptive capacity of BFA for phenol was found to be 9.93 mg/g. © 2008 American Chemical Society.},

The wear volume increases with an increase in load/abrading distance for all composites. From the experimental wear data it was observed that the abrasive wear of the composites dependent on the applied load and abrading distance. Further, the cenospheres filler inclusion in glass fiber reinforced epoxy (G-E) composite showed poor abrasive wear performance.

abstract={Human gait is a spatio-temporal phenomenon and typifies the motion characteristics of an individual. The gait of a person is easily recognisable when extracted from a side view of the person. Accordingly, gait-recognition algorithms work best when presented with images where the person walks parallel to the camera (i.e. the image plane). A set of stances or key frames that occur during the walk cycle of an individual is chosen. This paper presents a novel approach adopted in automatic gait recognition in which the silhouette extracted is represented using Shannon entropy and extracts the height of the subject and periodicity of the gait. To classify unknown gait, they need to match the nearest neighbour in the stored database of extracted gait features, and the proposed approach are tested on the data sets and is found to be quite satisfactory in natural walk conditions. In addition, the proposed decision fusion enables the performance improvement by integrating multiple ones with different confidence measures. © 2008 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

The drug release from the coated systems was monitored using UV/Vis spectroscopy. In vitro studies revealed that the tablets coated with inulin and shellac have limited the drug release in stomach and small intestinal environment and released maximum amount of drug in the colonic environment.

abstract={Semi-interpenetrating polymer networks (semi-IPNs) of epoxy resin and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) were synthesized. Methyl methacrylate (MMA) was polymerized by free radical mechanism with azo-bis-isobutyronitrile in the presence of oligomeric epoxy resin (DGEBA), and hexahydrophthalic anhydride as crosslinking agent. The gelation and vitrification transitions during cure/polymerization processes have been examined using parallel-plates rheological technique. From differential scanning calorimetry and rheological techniques, it was suggested that both curing and polymerization processes occur simultaneously. However, the gelation time was longer for the semi-IPN than those observed for the cure of pure DGEBA or polymerization of MMA. The gelation time increased significantly when 5% of MMA was employed, suggesting a diluent effect of the monomer. Higher amount of MMA resulted in a decrease of gel time, probably because of the simultaneous polymerization of MMA during the curing process. Structural examination of the semi-IPNs, using scanning electron microscopy, revealed phase separation in nanoscale size for semi-IPNs containing PMMA at concentrations up to 15%. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={One of the main challenges facing mobile communication is reducing the power consumption of the communication interface. One standard approach for reducing power consumption involves lowering the transmit power to the minimum level that still achieves correct reception of a packet despite intervening path loss and fading. Adopting this minimization approach, we describe an Adaptive Transmit Power Control in 802.11 Wireless Networks for Access Points. Significant research has been done to improve the performance of IEEE 802.11 Wireless Network by controlling the transmit power but, which are based on path loss, and for Ad-Hoc Networks involves every station must modify its drivers or run a user level program. We present a novel scheme which can be implemented on Access Points in infrastructure network without calculating of path loss and without modifying the station. Adopting this minimization approach, this paper proposes a novel scheme which assign correct transmit power level based on distance and interference caused by obstacles between communicating interfaces. Our approach satisfies the three main objectives, Energy- Efficient utilization, minimizing the interference, and adaptive to mobility.},

In this paper, we propose two new ideas to improve the performance of RAN. In the first instance, we calculate the medoids from samples in respective pattern classes. Secondly we pick a small percentage of significant patterns based on the farthest neighbor concept. The medoids and the significant patterns are collectively used to train the RAN. The entire samples in the input space are used to test the generalization performance of the network. Two benchmark datasets, Iris and Wine are used to experiment the proposed techniques. Results reveal significant enhancement in the performance of the RAN compared to traditional RAN. Copyright © 2007 IICAI.},

Experimental studies on modified Best Management Practices (BMP) in attenuating the phosphate revealed that infiltration trench (BMP-1) has a removal efficiency of 55%, detention basin (BMP-2) with 40%, partial ex-filtration trench (BMP-3) with 75%, vegetative swales (BMP-4) with 47% and horizontal flow filter drain (BMP-5) with 60%. In most of the cases, for economical reasons, time of attenuation and maintenance viewpoint, vegetative grass swales may become better option of best management practices for urban storm water runoff. © 2006 ASCE.},

abstract={To facilitate the predictions of movement and behavior of chemicals, a one-dimensional analytical model has been developed to predict the solute transport through the unsaturated soil zone. The characteristics feature of this model is that it takes into account the influence of various processes like adsorption, leaching, volatilization, degradation, and plant uptake simultaneously. This could be achieved by introducing a common rate constant term called as total elimination rate, which is the summation of rate constants derived from the degradation, leaching, volatilization and plant uptake processes. It is this feature of the model that sets it apart and excels from that of conventional model or process specific models or site-specific models, which tends to be expensive, time consuming, and data exhaustive. The application of the developed model has been illustrated by considering the agricultural sub soil environment. The breakthrough curves for concentration versus time and depth were generated for nitrates and phosphates and used to determine the input parameters for the developed analytical transport model. © 2007 ASCE.},

abstract={Wastewater contains organic matter, nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus, pathogens and other pollutants and its discharge in water bodies causes environmental problems like eutrophication, fish kills and odours. Research has been carried out over the years to find effective biological treatment methods to remove nutrients and in this direction the sequencing batch reactor (SBR) has demonstrated good potential for complete removal of phosphorus and nitrogen from domestic wastewater. Bench scale studies on SBR were carried out to assess its ability to develop phosphorus accumulating organisms (PAOs) in short period of time with seed material taken from sludge of septic tank and feed used was synthetic wastewater. Various researchers had reported that several months were taken to develop enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) sludge whereas in this study it was found that in a short duration of 21 days, the COD removal was 73.4% in anaerobic phase while the phosphorus removal yield (PRY) was 92%, which indicated that PAOs were grown in sufficient numbers. After enrichment, the SBR was fed with raw domestic wastewater which contained COD (260 mg/l), ammonia nitrogen (59 mg/l) and phosphorus (15.3 mg/l). The effluent at the end of the SBR cycle contained less than 15 mg/l of COD, ammonia nitrogen of less than 1 mg/l, nitrate nitrogen in the range of 10 to 11 mg/l and phosphorus in the range of 0 to 1.5 mg/l. The denitrification observed was 100% in the anaerobic phase. To remove nitrate nitrogen completely, an anoxic batch reactor was started and the final effluent contained COD of less than 20 mg/l, nitrate nitrogen less than 1 mg/l, phosphorus concentration less than 2.2 mg/l and ammonia nitrogen concentration of less than 2 mg/l. Kinetic study was done to determine the rate at which microbes treat wastewater to remove nutrients and it was observed that COD uptake was 0.058 mg COD/mg VSS within one hour from the start of anaerobic phase and corresponding phosphorus release was 3.49*10 -4 mg phosphorus/mg VSS. The denitrification rate observed was 3.40* -4 mg nitrate nitrogen/mg VSS. The kinetic study also showed the phosphorus uptake was 5.04*10 -3 mg phosphorus/mg VSS and the nitrification was 3.33*10 -3 mg ammonia nitrogen/mg VSS in the first one hour of aerobic phase. © 2007 ASCE.},

abstract={High level concentration of fluoride affects human health by causing incurable skeletal and dental fluorosis, non-skeletal manifestation and combinations of above. Defluoridation techniques have been developed and implemented are not continuous and cost effective. At present there is an urgent need of having economically viable continuous flow defluoridation units for rural areas. This study evolves with a noval modification in the popular Nalgonda technique as a continuous flow economical defluoridation unit. Experiments on horizontal and vertical flow defluoridation filter baffles comprising of locally available materials like wood charcoal, medium coarse sand & brick jelly with Nalgonda chemicals revealed that the fluoride removal efficiency of 68% in the pH range of 7 to 8.5 for the maximum 4 mg/l of fluoride concentration has been observed. The economical analysis performed between the assumed extension of a particular comprehensive water supply scheme and the water supply scheme designed with the evolved continuous flow defluoridation unit costs only 26% of the general comprehensive water supply scheme. The independent defluoridation unit costs only 13% of the total cost of the proposed water supply scheme. © 2007 ASCE.},

Molecular transport of n-alkanes into prepared carboxylic acid chain extended PUs has been studied at different temperatures, viz., 25, 40, and 60°C using a gravimetric sorption method. The sorption (S), the diffusion (D), and the permeation (P) coefficients for n-alkane penetrants have been calculated. Transport data are affected by the nature of the interacting solvent molecules, molar volume, solubility parameters, temperature, and the structural variation of the chain extended PUs. The temperature dependence of the transport coefficient has been used to estimate the kinetic parameters for the processes of diffusion (ED) and permeation (EP) from the Arrhenius plots.

abstract={The primary objective of this work is to categorize the available fly ashes in different parts of the world into distinct groups based on its compositional attributes. Kohonen's self-organizing feature map and radial basis function networks are utilized for the classification of fly ashes in terms of its chemical parameters. The basic procedure of the methodology consists of three stages: (1) apply self -organizing neural net and delineate distinct groups of fly ashes and identify the group sensitive attributes; (2) find mean values of sensitive attributes of the elicited groups and augment them as start-up prototypes for k-means algorithm and find the refined centroids of these groups; (3) incorporate the centroids in a two layer radial basis function network and refine the delineation of the groups and develop an indexing equation using the weights of the stabilized network. Further, to demonstrate the utility of this classification scheme, the so formed groups were correlated with their performance in High Volume Fly Ash Concrete System [HVFAC]. The categorization was found to be excellent and compares well with Canadian Standard Association's [CSA A 3000] classification scheme.},

A mathematical model as a preprocessing step is also suggested for existing FLD based methods to improve the classification performance. We have also carried out experiments to study the robust behavior of these algorithms under several noise conditions modeled by continuous distributions and used in their discretized version. We observed the performances of these algorithms on data taken from three standard databases namely ORL, FERET and the Yale. Some theoretical aspects of the algorithm and the analysis of the simulations are also presented. Copyright © 2007 IICAI.},

abstract={Industry demands optimal performance from the machineries. The performance of manually operated and human monitored systems are mainly dependent on the operating personnel. Production process and optimal performance of automated process can further be improved if human intelligence and observations can be inbuilt into a machine system. In automated machine tools, condition monitoring of cutting tools is very important to determine the expected tool life. Tool monitoring is becoming important as most of the times reduced performance is attributed to worn out tools. Acoustic Emission (AE) signal analysis has emerged as a promising tool condition monitoring technique. AE Signal parameters such as Ring Down Count (RDC), Rise Time (RTT), Event Duration (EDT), Energy (ENT) and Peak Amplitude (PA) have been widely used by various researchers in tool status monitoring. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have emerged as powerful pattern classifiers because of their better generalization and fault tolerance. Artificial Neural Networks(ANN) have high discriminatory power to handle variations in the input features. In this research work, we have implemented a incremental learning Radial Basis Function (RBF) called Resource Allocating Network (RAN) neural network trained using the Acoustic Emission Parameters as input features. The trained neurnl network is capable of handling input features with noise and predict the condition of tool.},

abstract={Wear of cutting tools is very important in manufacturing industry. Study and analysis of each tool is extremely useful in the tool condition monitoring process. Determination of optimal cutting conditions and prediction of expected tool life is gaining momentum. Various measurable parameters and their correlative results are essential in taking steps to make the tool health monitoring process on-line and minimize downtime in productive environments. Condition monitoring of the cutting tools is very important as the process capability and process parameters may be evaluated based on the condition of the tool. Wear of the tool tip generates poor surface finish and an unexpected tool failure may damage the tool, work piece and the machine tool. Advanced manufacturing demands an optimal machining process with proper control of machining parameters. Efforts are on to make control of most of the machining parameters on-line. Many problems that affect optimization are related to the diminished machine performance caused by worn out tools. One of the most promising tool condition monitoring technique is based on the analysis of acoustic emission (AE) signals. Generation of the AE signals in the cutting zone makes them sensitive to changes in the cutting process. Experiments were conducted on select specimens of steel using select varieties of cutting tools inserts on a high speed lathe for some specific cutting conditions. The AE signal analysis is carried out using, ring down count (RDC), rise time (RTT), event duration (EDT), energy (ENT) and peak amplitude (PA).},

abstract={Symbolic data represents a general form of classical data. There has been a highly focused research on the analysis of symbolic data in recent years. Since most of the future applications involve such general form of data, there is a need to explore novel methods to analyze such data. In this paper we present two simple novel approaches for the classification of symbolic data.1 In the first step, we show the representation of symbolic data in binary form and then use a simple hamming distance measure to obtain the clusters from binarised symbolic data. This gives the Class label and the number of samples in each cluster. In the second part we pick a specific percentage of significant data samples in each cluster and use them to train the Adaptive Auto-configuring neural network. The training automatically builds an optimal architecture for the shown samples. Complete data has been used to test the generalization property of the RBF network. We demonstrate the proposed approach on the soybean bench mark data set and results are discussed. It is found that the proposed neural network works well for symbolic data opening further investigations for data mining applications. © 2007 IEEE.},

abstract={A detailed study on the removal of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) from the filtered/unfiltered exhaust of a stationary diesel engine was carried out using non-thermal plasma (pulsed electrical discharge plasma) process and cascaded processes namely plasma- adsorbent and plasma-catalyst processes. The superior performance of discharge plasma with regard to NOx removal, energy consumption and formation of by-products in unfiltered exhaust environment is identified. In the cascaded plasma-adsorbent process, the plasma was cascaded with adsorbents (MS13X/Activated alumina/Activated charcoal). The cascaded process treating unfiltered exhaust exhibits a very high NOx removal compared to the individual processes and further, the cascaded process gives almost the same NOx removal efficiency irrespective of type of adsorbent used. In the cascaded plasma-catalyst process, the plasma was cascaded with activated alumina catalyst at high temperature. The synergy effect and improved performance of the cascaded process are explained. Further, experiments were conducted at room temperature as well as at higher temperatures. © 2007 IEEE.},

Presence of additional modified characters, which get plugged in as extensions and remain as disjointed protrusions of a main character is really challenging in estimating inclination in skewed documents made up of texts in south Indian languages (Kannada, Telugu, Tamil and Malayalam). In this paper, we present a novel script independent (for south Indian) skew estimation technique based on Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is used to learn the mixture of Gaussians. Subsequently the cluster means are subjected to moments to estimate the skew angle. Experiments on printed and handwritten documents corrupted by noise is done.

abstract={Pneumatic conveying systems are used to convey a wide range of materials in industries such as thermal power, metals, chemicals, food and glass. Research and development undertaken over the last few decades has helped engineers to design reliable and energy efficient systems for a wide range of conveying applications. Pneumatic conveying systems, like many other conveying systems, are prone to problems of component wear when abrasive materials have to be handled. This is particularly the case with regard to pneumatic conveying systems when operating in dilute phase suspension flow, as a consequence of the high conveying air velocities encountered. Pipeline bends are particularly vulnerable in this respect and can suffer rapid failure. As a consequence of the turbulence generated in bends, however, the straight sections of pipelines following bends are also at risk of failure due to erosive wear. The study presented reports on the erosive wear of straight pipeline sections following two different types of bend, with the influence of particle size, conveying air velocity and solids loading ratio being investigated.},

abstract={There has been a growing interest among the researchers in the area of soft computing assisted material modeling in general and modeling of concrete in particular. Their results look very promising. Concrete is a heterogeneous material with complex behavior and is not amenable for crisp mathematical predications. Most of the inferences regarding the material behavior are formulized after going through experimental results that consists of equipment imprecision, tolerances and human factor. The analytical modeling of concrete using traditional methods is arduous and not robust. Further, the mathematical models developed using traditional statistical methods are generally based on assumed relationships and do not have the true predicting capability outside the experimental domain used for their development. Unlike traditional parametric methods, the soft computing methods do not assume a relationship between various parameters and concrete performance. The relationship is rather generated from the experimental data provided to build and train the model. This paper makes a modest attempt to present an elaborative discussion on the applications of soft computing techniques in concrete technology and their advantages. The published research work pertaining to applications of constituents of soft computing in general and hybrid systems in particular are discussed. The paper concludes with a briefing on the contribution of authors in this area. Copyright © 2007 IICAI.},

abstract={Fiber reinforced polymer composites are known to generally possess high strength and attractive wear resistance in dry sliding conditions involving adhesion transfer or fatigue. How such composites perform in abrasive wear situations needs a proper understanding. Hence, in this study, three-body abrasive wear behavior of short glass fiber (SGF) reinforced polyurethane (PU) composite is investigated. Three-body abrasive wear tests are conducted using rubber wheel abrasion tester (RWAT) at two different loads (i.e., 22 and 32 N) and increasing abrading distances (i.e., 150, 300, 450, and 600 m) respectively. The wear results of the SGF/PU composites indicate that the wear volume increased with increase in fiber content for both increased load/abrading distance. However, the specific wear rate decreases with increase in load. The abraded surface features of the composites are studied by using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). © SAGE Publications 2007.},

abstract={Castor oil-based polyurethane (PU)-polyester nonwoven fabric composites were fabricated by impregnating the polyester nonwoven fabric in a composition containing castor oil and diisocyanate. The effects of different diisocyanates such as toluene-2,4-diisocyanate (TDI) and hexamethylene diisocyanate (HMDI) on the mechanical properties have been studied for neat PU sheets and their composites with polyester nonwoven fabric. Chemical resistance of the PU composites has been assessed by exposing the specimens to different chemical environments. Percentage water absorption of composites and neat PU sheets has been determined both at room temperature and in boiling water. Both TDI- and HMDI-based PU composites showed a marginal improvement in tensile strength retention at 100°C heat ageing. Water sorption studies were carried out at different temperatures, viz, 30, 50, and 70°C, based on immersion weight gain method. From the sorption results, the diffusion (D) and permeation (P) coefficients of water penetrant have been calculated. Attempts were made to estimate the empirical parameters such as n, which suggests the mode of transport (non-Fickian), and K, a constant which depends on the structural characteristics of the polymer in addition to its interaction in boiling water. The temperature dependence of the transport coefficients has been used to estimate the activation energy parameters for diffusion (ED) and permeation (Ep) processes from Arrhenius plots. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based polyurethane/polyacrylonitrile (PU/PAN, 50/50) semi-interpenetrating polymer network (SIPN) membrane has been studied from sorption/desorption cycles and diffusion behaviour with substituted aromatic probe molecules at 20, 40 and 60 °C. Sorption/desorption cycles have been repeated to evaluate polymer-solvent interaction. Organic solvents taken up or given out by IPN are measured periodically till equilibrium. Using these data, sorption (S), diffusion (D) and permeation (P) coefficients have been calculated from Fick's equation. Sorption data is correlated with solubility parameter of solvents and polymer. It was found that solvents of comparable solubility parameter with IPN interact more and thus there is an increase in sorption. Molecular mass between cross-link has been calculated using Flory Rehner equation. The cross-link density and degree of cross-linking of the membrane is calculated. From the temperature dependence of sorption and diffusion coefficients, the Arrhenius activation parameters like activation energy for diffusion (ED) and permeation (EP) processes have been calculated. Furthermore, the sorption results have been interpreted in terms of thermodynamic parameters such as change in enthalpy (ΔH) and entropy (ΔS). Concentration profiles of penetrants at different penetration depths in the polymer sample at different time intervals have also been calculated theoretically from a solution of Fick's equation under appropriate initial boundary conditions. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Small angle X-ray scattering data have been recorded for the blends of styrene butadiene, styrene copolymer/polyaniline using the beamline of the LNLS (Laboratorio Nacional de Luz sincroton-Campinas, Brazil). Employing one-dimensional Hosemann's paracrystalline model, we have simulated the meridional reflections of these blends in order to compute the long periodicity and hence to find the variation with concentrations of the blends. Within the region of available experimental data we observe that there is a linear relationship between long periodicity and concentration of blends. These parameters are compared with physical measurements like tensile strength to find the structure-property relation in these blends. © Indian Academy of Sciences.},

abstract={Whenever cement is left unused for a long time or improperly stored, it deteriorates. The degree of deterioration mainly depends on the duration and condition of storage. Due to this, cement partially or completely loses its engineering qualities. Even if such cement is only 10% of total 100 million tonnes cement produced in India, total quantity available for use would be in the range of 10 million tonnes. The aim of this study is to develop a stepwise procedure to proportion plain concrete mixes using partially deteriorated cement. Extensive laboratory studies are done to study the behavior of concrete with partially deteriorated cement. Conventional methods of mix design such as British Method, ACI and country's standard code can be used directly for concrete containing standard cement which satisfies prescribed specifications. When deteriorated cement is used these conventional methods of mix design fail as its physico-chemical interacting particulate characteristics would have been reduced to low levels. The re-proportioning of concrete mixes did not yield the required strength and workability when only deteriorated cement was used. However, the performance of the concrete could be improved by replacing a part of the deteriorated cement by fresh cement. As the fresh cement content increases, the strength and workability of the concrete also improved. Using these modified mixes, re-proportioning could be made for other levels of strength and even up to that of 100% fresh cement concrete. The procedure is validated through a series of experimental trials. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The first step in an automatic face recognition system is to localize the face region in a cluttered background and carefully segment the face from each frame of a video sequence. In this paper, we propose a fast and efficient algorithm for segmenting a face suitable for recognition from a video sequence. The cluttered background is first subtracted from each frame, in the foreground regions, a coarse face region is found using skin colour. Then using a dynamic template matching approach the face is efficiently segmented. The proposed algorithm is fast and suitable for real-time video sequence. The algorithm is invariant to large scale and pose variation. The segmented face is then handed over to a recognition algorithm based on principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis. The online face detection, segmentation, and recognition algorithms take an average of 0.06 second on a 3.2 GHz P4 machine.},

abstract={Woven glass fabric epoxy composite laminates were subjected to low velocity impacts in an uninstrumented drop weight tester, and the corresponding delamination areas traced. The compression strengths of the composite before and after the impact event were measured adopting a novel technique, consisting of tests on a scaled down version of the standard Boeing-CAI specimen, using a custom designed compression test fixture, in order to facilitate tests within the capacity of an available 100 kN testing machine. Experimental data showed that, as the incident impact energy (Ein) was increased from 10 J to 25 J, the delamination area (Adel) increased from 369 mm2 to 640 mm2, and the compression strength retained was in the range of 62.73% to 43.17% of its virgin strength. Further, a concept of ''Area Retention Factor'' has been introduced to explain the phenomenon causing the compression strength degradation (or its retention) in impact damaged composites. © SAGE Publications 2007.},

abstract={This paper presents an experimental investigation to advance a stepwise procedure to proportion plain and slag concrete mixes with burnt coal cinder waste as coarse aggregate. When typical strength of coarse aggregate in concrete is lower than the concrete strength required, conventional methods such as British Method, ACI and country's standard code cannot be used directly since failure of concrete is predominantly by aggregate crushing. To analyze the data, concrete, for simplicity, is regarded as two phase composite of cement mortar matrix and coarse aggregate. With the concrete and constituent cement mortar matrix strengths and their respective volume fractions as input parameters, the typical strength of coarse aggregate in concrete is determined from linear law of mixtures. Using again the same law, the cement mortar matrix strength required for higher or at par to that of the typical aggregate strength is calculated. To arrive at water-cement ratio for matrix strength, the Generalized Abrams' law is employed. © 2006 RILEM.},

abstract={Castor oil based polyurethane (PU)-polyester nonwoven fabric composites were fabricated by impregnating the polyester nonwoven fabric in a composition containing castor oil and diisocyanate. Composites were fabricated with two different isocyanates such as toluene-2,4-diisocyanate (TDI) and hexamethylene diisocyanate (HMDI). Transport behavior of n-alkane penetrants (pentane, hexane and heptane) into both PUs and PU-polyester nonwoven fabric composites were studied. Sorption studies were carried out at different temperatures. From the sorption results, the diffusion (D) and permeation (P) coefficients of penetrants have been calculated. Significant increase in the diffusion and permeation coefficients was observed with increase in the temperature of sorption experiments. Drastical reduction in diffusion and permeation coefficients was noticed in the composites compared to neat PUs. Attempts were made to estimate the empirical parameters like n, which suggests the mode of transport and K is a constant depends on the structural characteristics of the composite in addition to its interaction with penetrants. The temperature dependence of the transport coefficients has been used to estimate the activation energy parameter for diffusion (ED) and permeation (EP) processes from Arrhenius plots. Furthermore, the sorption results have been interpreted in terms of the thermodynamic parameters such as enthalpy (ΔH) and entropy (ΔS). © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The sorption data was used to fit six different sorption isotherm models proposed in the literature. The model constants were determined by linear fitting of the sorption equations. The ranges of applicability of water activity for the isotherm models reported in the article lies between 0.1 and 0.4 (monomolecular layer) for the Braunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) model, and between 0.3 and 0.9 (multimolecular and capillary condensation layers) for other models.

The effect of xanthan gum and plasticizers (propylene glycol and dibutyl phthalate) on the rate and amount of drug diffusion from PVA membrane across the hydrated cellophane membrane has been evaluated, using an open glass diffusion-tube. The obtained films were clear, smooth and flexible having sufficient mechanical strength. The mechanical performance of the dry PVA films with xanthan gum and plasticizers were also ascertained. Polyvinyl alcohol-xanthan gum blends showed a high rate of drug release compared to that of polyvinyl alcohol film alone. Among the two plasticizers employed, propylene glycol showed better permeability. Among different formulations studied, the formulation PVA/xanthan gum/propylene glycol (F7) was found to be an optimized composition for efficient transdermal delivery of the model drug, terbutaline sulphate. The mechanism of drug diffusion has been evaluated using the Peppas model.

Percentage water absorption of composites have been determined both at room temperature for 24 h and in boiling water for 2 h. Heat aging studies conducted at 150 and 200deg;C reveal that the composites have better dimensional stability at 150deg;C. The effect of salt water soaking at different temperatures viz., 30, 50, and 70deg;C on the mechanical properties, such as tensile strength, percentage elongation, and stitch tear strength has been studied. Vertical flammability test shows that the increase in the MF content has enhanced the flame resistance of the composites. The cyclic water-soaking test of the composites exhibits a reduction in thickness swelling with increase in the MF content in the system. © 2007 SAGE Publications.},

abstract={The molecular transport of substituted aromatic solvents through polyurethane/polystyrene (PU/PS, 50/50) semi interpenetrating polymer network has been investigated at 20, 40, and 60°C. Sorption-desorption-resorption- redesorption (S-D-RS-RD) experiments were performed to determine the true value of transport coefficients. Sorption results are obtained by a gravimetric method and diffusion coefficients have been calculated using Pick's equation for the linear data points of time dependent sorption/resorption curves. It was observed that most of the systems follow the Fickian mode of transport. The first order kinetic equation was used to estimate the kinetic rate constant of Sorption. Activation parameters for different transport processes were evaluated and the results were used to discuss the polymer-solvent interactions. The concentration profiles at different depths along the thickness of membranes and at different time intervals were computed using Fick's equation under appropriate boundary conditions. The rate of evaporation of liquids has been calculated for desorption and redesorption processes, and these results depend on the volatility of aromatic solvents. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The composites are characterized for physico-mechanical properties like density and tensile behaviour of the specimens before and after biodegradation. The positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) was used to monitor the content of free volume before and after biodegradation. The extent of degradation was examined by change in tensile behaviour and surface morphology. The influences of fungi on mechanical and morphological behaviour of filled IPNs are found to be interesting. The free volume changes in the composite systems correlates well with the mechanical properties. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Significant modifications have been made in many aspects of concrete mix design in the draft IS 10262 : 2004, which is currently being circulated by Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). The method proposed in the draft code can be used for the design of ordinary and standard concrete grades using concreting materials and other supplementary materials identified for this purpose. Here the mix proportioning is done for plain and rice husk ash (RHA) concrete. Two percentages of RHA namely 15% and 25 % as replacement to cement have been tried in this work. The investigation is only an attempt to demonstrate the use of draft code for the design of concrete that contains cement alone and a combination of cement and rice husk ash which is a supplementary cementing material.},

From the sorption results, the diffusion (D) and permeation (P) coefficients of water penetrant were calculated. A significant increase in the diffusion and permeation coefficients was observed with an increase in the temperature of sorption. Drastic reductions in diffusion and permeation coefficients were noticed with increasing MF content in the composites. Attempts were made to estimate the empirical parameters like n, which suggests the mode of transport, and K, a constant which depends on the structural characteristics of the composite in addition to its interaction with water.

abstract={The objectives of this research article is to evaluate the mechanical and tribological properties of glass-fiber-reinforced epoxy (G-E) composites with and without graphite particulate filler. The laminates were fabricated by a dry hand layup technique. The mechanical properties, including tensile strength, tensile modulus, elongation at break, and surface hardness, were investigated in accordance with ASTM standards. From the experimental investigation, we found that the tensile strength and dimensional stability of the G-E composite increased with increasing graphite content. The effect of filler content (0-7.5 wt %) and sliding distance on the friction and wear behavior of the graphite-filled G-E composite systems were studied. Also, conventional weighing, determination of the coefficient of friction, and examination of the worn surface morphological features by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were done. A marginal increase in the coefficient of friction with sliding distance for the unfilled composites was noticed, but a slight reduction was noticed for the graphite-filled composites. The 7.5% graphite-filled G-E composite showed a lower friction coefficient for the sliding distances used. The wear loss of the composites decreased with increasing weight fraction of graphite filler and increased with increasing sliding distance. Failure mechanisms of the worn surfaces of the filled composites were established with SEM. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The dynamic vulcanization decreased the PALS parameters because of the presence of the crosslinking both inside the rubber phase and, probably, at the interface. In spite of the significant difference in PALS parameters observed as a function of the vulcanization, the mechanical properties were similar for non-vulcanized and vulcanized blends of similar composition. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the specific wear rate decreases with increase in abrading distance and increases with the load. However, C-E composite showed better abrasion wear resistance compared to G-E composite. The worn surface features have been examined using scanning electron microscope (SEM). SEM micrographs of abraded composite specimens revealed the high percentage of broken glass fiber compared to carbon fiber and also better interfacial adhesion between epoxy and carbon fiber. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={A series of thermoplastic vulcanizates of polypropylene (PP)/nitrile butadiene rubber (NBR) (50/50) have been prepared by melt-mixing method, using phenolic resin/SnCl2 as the curing system and maleic anhydridefunctionalized PP (PP-g-MA) and carboxylated NBR (NBRE-RCOOH) as the compatibilizing system. Triethylenetetramine was also employed to promote the reaction between the functionalized polymers. The effects of curing agent and compatibilizer on the mechanical and morphological properties have been studied. A novel technique based on positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy has been used to measure the free volume parameters of these systems. The positron results showed minimum free volume size and free volume fraction at 5.0% of the curing agent suggesting some cross-linking in the rubber phase. The reduction in free volume holes at 2.5% of the compatibilizer is interpreted as improvement in the interfacial adhesion between the components of the blend. The observed variation of free volume fraction is opposite to the tensile strength and exhibits the correlation that, lesser the free volume more is the tensile strength at 2.5% of the compatibilizer in the blend. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Face detection (human) plays an important role in applications such as human computer interface, face recognition video surveillance and face image database management. In the human face detection applications, face(s) most frequently form an inconsequential part of the images. Consequently, preliminary segmentation of images into regions that contain "non-face" objects and regions that may contain "face" candidates can greatly accelerate the process of human face detection. Most existing face detection approaches have assumptions, which make them applicable only under some specific conditions. Existing techniques for face detection in colour images are plagued by poor performance in the presence of scale variation, variation in illumination, variation in skin colours, complex backgrounds etc. In this research work we have made a humble attempt to propose an algorithm for face detection in colour images in the presence of varying lighting conditions, for varied skin colours as well as with complex backgrounds. Based on a novel tangible skin component extraction modus operandi and detection of the valid face candidates, our method detects skin regions over the entire image and engenders face candidates based on the signatures of the detected skin patches. The algorithm constructs the boundary for each face candidate. Experimental results demonstrate successful face detection over a wide range of facial variations in colour, position, scale, varying lighting conditions, orientation, 3D pose, and expression in images from the database which is enriched with several photo collections (both indoors and outdoors with all the above mentioned extreme cases taken into consideration). In view of the capability to handle high degree of variability, that our approach can handle we articulate that our approach outperforms all the published popular methods (A comparison of which is given in Table 1). © 2006 IEEE.},

abstract={We propose a novel computationally efficient correspondence algorithm to identify the correspondence of similar features of the Reference frame to Search frame in the dynamic image sequence analysis for face tracking. The correspondence of the features between the set of images is the central problem in Computer Vision(CV), Image Analysis(IA) and Pattern Recognition(PR). In these areas Correspondence of features is the combinatorial explosion problem or NP-hard, because of their exhaustive searching for features in the sequence of image frames. This correspondence has three major steps such as segmentation, feature extraction and matching. In this paper we propose block-based segmentation in which the frame which contains the face to be track can be segmented as window of size 20*20 which covers the face. Here we consider the window trace mean is the feature since this is rotation invariant and it covers all the rows and columns of the window and it reduces the dimensionality and finally for matching we used the minimum absolute difference method which does not involves more computations since no multiplication operation is involved. We restrict the searching space to [-3,+3] pixels horizontally and vertically in the search image. Experimental results show that this novel algorithm could achieve much higher computational reduction as compared with full search (FS), Diamond search (DS)[6], Cross Diamond Search (CDS)[7,8] and Area Based Correspondence[14] algorithm for face tracking image sequence while similar prediction accuracy is maintained and it is especially suitable for video conferencing and slow moving dynamic image sequence. © 2006 IEEE.},

abstract={Fly ash is a common admixture used in concrete and may constitute up to 50% by weight of the total binder material. Incorporation of fly ash in Portland-cement concrete is highly desirable due to technological, economic, and environmental benefits. This article demonstrates the use of artificial intelligence neural networks for the classification of fly ashes in to different groups. Kohonen's Self Organizing Feature Maps is used for the purpose. As chemical composition of fly ash is crucial in the performance of concrete, eight chemical attributes of fly ashes have been considered. The application of simple Kohonen's one-dimensional feature maps permitted to differentiate three main groups of fly ashes. Three one-dimensional feature maps of topology 8-16, 8-24 and 8-32 were explored. The overall classification result of 8-16 topology was found to be significant and encouraging. The data pertaining to 80 fly ash samples were collected from standard published works. The categorization was found to be excellent and compares well with Canadian Standard Association's [CSA A 3000] classification scheme. © World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={Flexible manufacturing systems (FMS) have already proved their great success in a large number of manufacturing industries. Realizing the importance of FMS in increasing productivity, quality, the high investment and the potential of FMS as a strategic competitive tool makes it attractive to engage in research in this area. Scheduling of flexible manufacturing systems (FMSs) has been one of the most attractive areas for both researches and practitioners. A considerable body of literature has accumulated in this area since the late 1970s when the first batches of papers were published. A number of approaches here been adopted to schedule FMS. The FMS scheduling problem has been tackled by various traditional optimization techniques and non-traditional approaches. The traditional method can give an optimal solution to small-scale problem; they are often inefficient when applied to larger-scale problem. The non-traditional approaches such as genetic algorithm generate optimal schedule to large-scale problems. Articles emphasizing many methodological perspectives are critically reviewed. The review is done from multiple viewpoints covering different approaches like simulation, artificial intelligence and genetic algorithm. Comments on the publications and suggestions for research and development are given. A comprehensive bibliography is also presented in the paper. Copyright © 2006 by ASME.},

abstract={Pitman Shorthand Language (PSL) is a phonetic based language developed in 1837 to translate speech into text. Recognition of text recorded in PSL is an interesting research problem. The PSL has the practical advantage of high speed of recording, more than 120-200 words per minute, because of which it is universally acknowledged. This recording medium has its continued existence inspite of considerable developments in speech processing systems, which are not universally established yet. In order to exploit the vast transcribing potential of PSL a new area of research on automation of PSL processing is conceived. In this work, we have proposed the secant based method for recognition of PSL characters. The work comprises of preprocessing such as thinning and filling, determination of end points of the handwritten strokes. Slope of the strokes are determined using end points of the stroke. Characters are classified based on the estimated slopes of secants and other features such as stroke type and thickness. The vowels are classified based on the vowel type such as dash or dot and thickness and position with respect to a stroke. The proposed work is thoroughly tested for a large number of handwritten strokes. The recognition rates are estimated and found to be in the range of 60 to 95 %. © 2006 IEEE.},

abstract={Medical imaging plays a vital role in current clinical practice and biomedical research. Medical imaging has gone through a revolution since the advent of X-ray computed tomography imaging in early seventies and the introduction of other imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, etc in the later years. In many image analysis tasks, frequently a problem arises when images taken at different times or from different viewing points need to be compared. Image registration is a fundamental task in many modern image processing and computer vision tasks. The combination of more advanced and user friendly image acquisition, 3D image displays, medical image databases have contributed to the recent developments of medical image registration techniques in the areas of nuclear medicine, along with the early applications of CT-MRI registration and PET-MRI registration. This paper attempts to summarize the importance of medical image registration with primary focus on present capabilities and possible future advances.},

abstract={Electrically conductive blends based on polyaniline-dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid (Pani.DBSA)/styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS) block copolymer have been prepared in the presence of different plasticizers such as dioctyl phthalate (DOP) and cashew nut shell liquid (CNSL). The products were characterized by ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectrometry, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and resistivity measurements. The presence of DOP resulted in an increase of the electrical resistivity whereas the increasing concentration of CNSL resulted in a decrease of electrical resistivity. In the latter case, the presence of cardanol, a phenol-type compound in CNSL, may be responsible for the improved electrical performance, probably because of a secondary doping process, which changes the molecular conformation of Pani.DBSA chains from "compact coil" to "expanded coil". In addition, CNSL contributes to the formation of cocontinuous-type morphology with conducting pathways in larger extension. EPR studies also showed an increase of the polaron mobility as the amount of CNSL in the blend increases. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

A marginal improvement in tensile strength and tensile modulus is observed with increase in high modulus fiber. Wear resistance is increased with the increase in rigid glass fiber content in the nylon matrix. The dimensional stability of the composite is improved with the increase in fiber content. The acoustic behavior of these composites has been measured using acoustic emission technique.

The effect of different pickup ratio (dry, wt/wt) of NBR latex to jute nonwoven fabric, viz., 0.5:1, 1:1.5, 1.5:1, 2:1, and 2.5:1 on the water absorption behavior of the composites were evaluated. Water absorption studies were carried out at different temperatures, viz. 30, 50, and 70°C, based on immersion weight gain method. From the sorption result, the diffusion (D) and permeation (P) coefficients of water penetrant have been calculated. Significant increase in the diffusion and permeation coefficients was observed with increase in the temperature of sorption experiments. Drastic reductions in diffusion and permeation coefficients were noticed with increase in the pickup ratio of NBR on to jute nonwoven fabric. Attempts were made to estimate the empirical parameters like n, which suggests the mode of transport, and K is a constant that depends on the structural characteristics of the composite in addition to its interaction with water. The temperature dependence of the transport coefficients has been used to estimate the activation energy parameter for diffusion (ED) and permeation processes (Ep) from Arrhenius plots. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Soil plasticity characteristics obtained from laboratory tests are reasonable for use only when the testing procedures adopted to determine them measure the factors responsible for the soil plasticity. It is shown that this is the case with the percussion method of liquid limit determination and the 3 mm thread rolling method of plastic limit determination. Further, it is also shown that the results obtained from the cone penetration method cannot represent the soil plasticity fully, as the mechanisms that come into play during testing relate to undrained strength due to both undrained cohesion and undrained friction. It is stressed that the percussion and 3 mm thread rolling methods must be the only ones used to determine the plasticity of soils. The circumstance under which the cone penetration method can be used is also indicated. © 2006 NRC Canada.},

abstract={Decolorization of distillery effluents, using low cost polymer adsorbents, is one of the challenging areas for environmental technologists. Untreated distillery effluents are harmful to the environment, causing foul smell, spoiling fresh water sources and killing aquatic life. The color of distillery effluents have been decolorized by using polymer based adsorbents, such as poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) and cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP), which are water insoluble, easily available, and cheap. In the present article, special emphasis is given to studies such as the effect of contact time, dosage amount, dilution, and the variation in the amount of sample on the degree of decolorization of the effluent. The decolorization of a distillery effluent was monitored by using UV/Visible spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). From these studies, it was noticed that moderate to fair results were obtained and it was also found that CAP was a better adsorbent, compared to PVC, for decolorization of distillery effluents.},

abstract={This paper deals with the development of an indexing scheme for categorising fly ashes. The indexing is mainly based on eleven attributes that include physical, chemical and morphological characteristics which play an important role in the performance of fly ash concrete. The application of radial basis function network permitted to differentiate three main groups of fly ashes. The so formed groups were then correlated with their performance in high volume fly ash concrete system. About 80 sets of data pertaining to fly ashes were collected from standard published results. The radial basis function network with a Gaussian function has been used for classification. Sufficient data is being used for the training set and test set. The categorisation was found to be excellent. The weight matrix was used to develop an equation for indexing. With the indexing equation and known attribute values of a given fly ash, it would be possible to provide quick information about the fly ash properties and its possible application.},

abstract={A series of composites was fabricated by impregnating jute nonwoven fabric in a bath of acrylonitrile-butadiene (NBR) latex. Thermogravimetric analysis of the jute, NBR and their composites were performed in order to establish the thermal stability and mode of thermal degradation. Thermal degradation of the jute fabric and composites was found to proceed in two steps, unlike NBR. All the composites were stable to 280°C. A degradation kinetic parameter was obtained for each stage of degradation of the jute, NBR and their composites, using Broido, Coats-Redfern and Horowitz-Metzger methods. The activation energy (Ea) of the composites for the thermal degradation process lay in the range 39-129, 35-130 and 20-142 kJ/mol for the Broido, Coats-Redfern and Horowitz-Metzger method respectively. Cryogenically fractured specimens were used to analyse the surface morphology of the jute fabric and composites by scanning electron microscopy. © Rapra Technology, 2006.},

abstract={Most of the existing soil classification systems make use of the plasticity chart for classifying fine-grained soils and some coarse-grained soils as well. They cannot classify those granular materials that are non-plastic through appropriate group symbols indicative of their non-plastic nature without any ambiguity. Coal ashes, consisting of fly ash (known as pulverised fuel ash in the UK), bottom ash and pond ash, are produced in large quantities and are occasionally used in geotechnical applications. As they are non-plastic materials, the existing classification systems fail to classify them appropriately. This paper discusses this issue in detail. A classification system for coal ashes that are essentially non-plastic is formulated and proposed in this paper. It is shown through illustrative examples that the coal ashes can be classified easily and without any ambiguity using the proposed system.},

abstract={There are practical situations, wherein to meet the demands on precast industry, normal curing of concrete cannot be carried out. The question addressed in this paper is as to how the effects of loss of strength due to terminated curing can be circumvented in practical cases to restore normal strength development. Since the loss of water in the system is inevitable due to terminated curing, to attain the same value of gel space ratio the possibility to reduce the space created due to initial water added has been resorted to. The laboratory test results on strength developed at a specific age with normal curing and terminated curing of a trial mix with water-cement (w/c) ratio of 0.5 and water content of 190 l/m 3 form the input data. To obtain strength values of normal curing, the strength values of terminated curing are adjusted by reproportioning method in which the required w/c ratio is calculated using generalised Abrams' law. This computed mixture is the practical field mix to be adopted which ensures normal strength development despite curing getting terminated at a specified period. The proposed reproportioning method is simple. However, there are certain limitations with regard to the reproportioned mixes about quality of hydrated gel from durability conditions, risk of higher shrinkage and creep, etc and these have also been highlighted at the end. Further, work needed to overcome these limitations is also mentioned.},

abstract={Present study deals with the adsorption of phenol on carbon rich bagasse fly ash (BFA) and activated carbon-commercial grade (ACC) and laboratory grade (ACL). BFA is a solid waste obtained from the particulate collection equipment attached to the flue gas line of the bagasse-fired boilers of cane sugar mills. Batch studies were performed to evaluate the influences of various experimental parameters like initial pH (pH0), contact time, adsorbent dose and initial concentration (C0) on the removal of phenol. C0 varied from 75 to 300 mg/l for the adsorption isotherm studies and the effect of temperature on adsorption. Optimum conditions for phenol removal were found to be pH0 ≈ 6.5, adsorbent dose ≈10 g/l of solution and equilibrium time ≈5 h. Adsorption of phenol followed pseudo-second order kinetics with the initial sorption rate for adsorption on ACL being the highest followed by those on BFA and ACC. The effective diffusion coefficient of phenol is of the order of 10-10 m2/s. Equilibrium isotherms for the adsorption of phenol on BFA, ACC and ACL were analysed by Freundlich, Langmuir, Temkin, Redlich-Peterson, Radke-Prausnitz and Toth isotherm models using non-linear regression technique. Redlich-Peterson isotherm was found to best represent the data for phenol adsorption on all the adsorbents. The change in entropy (ΔS°) and heat of adsorption (ΔH°) for phenol adsorption on BFA were estimated as 1.8 MJ/kg K and 0.5 MJ/kg, respectively. The high negative value of change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG°) indicates the feasible and spontaneous adsorption of phenol on BFA. The values of isosteric heat of adsorption varied with the surface loading of phenol. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Efficient resource discovery and indexing is the assured way to provide low cost customized resource retrieval service in a mobile ad hoc environment. We present a novel resource discovery mechanism for MANETs that uses Routing Intelligent Mobile Agents(RIMAs). RIMAs periodically collect routing and resource availability information and index the same in capable RIMA nodes. At least one local RIMA node is known to other mobile nodes. The mobile node running an application in need of a resource dispatches a ResourceDiscoverer agent to its nearest RIMA node. The index available at the RIMA node will guide the ResourceDiscoverer to the Data Container node. The method has been simulated and tested on MANETs of varying sizes from 50 to 800 nodes. Simulation snapshots and results show the proper working and success of the algorithm. © 2005 IEEE.},

abstract={Pattern recognition is characteristic to all living organisms. The object which is inspected for the "recognition" process is called a pattern. Medical diagnosis is an example of pattern recognition problem. By knowing a "KNOWN" we can eliminate all the "UNKNOWNS" in the parasitic sample. The objective of this work is to match parasites of same type but with approximately different shape. One should be able to recognize the parasites of same type even if there is slight variation in their shape. In our work we match different types of parasites by checking their pixel values and their continuity. It is often useful to have a machine perform pattern recognition. In particular, machines that can read parasites are very cost effective. A machine that reads the type of parasite can detect many more parasites than a human being at the same time. Application of this nature optimizes the time and enhances the matching accuracy. To the best of our knowledge much work is not reported in the field of matching the parasites. © 2005 IEEE.},

abstract={There is currently no well-tried mix proportioning methods available for slag concrete. Presently this supplementary cementitious material is being used widely in India in almost all fields of construction, as it is a cheaper material. The use of such mineral admixture is also recommended in IS: 456-2000. This paper presents a simple method to produce concrete having a 28-day compressive strength varying from 30 MPa to 60 MPa at different percentages of slag namely 30%, 60% and 90% as a replacement to cement. Though the strength of slag concrete decreases as the slag content increases, it is found that the slag concrete possessed significant compressive strength even at higher replacement levels. Concrete mixes are designed for three exposure conditions as per IS: 456-2000 satisfying the durability requirements. Their compressive strength characteristics are reported in this paper. Mix design procedure suggested in the draft IS: 10262(2003) is adopted.},

The mechanical properties of the blends have been evaluated according to the (ASTM) standard. The positron results indicate that the mechanical properties like tensile strength and surface hardness have a significant dependence on the free volume of the blends. It is also found that the blends of the present study show positive deviation from the familiar linear additivity rule suggesting the immiscible nature of the blends. Further, up to 5-wt% of PMMA in the blend, an increase in relative fractional free volume correlates well with a decrease of tensile strength. © 2005 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.},

abstract={In this experimental investigation, a practical rapid method of proportioning steel fibre reinforced concrete (SFRC) mixes is developed and validated. The basis for developing this is to use the reproportioning method, which has already been developed for proportioning normal density cement concrete mixes, for SFRC mixes. Based on the results of the trial mix, two SFRC mixes having 28 day target strength of 30 and 50 MPa are designed using this technique and examined regarding its validation. In addition, the impact resistance of these reproportioned Plain Concrete (PC) and SFRC is studied at 7 and 28 days. It is observed that the SFRC has developed significant impact resistance even for a small addition of steel fibres. Pulse velocity test is conducted at different ages to assess the quality of concrete. It is found that all concrete specimens could be classified under good quality. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={The sorption-desorption-resorption-redesorption experiments have been conducted to evaluate the transport behaviour of polyethylene glycol (PEG) based polyurethane/polymethyl methacrylate (PU/PMMA, 50/50) semi interpenetrating polymer network (SIPN) with aromatic probe molecules. Molecular migration depends on the nature of the organic solvent, membrane-solvent interaction, temperature, solubility parameter, molecular volume and free volume available within the polymer matrix. The transport parameters like sorption (S), diffusion (D) and permeation (P) coefficients have been calculated for IPN-aromatic probe molecule systems. Sorption and diffusion results measured at different temperatures viz. 20, 40 and 60 °C are found to follow Fickian mechanism. The liquid concentration profiles in the membranes during sorption and resorption processes have been simulated by solving Fick's diffusion equations and by using numerical method. Equilibrium swelling results have been used to measure the molecular mass between cross links, degree of cross linking and cross link density using Flory-Rehner theory. It is found that the mass uptake values decreased with increase in cross link density during polymer-solvent interactions. The estimated Arrhenius activation energy for diffusion (E D) and permeation (EP) are indicative of nature of liquid and their interaction with membrane. Thermodynamic parameters like change in entropy (ΔS) and enthalpy (ΔH) have been calculated using van't Hoffs equation. The rate of evaporation of liquids have been calculated for desorption and redesorption runs, and these results depend on volatility of solvents. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The chemical modification of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) resins with hexamethylene diisocyanate and toluene diisocyanate was achieved. The reaction of LDPE with diisocyanate was monitored by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, wherein the appearance of new peaks at 3326, 1620, and 1572 cm-1 corresponding to - N - H stretching, - (C=O)-NH2 stretching, and - N - H bending in an amide moiety, respectively, was observed. Modified films of excellent clarity and uniform thickness were obtained by the solution casting of crosslinked polyethylene. The oxygen transmission rate (OTR), water vapor transmission rate (WVTR), grease resistance, and thermal properties of the modified films were studied. The results clearly indicate that the OTR was improved by 35% and that grease resistance was improved by 90-125% in the crosslinked LDPE films with little change in their strengths. The heat seal characteristics, however, showed that relatively higher temperatures were needed to achieve efficient sealing in these films. Differential scanning calorimetry showed a decrease in the melting temperature from 104°C for LDPE to 101°C for both of the crosslinked LDPE films. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Spatial clustering, which groups similar spatial objects into classes, is an important component of spatial data mining [Han and Kamber, Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques, 2000]. Due to its immense applications in various areas, spatial clustering has been highly active topic in data mining researches, with fruitful, scalable clustering methods developed recently. These spatial clustering methods can be classified into four categories: partitioning method, hierarchical method, density-based method and grid-based method. Clustering large data sets of high dimensionality has always been a serious challenge for clustering algorithms. Many recently developed clustering algorithms have attempted to address either handling data with very large number of records or data sets with very high number of dimensions. This new clustering method GCHL (a Grid-Clustering algorithm for High-dimensional very Large spatial databases) combines a novel density-grid based clustering with axis-parallel partitioning strategy to identify areas of high density in the input data space. The algorithm work as well in the feature space of any data set. The method operates on a limited memory buffer and requires at most a single scan through the data. We demonstrate the high quality of the obtained clustering solutions, capability of discovering concave/deeper and convex/higher regions, their robustness to outlier and noise, and GCHL excellent scalability. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={In summary, the discusser would like to state that the liquid limit, which is a water-holding capacity of fine grained soils, cannot be correlated with shear strength, which goes against the basic philosophy behind the very definition of the plasticity characteristics of soils. The plasticity index determined based on strength tests, without giving due regards to the controlling mechanisms and clay mineralogy of soils, cannot be regarded as the plasticity characteristic of the soil. At best, it can remain just as a difference between two arbitrary water contents determined from two strength-based tests, the corresponding strengths, namely 1.7 kPa and 170 kPa, being arbitrarily fixed without any rationale. The plasticity index that is widely used in current geotechnical engineering practice is also not an exception to this statement. The constructive research in the field of geotechnical engineering should focus its attention toward determining the value of the plasticity index more rationally, that represents the real plasticity characteristic devoid of its existing limitations, and should not blindly support the empirically determined arbitrary quantities on the pretext that they are already in wide usage. © ASCE.},

abstract={The process capability analysis helps in quantifying the process variability and assists manufacturing by reducing the variability. Process capability of a manufacturing process can be assessed through the computations of various process capability ratios. The usual method of process capability analysis involves large Computations and requires more time. The usual method of process capability analysis uses range and average range, which is more sensitive and affects by fluctuation of sampling and is not a stable measure of dispersion. Quartile Deviation (QD) based process capability approach can be used to compute capability ratios. Quartile deviation can be obtained graphically. This graphical approach of the process capability study is more rigid, consumes less time and has its own advantages over traditional method and gives quick information for further computation and analysis. The limitations of usual method of process capability analysis can be overcome by using quartile deviation based analysis. Using the quality characteristic of observations draws the cumulative frequency curve and hence Median and Quartile deviation is obtained. The traditional grand mean computations are replaced by median. Quartile deviation is used to compute process standard deviation through empirical relation.

abstract={This paper presents a modification to the incremental learning algorithm originally proposed by Bernd Fritzke.This algorithm is a single stage approach to build a RBF neural network in the training phase. It combines the unsupervised and supervised learning stages to incrementally generate the RBF architecture. The algorithm uses accumulated error information to insert new neurons dynamically in the hidden space. The algorithm maintains constant parameters to control the growth of the network. This may result in non-optimal architectures. Modifications that provide adaptive capabilities to the learning parameters have been proposed in this work. Two benchmark data sets have been used for training. Results show an improved performance over the original incremental learning algorithm. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004.},

abstract={There are several different types of information inherent in audio conversations: speech features, participants, and content. If an organization were able to collect all the relevant conversations of its employees, high-potential collaborations and expertise can be identified [1]. VoIP has been off late an effective voice application on Internet/LAN for communication. VoIP can also be a potential source of collaboration for an organization provided privacy concerns are properly managed. The progress in speech/speaker recognition technologies can help in the practical implementation of a VoIP collaborator for effective knowledge management. In this paper, we propose an object-oriented architecture for Information gathering tool for a SIP/RTP based VoIP collaborator that has open architecture for integration of knowledge management tools. The implementation of the proposed architecture is presented with test implementation on Linux operating system. The privacy management for addressing privacy concerns is also incorporated. © 2004 IEEE.},

Two aspects of model testing are given importance, namely manual shaking table and laminar box. Design, development, calibration and performance of these equipments are described. Model testing is the essential requirement of earthquake geotechnical engineering that helps in understanding the behaviour of geotechnical facilities and their performance during earthquake. Manual shaking table developed very economically can be used as an alternative to a more sophisticated shaking table. Laminar box is a sophisticated container which can enhance the accuracy in assessing the ground behaviour. Some of the important calibration techniques necessary are also discussed.},

abstract={Antifriction bearing failure is a major factor in failure of rotating machinery. As a fatal defect is detected, it is common to shut down the machinery as soon as possible to avoid catastrophic damages. Performing such an action, which usually occurs at inconvenient times, typically results in substantial time and economical losses. It is, therefore, important to monitor the condition of antifriction bearings and to know the details of severity of defects before they cause serious catastrophic consequences. The vibration monitoring technique is suitable to analyze various defects in bearing. This technique can provide early information about progressing malfunctions. This paper describes the suitability of vibration monitoring and analysis techniques to detect defects in antifriction bearings. Time domain analysis, frequency domain analysis and spike energy analysis have been employed to identify different defects in bearings. The results have demonstrated that each one of these techniques is useful to detect problems in antifriction bearings.},

abstract={The present study deals with the performance evaluation of the UASB reactor under varied organic loading rate(OLR) for the treatment of paper mill wastewater. The sludge granulation process started after 120 days from the start-up period. Sludge granules size was found to be 0.8 mm at OLR of 1.72 kgCOD/(m3·d), which reached maximum size of about 1.0 to 1.2 mm at OLR of 2.1 kgCOD/(m3·d . At the end of initial OLR of 1.0 kgCOD/(m3·d) the VSS concentration was 12.86 gVSS/L, which got increased to 38.05 gVSS/L at the end of an OLR 2.1 kgCOD/(m3·d) . Most of the times VFA recorded were well within the limit of VFA reported in anaerobic fermentation process. Many times the pH observed was between 6.5 and 7.8, which is more favorable for any anaerobic process. It is also found that pH within the reactor increases along with the height of reactor. The total maximum biogas production was found to be 0.40 L/gCOD removals at OLR of 2.1 kgCOD/ (m3·d) and the maximum BOD removal at this stage was observed to be 90%.},

abstract={A series of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/starch films were cast by the solvent method. Mechanical, optical, wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS), and biodegradation studies of starch-filled PVA films were carried out. With the addition of starch there was an increase in haze and diffusion of light, whereas there was only slight change associated with tensile behavior and burst strength of the PVA film. Microstructural parameters, such as crystal size (<N>) and lattice distortion (g, in %) were estimated using one-dimensional Hosemann's paracrystalline model along with WAXS data. These parameters quantify the changes in the PVA/starch systems, which resulted in the observed physical properties.},

abstract={The Rural Water Supply and Sanitation (RWSS) in project and non-project villages of Mysore Taluk has been evaluated and discussed in this paper. The study area covered two villages (Yelwala and Kadakola) where Integrated Water Supply Scheme (IRWSS) was implemented under World Bank Project and two non-project villages (Belwadi and Byathahalli) closer to them. Pre and post scenarios of the project and non-project villages were investigated in terms of water quality analysis and also grading of villages has been done on the basis of water supply, sanitation, hygienic awareness and practices. Matrix methodology was used to evaluate the indicators from the survey data gathered from all studied villages. Finally, the villages were graded on the basis of cumulative value obtained for each village. Water quality analysis depicted turbidity, total dissolved solids and hardness being high and iron deficiency was also observed in water samples of all the villages. It was concluded that the present method of evaluation of rural water supply and sanitation project could be effectively applied to different upcoming projects.},

abstract={Tool wear is one of the major obstacles for achieving automation in manufacturing processes. The condition of the tool has a considerable impact on the quality of the work piece machined It also may damage the machine tool; increase rejects and also machine downtime. There is a need to intelligently control the tool condition by monitoring the same using different methods, so that the tool can be replaced at the right time to assure cutting reliability and system reliability. There are various approaches for monitoring the condition of the tool and can be classified as direct and indirect. Indirect approaches are more tenable for intelligent control and involve measurement of various signals, which have a correlation with the tool condition and include signals like acoustic emission, vibration signal, cutting force etc. There is a need for fast and accurate recognition, differentiation or grouping of the various response signals collected at the proper time intervals during the machining process for monitoring the same, Artificial Neutal Networks (ANN) have been applied widely to monitor many complicated machining processes like turning, mulling, drilling and grinding. In this paper, a critical evaluation of the performance of different neural network architectures like Multi-Layer Perceptron, Radial Basis Function Networks, Resource Allocation Network(RAN) and Growing Cell Structures Network(GCSN) have been presented for tool wear monitoring in face milling operations. To the authors' knowledge, it is the first time that both RAN and GCSN are explored and exploited in the application of tool wear monitoring during milling operations. Acoustic Emission (AE) and Surface Roughness signals have been used to formulate the data set for training and testing the network.},

abstract={Wastewater emanating from color photograph processing units is usually in small quantities (5-20 L per day) and contains high concentrations of recalcitrant organic compounds. Disposal of such highly recalcitrant wastewater into a public sewer may result in an inhibiting effect on biological treatment system of a sewage treatment plant and thus these persistent organics can escape to receiving water bodies. A continuous full-scale treatment unit for such a small quantity of wastewater is not a viable option, economically and technically. In this study, a small batch type of an electrochemical reactor has been utilized to investigate the feasibility of electrochemical treatment of wastewater from a color photograph processing unit. The treatability studies were conducted using cast iron electrode. It was found that the cast iron electrode was efficient in removing both chemical oxygen demand and biochemical oxygen demand to the levels that meet the standards for discharge to surface water and public sewer. The energy consumption to meet the standards for sewer disposal was less compared to that of surface water disposal. The electrochemical reactor was found to be cost effective in both installation and operation for meeting the sewer disposal standards. It was concluded that the wastewater could be partially treated (pretreatment) electrochemically to meet the standard for sewer disposal rather than that of surface water disposal.},

abstract={The methylene diisocyanate (MDI) and toluene diisocyanate (TDI) based polyurethane/polybutyl methacrylate (PU/PBMA-50/50) interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) membranes have been prepared. The molecular migration of n-alkane penetrants such as hexane, heptane, octane, nonane, and decane through PU/PBMA (50/50) membranes has been studied at 25, 40, and 60°C using a weight gain method. From the sorption results, diffusion (D) and permeation (P) coefficients of n-alkane penetrants have been calculated. Molecular migration depends on membrane-solvent interactions, size of the penetrants, temperature, and availability of free volume within the membrane matrix. Attempts have been made to estimate the parameters of an empirical equation and these data suggest that molecular transport follows Fickian mode. From a study of temperature dependence of transport parameters, activation energy for diffusion (ED) and permeation (EP) have been estimated from the Arrhenius relation. Furthermore, sorption results have been interpreted in terms of enthalpy (ΔH) and entropy (ΔS) of sorption. The liquid concentration profiles have been computed using Pick's equation with appropriate initial and boundary conditions.},

abstract={The sorption and diffusion of halogenated hydrocarbon penetrants through different ethylene-propylene-diene terpolymer (EPDM) blends, such as EPDM/natural rubber, EPDM/bromobutyl rubber, and EPDM/styrene butadiene rubber (50/50 w/w), were studied. The diffusion coefficient of halogenated penetrants fell in the range 1.5-14.52 × 10-7 cm2/s in the temperature range of 25-60°C. Transport data were affected by the nature of the interacting solvent molecule rather than its size and also by the structural variations of the EPDM blends. 1,2-Dichloroehane showed a lower mass uptake compared to other penetrants. The temperature dependence of the transport coefficient was used to estimate the activation parameters, such as the activation energy of diffusion (ED) and the activation energy of permeation (Ep) from Arrhenius plots. The activation parameters for ED of aliphatic chlorinated organic penetrants was in the range 7.27-15.58 kJ/mol. These values fell in the expected range for rubbery polymers, well above their glass-transition temperature. Also, the thermodynamic parameters, such as enthalpy and entropy, were calculated and fell in the range 2-15 kJ/mol and 3-54 J/mol/K, respectively. Both first- and second-order transport kinetics models were used to investigated the transport kinetics, and first-order kinetics were followed.},

abstract={The treatment of biologically treated wastewater of coffee-curing industry by the electrochemical oxidation using steel anode was investigated. Bench-scale experiments were conducted for activated sludge process on raw wastewater and the treated effluents were further treated by electrochemical oxidation method for its colour and organic content removal. The efficiency of the process was determined in terms of removal percentage of COD, BOD and colour during the course of reaction. Several operating parameters like time, pH and current density were examined to ascertain their effects on the treatment efficiency. Steel anode was found to be effective for the COD and colour removal with anode efficiency of 0.118 kgCOD-h-1·A-1·m-2 and energy consumption 20.61 kWh-kg-1 of COD at pH 9. The decrease in pH from 9 to 3 found to increase the anode efficiency from 0.118 kgCOD-h-1·A-1·m-2 to 0.144 kWh-kg-1 of COD while decrease the energy consumption from 20.61 kWh-kg-1 of COD to 12.86 kWh·kg-1 of COD. The pH of 5 was considered an ideal from the present treatment process as it avoids the addition of chemicals for neutralization of treated effluents and also economical with respect to energy consumption. An empirical relation developed for relationship between applied current density and COD removal efficiency showed strong predictive capability with coefficient of determination of 96.5%.},

abstract={This paper presents an extension to the constructive learning Tower Algorithm for multicategory classification. The Tower algorithm proposed by Stephen Gallant [1] is one of the constructive learning algorithms for building a neural network during the training phase. Constructive learning algorithms are shown to be more robust since they build optimal neural network architectures. Gallant's Tower algorithm basically performs two category classifications. Extensions to the two category Tower algorithm for multi category classification is straightward. It can be accomplished by adding a layer of M neuroos each time a new layer is added to the tower. The constructive Tower algorithm develops an architecture which could form the basis for incremental learning where new data is learnt without forgetting the prior knowledge. This feature makes it suitable for on-line applications. Different variations of the Tower algorithm for multi category classification are presented and observations discussed. © 2003 IEEE.},

These sheets were characterized by electrical, physico-mechanical, thermal, X-ray and morphological studies. All electrical properties of EVA-(PAni)TSA blends increased with an increase in PAni content. The conductivity, dielectric constant and tan δ values increased from 1.34 × 10-14 to 2.89 × 10-2 S/cm, from 2.113 to 19.845, from 0.094 to 4.789. Tensile strength increased with an increase in PAni content up to 7% and drastically decreased above 15%, while the percentage elongation at break decreased with an increase in PAni content. TGA studies revealed that the thermal stability of PAni improved after blending with EVA. EVA-PAni blends were found stable up to 110°C. X-ray diffractograms of EVA-PAni blend showed an intense peak at 26° (2θ), reflecting the influence of EVA crystallinity. Scanning electron micrographs confirmed the two-phase morphology of the system.},

The transport behaviour of carbonyl penetrants like aldehydes; formaldehyde, benzaldehyde, acetaldehyde and ketones; methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), cyclohexanone and acetophenone through EPDM, SBR and their blends have been studied by immersion weight gain method. Transport data are affected by the nature of interacting solvent molecule rather than its size and also by the structural variations of blends. Attempts were made to estimate system parameters like n., which suggests the mode of transport and K is a constant depending on the structural characteristics of the polymer in addition to its interaction with the solvent. The values of n lie in the range 0.48-0.71, which suggests that the molecular transport is of Fickian mode. The diffusion co-efficient of all membranes (D) for aldehydes and ketones falls in the range 0.51-3.10 × 10-7cm2/s and 0.27-6.02 × 10-7 -7cm2/s respectively at the temperature range 25-60°C. Effect of temperature on sorption (S), diffusion (D) and permeation (P) coefficients were also studied. The temperature dependence of the transport coefficients has been used to estimate the activation parameter for diffusion process (ED) from the Arrhenius plots. Thermodynamic parameters such as enthalpy (ΔH) and entropy of sorption (ΔS) have been calculated. Concentration profiles for all the elastomeric membrane-carbonyl penetrants have been computed using a Fickian equation for the appropriate initial boundary. © 2011, by Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co.

A hypothesis has been proposed in this investigation to explain this deviation according to which the permeability of the exit layer controls whether the measured permeability is greater or lesser than the theoretically calculated value. The proposed hypothesis has been used to successfully and satisfactorily explain the experimental observations made with the two-layer systems. It has been shown that the coefficient of permeability of a soil in a layered system cannot be considered as its property and that it depends upon the permeabilities of adjoining layers, their thicknesses, and the flow direction.},

About 56% of COD and 84% of BOD removal was observed at 3.5A current for 5h of electrolysis. The effect of increase in surface area of anode reduces electrolysis time and also energy consumption per kg of COD removal. The treated effluent was subjected to chemical coagulation studies using Ca(OH)2 as coagulant. The final treated effluent was found to confirm the stipulated standards for safe disposal into surface water bodies (Indian Standards).

abstract={Monitoring the condition of the cutting tool in any machining operation is very important since it will affect the workpiece quality and an unexpected tool failure may damage the tool, workpiece and sometimes the machine tool itself. Advanced manufacturing demands an optimal machining process. Many problems that affect optimization are related to the diminished machine performance caused by worn out tools. One of the most promising tool monitoring techniques is based on the analysis of Acoustic Emission (AE) signals. The generation of the AE signals directly in the cutting zone makes them very sensitive to changes in the cutting process. Various approaches have been taken to monitor progressive tool wear, tool breakage, failure and chip segmentation while supervising these AE signals. In this paper, AE analysis is applied for tool wear monitoring in face milling operations. Experiments have been conducted on En-8 steel using uncoated carbide inserts in the cutter. The studies have been carried out with one, two and three inserts in the cutter under given cutting conditions. The AE signal analysis was carried out by considering signal parameters such as ring down count and RMS voltage. The results show that AE can be effectively used to monitor tool wear in face milling operation.},

abstract={In recent years, through the process of intensive research, considerable progress has been made in area of automatic face recognition systems wherein computers can assist humans in many face recognition tasks. An automatic face recognition system reduces human intervention force and also removes the monotony factor and is perfectly suited for law enforcement activities like surveillance and general monitoring of public areas. This paper presents a novel and feasible method of implementing the face recognition technique based on eigenfaces. The method is intuitive, simple to express in mathematical terms, and flexible. Here we create a database of images and train these faces using the eigenface method to recognize a given face in the database. Another case, where the input image is non-facial is identified using our reconstruction algorithm developed. We applied preprocessing algorithms like smoothing transformation mean fdtering, back ground elimination and local enhancement filter to bring the images in the database and the probe image into a standard, recognizable format. Based on its ability to distinguish between different faces, the system showed a maximum recognition rate close to 90%. The relationship between recognition accuracy, scale and rotation was also investigated. © 2002 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper describes an approach of using genetic algorithms (GAs) for image segmentation. The approach proposes to solve the problem based on the idea of using genetic programming to discover effective problem-specific fitters capable of highly and selectively emphasizing some characteristics of the image. Genetic Algorithms work on the principle of simulation of the evolution of individual structures via processes such as selection, mutation, and reproduction. Implementation of image segmentation using GAs involves identifying a suitable binary coding strategy, defining a fitness evaluation function, designing a 'population' (set of chromosomes), defining genetically inspired operators such as crossover and mutation to evolve new population and deciding the termination if the evolutionary search for the optimal solution. Segmentation is a non polynomial type of problem. This paper describes the use of genetic algorithms in the randomized search of solution to the segmentation problem, with the initial population built using the state space techniques and then evolved using genetic operators and the fitness function. Accuracy of the results is found to vary with the fitness function. The result is got in the binary form due the coding strategy adapted. A mask is then implemented to extract and reconstruct the segmented image from the original image. © 2002 IEEE.},

The Japanese Geotechnical Society sent a small reconnaissance team to the damaged region after the quake. The present text presents the report from this activity. The major attention of the team was focused on geotechnical aspects of the damage which were related to earthfill dams and harbor land fills. It was found that a significant portion of damage was concentrated in fills resting on soft natural soils. Swedish weight soundings which were conducted at two places demonstrated the existence of such a soft subsoil. From this, it was concluded that amplification of earthquake shaking as well as the permanent deformation in the soft foundation soil induced such kinds of damage as subsidence, cracking, and lateral spreading in overlying artificial fills. For the better seismic resistance of those affected fills during future earthquakes, the improvement of soft subsoil seems essential.},

abstract={An integral part of concrete mix proportioning is the preparation of trial mixes and making adjustments to such trials striking a balance between the requirements of placement, strength, and durability. When coarse aggregate characteristic strength is lower than the levels of strength of the concrete desired, different methods, viz., British, ACI, and the country's standard code, cannot be used directly. In this paper a generalized method is advanced to proportion concrete using quarry wastes, namely, cuddapah and marble in concrete, as coarse aggregate. Concrete is regarded as a composite of cement mortar matrix and coarse aggregate. The basic principle of the method is to assess the characteristic strength of coarse aggregate from compressive strength data of concrete failed by aggregate fracture and from that characteristic strength to assess the cement mortar strength required so as to ensure the development of the required strength of concrete. To arrive at the exact water-cement ratio of mortar matrix, the generalized Abrams' law is used.},

abstract={The frequency modulation (FM) technique is proposed for the operation of voltage source static inverters. In conventional pulse width modulation (PWM) techniques the magnitude of carrier frequency and its multiples are significantly high. In the sine PWM method, at 0.5 modulation index the fundamental is 50% and the carrier component is more than 100% in magnitude of the supply voltage. The ratio of the carrier to fundamental magnitude increases further with reduction of the modulation index. Voltage source inverters having low- and medium-speed static switches use carrier frequency in the audio frequency range, resulting in acoustic noise. Also, if the carrier frequency is maintained low as in ac drives, the high magnitude of carrier may produce significant unwanted torques. These problems of conventional PWM technique may be reduced significantly by using frequency modulation in which the carrier is distributed within a defined band. A generalized mathematical model of frequency modulation technique is presented for static converters. The proposed technique also allows transition from frequency modulation to conventional PWM method if necessary. The performance of the proposed FM modulator is compared with the conventional PWM used in the control of static PWM converters. Simulation and experimental results are presented to validate the claims.},

abstract={Reinforced concrete (RC) corbels are finding extensive applications in precast industries. A simple design and construction procedure to produce safe and economical corbels is therefore required. Thirty RC corbels were cast and tested to cover wide range of strength from 40 to 70 MPa. The parameters considered in the study were shear span-to-depth (a/d) ratio, which varied from 0.5 to 2.5 and the strength of concrete. The main objective of the present experimental work is to study Hagberg's truss analogy within the frame work of the limit state of design as per IS 456 : 2000. The results are compared with the recently proposed softened strut and tie model by Shyh et al. The corbels are also designed as per ACI 318 approach and the results are presented from the point of view of comparison. It has been observed that design procedure within the framework of the limit state method proposed for Hagberg's truss analogy model predicts not only safe and economical but also conservative results.},

abstract={A series of ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer-polyaniline (EVA-PAn) blends with different weight ratios of PAn were obtained by mechanical blending using plasticorder. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) studies of the blends were performed in order to establish the mode of their thermal degradation. The TGA thermograms showed that the thermal degradation of EVA-PAn blends was found to proceed in three steps except in the case of EVA-PAn (90/10) blend system. Degradation kinetic parameter was obtained for each stage of thermal degradation of blends, using Broido and Coats-Redfern methods. The activation energy (E) of the blends for the thermal degradation process lie in the range of 3.3-95.6 kJ/mol and of 9.6-135.0 kJ/mol for Broido and Coats-Redfern methods, respectively. The surface morphology of the EVA-PAn blends was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) before and after thermal treatment. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

The primary objective of the present experimental investigation is to study the behaviour of steel fibre reinforced concrete (SFRC) cube in a splitting test. Equations are proposed, based on the linear regression analysis, to correlate splitting tensile strength with the fibre reinforcing index. Linear relations between the splitting tensile strength and the flexural tensile strength, and splitting tensile strength and compressive strength are also proposed. The experimental data provides an encouragement for a wider acceptance of this testing method, as it is a reliable and an economical test for determining the tensile properties of SFRC.},

abstract={An analytical study of nonlinear fracture of beams using a blunt crack model is presented. The fracture is modeled by a blunt front smeared over an elastic layer around the midsection of the beam. Outside the elastic layer, the deformations are modeled by beam theory. From the knowledge of the uniaxial stress-strain relation including the postpeak softening portion, calculations are presented for the determination of moment- curvature and load-deflection relations. A generalized power law (with an exponent n) has been used for the postpeak stress-strain relation. It is shown that, for a linear postpeak relation (n = 1), the equations coincide with those described when using the fictitious crack model with a linear stress-displacement law in the softening portion. Results for both the blunt crack model and the fictitious crack model are compared for nonlinear softening relations. Calculations are given for the critical brittleness factor from the snapback considerations for the beam. A method of determining n and the elasticity coefficient of the central layer k from an experiment is outlined.},

Fusarium solani fungal species tend to remove 90% Cu++ from solution in the alkaline pH range of 8.0 - 10.0. Contact time studies indicate higher sorption of Cu++ by Fusarium solani species. The linear fit of the Lagergren plot justify the authenticity of the kinetic data.

abstract={Elevated levels and cumulative application of nutrients from uncontrolled urban storm water runoff induce weed and algal growth in lentic and lotic water bodies. Storm water runoff has been characterized for specific nutrients viz., PO42- and TKN for two urban microcatchments (MC1 and MC2) of Mysore City; 16 storm events have been monitored for the estimation of nutrients for a period of one year. Storm water characterization reveals high nutrient concentrations during the initial flush of the storm event. The PO42- concentrations of 17.75 mgL-1 (MC1) and 16.25 mgL-1 (MC2) are much higher than desired; TKN values of 1.30 mgL-1 (MC2) are within limits. Relating storm events with nutrient concentrations seem to be difficult due to the highly dynamic factors operating in urban land use. Storm water harvesting and removal of limiting nutrients from urban runoff are among the promising solutions in regulating the entry of nutrients into water bodies.},

Although the use of other biometrics like retinal patterns and fingerprints are quite prevalent, they are not simple methods. With the development of very handy digitizer tablets, signatures can be captured on-line and can be processed for verification. Since signatures of the same person can vary with time and state of mind, it is necessary to develop an efficient signature verification system. We propose a signature verification system which extracts certain dynamic features derived from velocity and acceleration of the pen together with other global parameters like total time taken and number of pen-ups. The features are modeled by fitting probability density functions, i.e., by estimating the mean and variance, which could probably take care of the variations of the features of the signatures of the same person with respect to time and state of mind. © 2001 IEEE.},

abstract={Sedimentary soils are formed due to the process of settling of soil particles in suspension. The settling process is physico-chemical in nature as the soil contains chemically active clay minerals. The extent to which the clay mineralogy affects the settling process depends upon the initial water content of the soil-water suspension. For montmorillonitic soils, the limiting water content at which the nature of settling changes from a discrete free type to a flocculated free type increases with an increase in the soil plasticity and decreases with an increase in the soil plasticity for kaolinitic soils. While the diffuse double layer repulsion controls this kind of behaviour of montmorillonitic soils, the behaviour of kaolinitic soils can be attributed to the fabric effect.},

abstract={A micro-controller-based retort control system for sterilization of foods was developed. The feature of this developed control system is that actual container cold point temperature is sensed on real time basis using temperature sensors. The on-line temperature is further processed using software to determine the sterilization value in terms of Fo and is continuously displayed. The sterilization process is controlled until the set Fo value is attained and at the end of the heating process cooling is automatically started. This ensures commercial sterility leading to higher nutrient retention and savings in energy by avoiding overcooking. This system can be easily incorporated onto the existing manually controlled batch retorts - horizontal or vertical. The system is more economical than the large sophisticated computer controlled systems presently available. It is mainly aimed at small and medium scale food processing industries having manually operated batch retorts.},

The compression curve obtained with its origin at the settling limit water content of the soil is the stress-free reference state curve as well as the upper bound compression curve for the homogeneous soil sample.},

abstract={The ever-increasing demand for the use of marginal lands for various human activities necessitates the need to understand the behavior of soft sediments under the action of external forces. As the segregated sediments are of common occurrence in a freshwater depositional environment, it is essential to understand the compressibility and permeability characteristics of segregated sediments, in addition to those of homogeneous sediments. The present paper discusses the compressibility and permeability behaviors of soft segregated and homogeneous sediments, making use of a simplified seepage consolidation testing procedure developed by the authors. The other variables included in the study are the clay mineralogy of the soil and the stress history of the sediments. The study clearly brings out the significant effect of clay mineralogy on the compressibility characteristics of segregated, normally consolidated sediments. The compressibility behavior of homogeneous soil sediments formed under a given depositional environment, having different clay mineralogy, appears to be similar. It is shown that the coefficient of permeability of any soil is a function of stress history in addition to void ratio and soil type.},

abstract={Ways are explored to increase the life and to reduce the cost of tyre-curing bladders by improving their mechanical and ageing properties. Nine formulations have been designed which involve the partial replacement of polychloroprene (PC) and castor oil (CO), both individually and simultaneously, by chlorinated paraffin (CP) in the butyl bladder compound. The compounds have been tested for various cure properties such as initial torque, minimum torque, scorch time, optimum cure time, cure rate, maximum torque and reversion time. The vulcanized samples have been tested for mechanical properties such as tensile stress at 300% elongation, tensile strength at break, ultimate elongation, rubber deterioration by dynamic fatigue test and Shore-A hardness before and after ageing. The results show that tensile strength at break and ultimate elongation decrease, while tensile stress at 300% elongation increase except in one case (when PC was partially replaced by CP). Simultaneous and individual replacement of CO by CP results in a decrease in hardness of up to 3 phr (base recipe CO 5 phr), whereas further replacement of CO by CP results in an increase in hardness. Tensile stress at 300% elongation and Shore-A hardness increase up to a limit while tensile strength at break and ultimate elongation decrease with ageing.},

Tensile strength and percent elongation lies in the range 13-24 MPa and 76-32, respectively. Higher tensile strength was observed for 4,4′-diaminodiphenylsulphone (DDS) than the 4,4′-diaminodiphenylmethane (DDM) chain extender. The properties imparted by the extenders are explained on the basis of the groups present in the diamines. These changes have been interpreted quantitatively in terms of microcrystalline parameters computed using wide-angle X-ray scattering data.},

abstract={The mechanisms controlling the liquid limit of montmorillonitic and kaolinitic soils are different. The observation that the liquid limits obtained by both the conventional percussion method and the cone penetration method differ quite appreciably from each other at low and high plasticity ranges indicates that the mechanisms dominating the two testing procedures are different. The analysis of the results obtained from the present experimental investigation, and the results available in the literature prove that the viscous shear resistance primarily controls the percussion method of testing, and that the frictional shear resistance dominates the cone method of testing. Since the viscous shear resistance is primarily due to the double-layer held water, which is characteristic of montmorillonitic soils, and the liquid limit of montmorillonitic soil is primarily governed by the diffuse double layer thickness, the percussion method is well suited to montmorillonitic soils. Likewise, as the interparticle frictional resistance is due to the mode of particle arrangement in addition to mineral frictional characteristics, and the same primarily controls the liquid limit of kaolinitic soils, the cone method suits kaolinitic soils better.},

abstract={Most of the national codes of practice do not give characterization and classification of expansive soils, in spite of expansive soils being distributed very widely over almost all geographical locations in the world, causing distress to the structures founded on them and discomfort to the users. A simple user-friendly approach based on the free swell ratio, defined as the ratio of the sediment volume of soil in distilled water to that in carbon tetrachloride or kerosene, is formulated considering the compatibility of the results with oedometer free swell tests and the soil clay mineralogy. Statistical illustrations are provided which clearly indicate that while the assessment of soil expansivity based on index properties is an overestimation, there is a consistency in the classifications based on oedometer test results and the proposed approach. It is recommended that simple approaches such as the one proposed here to classify the expansive nature of soils are entered into standard codes of practice.

A simple user-friendly approach based on the free swell ratio, defined as the ratio of the sediment volume of soil in distilled water to that in carbon tetrachloride or kerosene, is formulated considering the compatibility of the results with oedometer free swell tests and the soil clay mineralogy. Statistical illustrations are provided which clearly indicate that while the assessment of soil expansivity based on index properties is an overestimation, there is a consistency in the classifications based on oedometer test results and the proposed approach. It is recommended that simple approaches such as the one proposed here to classify the expansive nature of soils are entered into standard codes of practice.},

abstract={The rapid advancement of the computer industry has led to computerization of various fields throughout the world, including India. Great emphasis is given to facilitate the users to interact with the computers in their local languages. Users will be more comfortable to input the instructions by their handwriting rather than through the existing local languages-converted-English keyboards. Since Kannada language is very rich in alphabet, for keying-in most of the Kannada characters, a combination of key strokes has to be used in such converted keyboards. This is very tedious and requires considerable practice and effort. An obvious solution is to input the instructions by handwriting. This paper reports the details of an on-line character recognition system for the Kannada characters developed by the authors that extracts the novel wavelet features from the contour of character written using a digitizer tablet pen. The conventional feedforward multilayer neural network is used as classifier. The results obtained are most encouraging and the system can be extended to other similar Indian languages, particularly, Telugu. © 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Groundwater is regarded to be the most valuable resources. Groundwater quality is affected by virtually every activity of the society thereby making groundwater protection complicated. The protection of groundwater is always cheaper than restoring already polluted aquifer. DRASTIC index methodology helps in the assessment of groundwater pollution potential. DRASTIC index uses a set of seven hydrogeological parameters viz., D-depth to Groundwater table; R-recharge due to rainfall; A-aquifer media; S-soil media; T-topography; I-impact of vadose zone; C-hydraulic conductivity. These parameters are weighed with respect to their relative importance. All the DRASTIC parameter layers in spatial formats are put into GIS. The layers were assigned weights and ratings and they are combined interactively in the computer system. The DRASTIC index map was generated on a minute grid and seven categories of groundwater pollution potential zones were identified. The Drastic Index represents the relative measure of groundwater pollution potential, which helps planners and administrators in broadly screening areas for waste disposal sites. Pollution potential map also helps in evaluating alternatives for directing the financial resources and land use activities to the appropriate areas. © 2000 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.

abstract={Most of the techniques used in the literature in clustering symbolic data are based on the hierarchical methodology, which uses the concept of agglomeration or division as the core of the algorithm. The main contribution of this paper is to formulate a clustering algorithm for symbolic objects based on the gravitational approach. The proposed procedure is based on the physical phenomenon in which a system of particles in space converge to the centroid of the system due to gravitational attraction between the particles. Some pairs of samples called as mutual pairs, which have a tendency to gravitate toward each other, are discerned at each stage of this multistage scheme. The notions of cluster coglomerate strength and global coglomerate strength are used for accomplishing or abandoning the process of merging a mutual pair. The methodology forms composite symbolic objects whenever two symbolic objects are merged. The process of merging at each stage, reduces the number of samples that are available for consideration. The procedure terminates at some stage where there are no more mutual pairs available for merging. The efficacy of the proposed methodology is examined by applying it on numeric data and also on data sets drawn from the domain of fat oil, microcomputers, microprocessors, and botany. A detailed comparative study is carried out with other methods and the results are presented. © 1999 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper addresses the problem of color image restoration, distorted by intra- and inter-channel blur, and corrupted by additive noise. The image is modeled as Markov random field, and color image restoration is cast as a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation problem. We propose a first-order interchannel interaction model for restoration. We compare this model with the results when interaction is not considered. The proposed model is fairly general, and the results are satisfactory even when interchannel degradation parameter is unknown.},

abstract={The adsorption of Colour Tannin on Industrial Grade Granular Activated Carbon (IGGAC) and Activated Coconut Shell (ACS) has been investigated. Due to the effect of agitation in batch reactors, percent removal increases with increase in adsorbent dose providing greater net adsorption sites for adsorption; Beyond a specific Dose, removal efficiency decreases/attains a constant value irrespective of the adsorbent Dose. The reaction is pH dependent with maximum adsorption range lying between 3.0 to 4.5 for ACS and 5.5 to neutral pH for IGGAC respectively. An early colour removal by IGGAC is observed with time as compared to ACS. Freundlich Static Isotherm Model is found applicable to Tannin - IGGAC and Tannin - ACS system. The values of adsorption capacity (k(f)) and intensity (1/n) for Tannin - ACS system are found to be 6.8000 and 0.5556 respectively. Similarly their values for Tannin - IGGAC system are found to be 2.600 and 0.8100 respectively. The results indicate ACS having a better adsorption capacity than IGGAC. Column studies indicate better colour removal at lower flow rates and the data had a reasonable fit to the Langmuir equation with (Q0) and (b) values 0.896 and 0.305 respectively while the dimensionless constant separation factor (R(L)) is 0.21.},

A new top-down technology mapper algorithm is discussed in this paper which aims at minimizing number of LUTs needed for mapping the digital circuit. The algorithm makes use of combination of node selection and covering heuristics using which maximum number of DAG nodes are covered by a selected LUT. The results obtained are better than Chortle, Level-map and Flow-map-r technology mapper algorithms.},

Normally the selection is based on the current fitness of the individuals, evaluated by a fitness function. However, the present fitness of an individual need not always indicate its ability to improve further. In this work, we propose an A∗ like evaluation method, which takes into account not only the present fitness of the individual, but also an estimate of its scope for further improvisation. This simple improvement to simple GA has produced results comparable to specialised GA methods in selection problems. © 1999 IEEE.},

The mechanism controlling the undrained shear strength behaviour of soils is a function of clay mineralogy of the soils. The present investigation proposes two mechanisms to explain the contradictory behaviour of kaolinitic and montmorillonitic soils under undrained conditions. The undrained shear strength of kaolinitic soils is a result of the net attractive forces and the mode of particle arrangement as governed by the interparticle forces, whereas that of montmorillonitic soils can be attributed to the viscous shear resistance of the double-layer water. The validity of the proposed mechanisms is confirmed by the results of the present investigation and those in the literature.

A series of interpenetrating polymer networks (PU/PS IPNs) were obtained as tough films by casting in glass moulds.

For this purpose on-line assessment is needed to evaluate the impacted system components in a short time. Fast evaluation of a disturbance impact requires the formulation of dynamic equivalence of external systems. On the other hand preventive measures for stability enhancement requires apriori knowledge of the components that are going to be affected by the disturbance. This paper presents the identification of coherent generators in power systems using an unsupervised learning neural network called `Growing Self Organizing Feature Map' which dynamically generates the network architecture. The data for the neural network has been obtained from the simulation of a 1000 Bus, 62 Generator system.},

abstract={Many research references are available to solve the conventional Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). A recent heuristic approach, GENI, by Michel Gendreau et al.1 is said to provide path efficient solutions. Our present paper proposes a novel strategy called FANI (Farthest neighbour nearest insertion) which tackles the twin issues of the algorithm performance namely, path efficiency and time efficiency. It is demonstrated through extensive experimentation that our method is better than GENI1. To solve a conventional TSP, this paper proposes a two-phase approach. In the first phase, farthest neighbour concept is adopted, and an initial tour spanning through three farthest neighbours is constructed. In the subsequent phase, the remaining vertices are inserted, one at a time, considering the nearest neighbour concept. Further, it is proposed to extend this strategy to solve a more pragmatic TSP, a problem in which the vertices are not dimensionless as often dealt in literature, but they have spatial spread, as found in several situations. The vertices may have lengthwise and/or breadthwise stretches (spread). Such points can be identified as spatially spread vertices (SSV) since such SSVs provide entry-exit options. Solving such TSPs becomes more complicated, and it is this issue which is taken up in this paper, and to the best of our knowledge such a problem has not been dealt in the TSP literature.},

abstract={The paper describes a neural network and expert system model for conflict resolution of unconstrained handwritten numerals. The basic recognizer is the neural network. It solves most of the cases, but fails in certain confusing cases. The expert system, the second recognizer, resolves the confusions identified by the neural network. The neural network classifier is a combination of Modified Self-Organizing Map (MSOM) and Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ). The experiments are conducted on Self-Organizing Map (SOM), MSOM, and the combinations of SOM & LVQ and MSOM & LVQ techniques. These experiments on a database of unconstrained handwritten samples show that the combination of MSOM & LVQ achieves satisfactory results in terms of classification, recognition and training time. The results obtained from this two-tier architecture are compared with the comments collected from an experiment conducted with a group of human experts specialized in unconstrained handwritten character recognition. The developed system is found to be useful in resolving conflicts in the recognition of Unconstrained Handwritten Numerals of PIN or ZIP codes of mailing addresses.},

The concept of fuzzy set theory helps us in resolving impreciseness present in the data. The proposed algorithm involves four stages; data reduction, computation of seed points, estimation of number of classes, and classification. In data reduction, the remotely sensed data is converted in to symbolic form using fuzzy ∝ - cut technique, which minimizes computation time and memory. Computation of seed points and estimation of number of classes uses farthest membership function and fuzzy measure respectively. In the final stage, the remotely sensed data is classified using fuzzy equivalence relation. The classification results of remotely sensed data of IRS 1B LISS II image of Nagarhole forest, India is encouraging. The results signify that the algorithm is efficient with less computational time and less memory.},

abstract={Fuzzy interpretations of data structures are a very natural and intuitively plausible way to formulate and solve various problems such as uncertainty, vagueness, decision making etc. A nonparametric hierarchical fuzzy classification for the satellite data is proposed. Incorporation of symbolic data analysis to multispectral data is helpful in data reduction and feasible to represent the complex description. Hence, remotely sensed data is converted in to symbolic form. Subjective similarity to each pair of symbolic objects is computed to perform classification. The proposed algorithm has two stages. In the first stage, multispectral data is converted into symbolic form. The second stage involves classification of symbolic objects using fuzzy equivalence relation. Equivalence relation is found using transitive closure for the distance computed between pair of symbolic objects. Distance is computed with a modified distance measure, which handles the quantitative interval type of data. The classification results of the IRS -1B satellite data covering Hyderabad city, India is encouraging. The results confirms that the algorithm is efficient with less computational time, less memory and to classify sharp boundaries.},

abstract={The performance of Genetic Algorithms hinges on the choice of “eligible parents” for carrying the genetic information from one generation to the next. Several methods have been proposed to identify the most promising mating partners for the continuation of the progeny. We propose, in this paper, a measure of dissimilarity between individuals to be considered along with their actual fitnesses. This would help the emergence of more combinations of chromosomes within the population so that at least a few are better. The more is the dissimilarity between the parents, the better are the chances of producing.fit children. After the problem introduction, we draw an analogy from biology to illustrate that the method should really work, then proceed with the implementation details and discuss the results. Apparently the philosophy of this paper contradicts some of the views held in connection with niche and speciation, where breeding within the community is preferred. However the issues involved are different and this aspect is dealt with in detail elsewhere in the paper. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1998.},

abstract={This paper discusses the theory and design of a 'self-basing logarithmic weir,' the discharge through which, for all flows above a threshold depth d, is proportional to ln (αhR/d) [hR is the depth of flow measured above a datum d/α below the weir crest and α, a constant [selected any value in the range 0 &lt; α ≤ 0.4 ] ], within a prefixed percentage deviation from the theoretical discharge. The significant feature of this weir is that it is defined by a single profile which is achieved by utilising the continously decreasing and fast converging characteristics of the function defining the quadratic weir in a special form. A portion of the weir above the crest acts as the base weir, over which the proportionality law holds. An interesting feature of this weir is that, its width almost tends to zero corrected to the third decimal place above a certain height, converting the weir into a proportional orifice, giving another example of a notch-orifice. Experiments with two typical weirs confirm the theory by giving a constant coefficient of discharge of 0.63. The application of this weir in hydraulic and irrigation engineering, and also in orifice gauging tanks is highlighted.},

abstract={Fuzzy interpretations of data structures are a very natural and intuitively plausible way to formulate and solve various problems such as uncertainty, vagueness, decision making etc. The concept of Fuzzy set theory without a priori assumption is used to devise a novel algorithm to carry out Fuzzy symbolic classification of remotely sensed data (IRS 1B Satellite). The proposed algorithm involves two stages. In the first stage, we will convert the data in to symbolic form, which involves data reduction followed by a new concept of finding the number of classes in the data based on the farthest neighbor index. In the second stage, fuzzy descriptions on symbolic objects of remotely sensed data is developed using membership function. Membership function is calculated using seed points determined from the farthest neighborhood concept instead of usual fuzzy means. Further classification is done, using fuzzy membership value. The classification results of IRS 1B satellite data covering Hyderabad City is encouraging. Results signify that Fuzzy classification is more logic and more powerful than hard classification.},

The results show that as the corundum content is increased, the hardness and the wear resistance increase remarkably, whereas the fracture toughness drops significantly. It was found that just a minute amount of corundum is sufficient to cause a fairly large change in these mechanical properties. The hardness of the material is also affected significantly by the aging time. Moreover, if other factors are kept constant, hot extrusion improves both its hardness and its wear resistance, whereas the fracture toughness is decreased.},

abstract={Many scientific techniques were used in sericulture research and rapid progress in their methodologies can aid in solving various complex situations associated with sericulture systems. Management of pests in sericulture is one such typical situation which requires more advanced computer technologies, such as expert systems and simulation models. Understanding the concept of pest management in sericulture with an appropriate expert system simulation model (ESSM) is important because of the fundamental impact of its complexity on production systems. With suitable unified ESSM technique, many difficult problems involved in management of pests in sericulture can be solved. In this article we review some suggestions and guidelines for such model developers.},

abstract={A nonparametric, hierarchical, divisive clustering algorithm based on mutual nearest neighborhood concept is proposed for classification of large volume of multispectral data indenting minimum memory and computational time. To realise the reduction of memory and computational time requirements, we define an Area of Interest around each pixel to search the required k nearest neighbors necessary for initiating splitting operation. We have proposed a modified distance measure, which incorporates the relative position of the pixels together with their feature values in order to improve the performance of the algorithm and reduce the classification error rate. The algorithm is simple, noniterative and can be successfully applied on any image data. Simulation experiments are conducted to corroborate the efficacy of the proposed methodology in terms of time, space and error rate.},

Studies were conducted using beds of small (average particle diameter less than 1 mm) sand particles and of large (average particle diameter greater than 1 mm) particles (raagi, mustard, millet and coriander). The fin pitch varied from 0.8 to 5.0 mm and the fin height varied from 0.69 to 4.4 mm. The tube pitch ratios used were 1.75 and 3.5. The influence of bed particle diameter, fluidizing velocity, fin pitch, and tube pitch ratio on average heat transfer coefficient was studied. Fin pitch and bed particle diameter are the most significant parameters affecting heat transfer coefficient within the range of experimental conditions. Bed pressure drop depends only on static bed height. New direct correlations, incorporating easily measurable quantities, for average heat transfer coefficient for finned tube bundles (in-line and staggered) are proposed.},

In conventional data analysis, the samples are described by feature vectors of numeric type. However, more generalized description of samples contain interval type of features and qualitative features. Such a description of samples constitute symbolic data. A modified new Similarity measure which takes into consideration the Position, Span and Content of symbolic objects is proposed. The Similarity measure used is of new type. The modified Similarity measure is used for obtaining the samples of the condensed set. The performance of the proposed modified CNN rule is illustrated by an example.

Laboratory studies were conducted to delineate the efect of parameters on uptake of Hexavalent Chromium and the kinetics of adsoprtion of Cr+6 removal. Parameters evaluated include, pH, size of adsorbent, time of contact and initial adsorbate concentration. Equilibrium studies indicate that the process obeyed Langmuir isotherm. However, Freudlich isotherm was used to predict the ultimate sorption capacity. The results indicate that the pongamia pinnata shell can be very effectively, efficiently and economically used to remove Cr +6from the industrial wastewaters in avidic range. (pH 2.0).},

abstract={This paper presents the design and development of a partially intelligent mobile platform. The mobile robot derives its intelligence from sensors such as ultrasonic range finders, a mouse and a set of microswitches. Motion is assumed to bee on a plane two dimensional surface. The platform consists of two front wheels and two rear wheels. While the front wheels are undriven, the rear wheels are individually driven by two motors to realize both forward movement as well as steering. Ultrasonic range finders have been employed to plan an obstacle free path. A mouse like arrangement is fitted in the platform's underside, with the mouse ball in contact with the surface of travel, to help the host to keep track of the platform's current position. A single chip microcontroller based card has been designed for communication between the platform and the host IBM PC. This is part of the work carried out at the department of Electronics, S.J.

The Dimensionality Reduction scheme involves transformation of data from multi-dimensional n-space to a two-dimensional (2D) space, which reduces storage requirements and processing time in addition to facilitating representation in the Cartesian coordinate system.

The similarity measure used is of a new type in the sense that it is not just another aspect of dissimilarity such as the reciprocal of a distance measure. The clustering methodology forms composite symbolic objects using a Cartesian join operator when two symbolic objects are merged. The maximum and minimum similarity values at various merging levels enable the determination of the number of clusters in the data set. The composite symbolic objects representing different clusters give a description of the resulting classes and lead to knowledge acquisition. The algorithm appears very versatile as it is capable of discerning clusters in data sets made up of numeric as well as symbolic objects consisting of different types and combinations of qualitative and quantitative feature values.

abstract={A new scheme, incorporating dimensionality reduction and clustering, suitable for classification of a large volume of remotely sensed data using a small amount of memory is proposed. The scheme involves transforming the data from multidimensional n-space to a 3-dimensional primary color space of blue, green and red coordinates. The dimensionality reduction is followed by data reduction, which involves assigning 3-dimensional samples to a 2-dimensional array. Finally, a multi-stage ISODATA technique incorporating a novel seedpoint picking method is used to obtain the desired number of clusters. The storage requirements are reduced to a low value by making five passes through the data and storing necessary information during each pass. The first three passes are used to find the minimum and maximum values of some of the variables. The data reduction is done and a classification table is formed during the fourth pass. The classification map is obtained during the fifth pass. The computer memory required is about 2K machine words. The efficacy of the algorithm is justified by simulation studies using multispectral LANDSAT data. © 1984.},

abstract={The concept of a "mutualistic teacher" is introduced for unsupervised learning of the mean vectors of the components of a mixture of multivariate normal densities, when the number of classes is also unknown. The unsupervised learning problem is formulated here as a multi-stage quasi-supervised problem incorporating a cluster approach. The mutualistic teacher creates a quasi-supervised environment at each stage by picking out "mutual pairs" of samples and assigning identical (but unknown) labels to the individuals of each mutual pair. The number of classes, if not specified, can be determined at an intermediate stage. The risk in assigning identical labels to the individuals of mutual pairs is estimated. Results of some simulation studies are presented. © 1979.},
