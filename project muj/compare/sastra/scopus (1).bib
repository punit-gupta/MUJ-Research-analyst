abstract={In India cements manufacturing industries are the second largest industry, giving more market share and in the increasing trend. Infrastructures and investments in the construction of buildings in India are growing exponentially. Indian government has boosted the growth of cement sales and industries to increase the economy growth. During non monsoon seasons, the growth becomes doubled compared with the monsoon period between April- June 2016, Deccan cement has got 80.70 %sales and Heidelberg cement has got the low sales 34.22 % sales. In 2016- 2017 increased cement price in North -10 %, centralregions-7%. At that time price of the cement were slashed down to Rs 320 per bag from Rs 400-420 per bag. In the monsoon period the production of the cement has increased, so that to meet their demands in the non monsoon periods. Cyclone tropical monsoon has got a greater impact in the manufacturing of cement. To measure the intensity of the cyclone during the monsoon season has proposed using Hyper graph, Dvorak Technique and Cyclone images. © TJPRC Pvt. Ltd.},

abstract={The structural stability and electronic properties of silicane nanoribbon (SiNR) and silicane nanoring (SiNRG) are studied using density functional theory method. The formation energy of SiNR and SiNRG confirms the stable structure. The formation energy for SiNR and SiNRG is found to in the range of −3.33 to −3.80 eV. The adsorption properties of NH 3 molecules on SiNR and SiNRG are explored in terms of adsorption energy, natural bond orbital analysis, energy gap and average energy gap variation. The adsorption energy is observed to be in the range of −0.60 to −0.71 eV, which clearly confirms the adsorption of NH 3 molecules on silicane nanostructures. The change in the electron density along SiNR and SiNRG is observed upon adsorption of NH 3 molecules. The density of states spectrum shows variation in the peak maxima upon adsorption of NH 3 molecules on SiNR and SiNRG base material. The transfer of electrons takes place upon adsorption of NH 3 molecules on SiNR and SiNRG. Moreover, the substitution of phosphorus on SiNR and SiNRG shows enhanced adsorption of NH 3 molecules. The findings suggest that SiNR and SiNRG can be used for the development of NH 3 chemical sensor based on chemi-resistor. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Background: The history of human populations occupying the plains and mountain ridges separating Europe from Asia has been eventful, as these natural obstacles were crossed westward by multiple waves of Turkic and Uralic-speaking migrants as well as eastward by Europeans. Unfortunately, the material records of history of this region are not dense enough to reconstruct details of population history. These considerations stimulate growing interest to obtain a genetic picture of the demographic history of migrations and admixture in Northern Eurasia. Results: We genotyped and analyzed 1076 individuals from 30 populations with geographical coverage spanning from Baltic Sea to Baikal Lake. Our dense sampling allowed us to describe in detail the population structure, provide insight into genomic history of numerous European and Asian populations, and significantly increase quantity of genetic data available for modern populations in region of North Eurasia. Our study doubles the amount of genome-wide profiles available for this region. We detected unusually high amount of shared identical-by-descent (IBD) genomic segments between several Siberian populations, such as Khanty and Ket, providing evidence of genetic relatedness across vast geographic distances and between speakers of different language families. Additionally, we observed excessive IBD sharing between Khanty and Bashkir, a group of Turkic speakers from Southern Urals region. While adding some weight to the "Finno-Ugric" origin of Bashkir, our studies highlighted that the Bashkir genepool lacks the main "core", being a multi-layered amalgamation of Turkic, Ugric, Finnish and Indo-European contributions, which points at intricacy of genetic interface between Turkic and Uralic populations. Comparison of the genetic structure of Siberian ethnicities and the geography of the region they inhabit point at existence of the "Great Siberian Vortex" directing genetic exchanges in populations across the Siberian part of Asia. Slavic speakers of Eastern Europe are, in general, very similar in their genetic composition. Ukrainians, Belarusians and Russians have almost identical proportions of Caucasus and Northern European components and have virtually no Asian influence. We capitalized on wide geographic span of our sampling to address intriguing question about the place of origin of Russian Starovers, an enigmatic Eastern Orthodox Old Believers religious group relocated to Siberia in seventeenth century. A comparative reAdmix analysis, complemented by IBD sharing, placed their roots in the region of the Northern European Plain, occupied by North Russians and Finno-Ugric Komi and Karelian people. Russians from Novosibirsk and Russian Starover exhibit ancestral proportions close to that of European Eastern Slavs, however, they also include between five to 10 % of Central Siberian ancestry, not present at this level in their European counterparts. Conclusions: Our project has patched the hole in the genetic map of Eurasia: we demonstrated complexity of genetic structure of Northern Eurasians, existence of East-West and North-South genetic gradients, and assessed different inputs of ancient populations into modern populations. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={We study a general type of multiple-input multiple-output (G-MIMO) relay channels, which consist of two groups (A and B) of source nodes and one relay node. Both groups have arbitrarily many source nodes each of which is in turn equipped with an arbitrary number of antennas. A G-MIMO relay channel engages in two-way transmission of independent information via the relay node. We obtain a tight upper bound on the total degrees of freedom (DoF) for such G-MIMO relay channels. Under the reasonable assumption that the number of antennas at the relay node is no more than the total number of antennas of either Group A or B, we design an efficient transmission scheme to achieve the upper bound by using techniques of signal alignment and joint transceiver design for interference cancellation. At the end of the paper, we propose a future research topic to quantify the relationship between graded levels of network security and the corresponding DoF of the G-MIMO relay channels. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature},

abstract={An effort has been made to develop a new composition of AlMgNiCrTi high entropy alloy (HEA) with a distinct properties includes squat density, intense strength and hardness, superior corrosion resistance, better oxidation resistance, high temperature resistance, fatigue load and crack resistance to congregate the necessity of aircraft applications. The equivalent atomic percentage for the above defined composition is established using analytical correlation for molar and atom renovation by trial and error method. The alloy is synthesized by powder metallurgy technique through mechanical alloying. Succeeding to mechanical alloying it is elucidated that the metal powder is primarily composed of single BCC solid solution with crystallite magnitude <10 nm. It is also observed that the alloy is thermally stable at prominent temperature about 800°C as it is retained its nanostructure which was revealed using differential scanning caloriemetry (DSC). This alloy powder was consolidated and sintered using spark plasma sintering at 800°C with 50 Mpa pressure to a density of 98.83%. Subsequent to sintering, Titanium carbide FCC phase evolved along with the BCC phase. The alloying behavior and phase transformation were studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The homogeneity of the composition is confirmed by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The hardness of the alloy is found to be 710±20 HV. The evolutions of the phases and hardness imply that this alloy is apposite for both high strength and high temperature applications. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2017.},

abstract={This paper presents a laboratory study on the influence of combination of crushed waste glass powder (GP) and ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) as a partial replacement in cement, on the behaviour of mechanical and durability properties of concrete. The mechanical properties were examined by the tests of compressive strength, flexural strength, bond strength and split tensile strength. Durability aspects viz., water absorption and sorptivity were examined. Replacement of cement by GP was from 5% to 45% in step of 5% and the GGBS with range of replacement from 45% to 5% in step of 5% respectively. In total, ten different combinations of mixes were studied at three different ages of concrete namely 3, 7 and 28 days of concrete. The optimum mix was selected from the 3, 7, 28-days age compressive strengths of different mixes. The combined mix (cement + GP + GGBS) as 50:15:35 and 50:20:30 increased the compressive strength by 44.20% and 43.08% respectively. Similarly the split tensile strength of the combined mix (cement + GP + GGBS) with 50:15:35 and 50:20:30 increased the split tensile strength value over the control mix by 9% and 7.6% respectively. It was found that addition of GP and GGBS reduced the sorptivity rate and water absorption rate. This study also shown that GP and GGBS can be successfully utilized as an effective mineral admixture in cement concrete with 15% and 35% respectively as a optimal replacement of cement in combined manner. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

Protection of such significant medical records against unauthorized access needs an important attention. In this work, the medical image is stored in on-chip memory of FPGA and upon authentication through an unique key received through the keyboard, the image will be displayed in a VGA monitor. In the event of detecting wrong password / key, the encryption of medical image has been carried out using Cellular Automata (CA). Authentication has been improved by hardware triggered password.

abstract={In most of the scenarios, accidents occur due to the carelessness of the driver. To reduce the accidents sharing of the vehicle's dynamics information is essential. The primary vehicle uses several sensors to collect information which were transmitted to the next subordinate vehicles that follow it. For communicating huge data between vehicles we need a Multiple Input Multiple Output Radio Frequency (MIMO-RF) transceiver which leads to increase in complexity and cost of vehicle design. This drawback can be overcome by using the existing Visible Light Communication (VLC), because of the accessibility of light source and probability of seamless communication. In this paper, a Light Emitting Array (LEA) setup is likely to be placed which is the Region of Interest (ROI). The comparative distance between the camera and the LEA varies dynamically that leads to increase in average Bit Error Rate (BER) at the output of the detector. To overcome this problem, we proposed the Kalman filter methodology along with regular geometry techniques to locate and track the LEA and the deformed shape of LEA is corrected utilizing perspective projection that maximizes the average BER performance. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme has an optimum performance than the existing method. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={We report the electronic structure and effective mass of a fascinating quasi 1D material, Phosphorene nanoribbons (PNRs). The bandstructure of different orientations of PNRs and its modulation by external electric field reveal the semiconductor to metallic transition and excite device scientists for further application. The behaviour of electrons in PNRs is traced in effective mass calculation. Also, we have used two different simulation methods (namely DFT and DFTB) to propose cost effective computation for theoretical calculations. At the end, a small Armchair Phosphorene nanoribbons (APNRs) device is simulated using Non Equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) methods to show its application in device domain. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={True random numbers have a fair role in modern digital transactions. In order to achieve secured authentication, true random numbers are generated as security keys which are highly unpredictable and non-repetitive. True random number generators are used mainly in the field of cryptography to generate random cryptographic keys for secure data transmission. The proposed work aims at the generation of true random numbers based on CMOS Boolean Chaotic Oscillator. As a part of this work, ASIC approach of CMOS Boolean Chaotic Oscillator is modelled and simulated using Cadence Virtuoso tool based on 45nm CMOS technology. Besides, prototype model has been implemented with circuit components and analysed using NI ELVIS platform. The strength of the generated random numbers was ensured by NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) Test Suite and ASIC approach was validated through various parameters by performing various analyses such as frequency, delay and power. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Sequence-specific binding of proteins to DNA is essential for almost all the cellular processes like transcription, translation, replication, etc. One among the various mechanisms that has been identified so far that contributes to the specificity in protein-DNA interaction is the DNA conformational change. Electrostatic neutralization of the phosphate groups by the positively charged amino acid residues in proteins is thought to bring about such conformational changes in DNA. Here, we employ molecular dynamics simulations to examine the effect of charge on amino acids Lys113, Arg145, and Asp91 which are attached to the scissile phosphate on the conformation of DNA in EcoRI-DNA complex. The results indicate that the charge of these amino acids is essential for maintaining the local conformation of DNA in the EcoRIbound form. Interestingly, we observe that the positively charged amino acids Lys113 and Arg145 have a long-range influence on the DNA conformation, whereas the negatively charged amino acid Asp91 has only a localized effect on the DNA conformation. The charge on the amino acids also alters the collective dynamics of EcoRI. Collectively, the results shed light on the diversity of the effect of charges on DNA conformation as well as on protein dynamics. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={The cutaneous wound-healing program is a product of a complex interplay among diverse cell types within the skin. One fundamental process that is mediated by these reciprocal interactions is the mobilization of local stem cell pools to promote tissue regeneration and repair. Using the ablation of epidermal caspase-8 as a model of wound healing in Mus musculus, we analyzed the signaling components responsible for epithelial stem cell proliferation. We found that IL-1α and IL-7 secreted from keratinocytes work in tandem to expand the activated population of resident epidermal γδT-cells. A downstream effect of activated γδT-cells is the preferential proliferation of hair follicle stem cells. By contrast, IL-1α-dependent stimulation of dermal fibroblasts optimally stimulates epidermal stem cell proliferation. These findings provide new mechanistic insights into the regulation and function of epidermal cell-immune cell interactions and into how components that are classically associated with inflammation can differentially influence distinct stem cell niches within a tissue. © Lee et al.},

abstract={Radiotherapy is used to treat tumors of different origins and nature, but often lead to development of radioresistance and metastasis of cells. Interestingly, radiation induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process by which epithelial cells undergo mesenchymal phenotype and stimulates tumor progression capability. Our study investigated the effect of Trichostatin A (TSA), a natural derivate isolated from Streptomyces, upon radiation-induced lung EMT and we tried to understand the role of signaling molecules in irradiated lung cancer cells (A549). The cells were categorized into four groups: untreated control, radiation alone (R; 8Gy, X-ray), radiation combined with TSA (R + T) and TSA (100nM). Radiation-induced lung EMT were evidenced by decreased expression of epithelial marker like E-cadherin, Zona occluden1 (ZO-1) and increased expression of N-cadherin and Vimentin. The Snail protein, a master regulator of EMT, was observed to be elevated after radiation treatment. In addition, TGF-β1 signaling (smad2, 3, and 4) proteins were activated upon irradiation. Western blot data were supported by the altered m-RNA expression of E-cadherin, TGF-β and Snail genes and this effect were reversed by TSA treatment. In addition to this, as supportive evidence, we performed docking studies between snail protein and TSA using Auto docking software and results suggested that less binding energy was needed for the putative binding of TSA on C-terminal domain of Snail protein. Based on our report, we suggest that TSA can effectively inhibit radiation-induced EMT (i) by altering epithelial and mesenchymal markers (ii) by modulating signaling molecules of TGFβ1 pathway (iii) by inhibiting cancer cell migratory potential in A549 cells (iv)by effectively binding to Snail which is an enhancer of EMT. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The flexural behavior of Fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) sheets has gained much research interest in the flexural strengthening of reinforced concrete beams. The study on flexure includes various parameters like increase in strength of the member due to the externally bonded (EB) Fiber reinforced polymer, crack patterns, debonding of the fiber from the structure, scaling, convenience of using the fibers, cost effectiveness, etc. The present work aims to study experimentally about the reasons behind the failure due to flexure of an externally bonded FRP concrete beam. In the design of FRP-reinforced concrete structures, deflection control is as critical as much as flexural strength. A numerical model is created using Finite element (FEM) software and the results are compared with that of the experiment. © 2017 Techno-Press, Ltd.},

abstract={In this technological era, it is highly essential to protect the digital medical data from the fraud and forgery as they are transmitted over the public channel. Also with the increased data traffic, it is hard to transmit the entire bulky medical data. New methods have come into the scene to reduce the traffic while maintaining the sufficient level of security. Partial encryption is one of the methods which selectively encrypt the bulky medical image. Meanwhile, if the same medical image is needed to be reused for another diagnosis, then it is recommended to protect the entire medical image. This paper proposes a hybrid encryption scheme based on deoxyribo nucleic acid and chaotic maps, which can be adaptable for both selective and full medical image encryption. The proposed algorithm uses multiple chaotic maps in single process to generate the highly random keys for encrypting the color digital imaging and communications in medicine image. The algorithm comprises three phases, namely, permutation, encoding, and diffusion. In all the phases, the selection of specific rule set depends on the key sequences produced from the combined chaotic system. Experimental results are carried out to validate the resistance of the developed algorithm toward statistical, differential, and brute force attacks. © 2002-2011 IEEE.},

abstract={A new control technique is proposed in this work for efficient operation of DFIG (Doubly Fed Induction Generator) operating in unbalanced condition of grid voltage using Model Predictive Direct Power Control (MPDPC) along with a power compensator. In MPDPC method, a controlled system model predicts the imminent behavior of the system over a long range to regulate the direct reactive and active powers in the stator instantaneously. Also, MPDPC selects the appropriate rotor voltage vector which has least ripples using an optimization cost function. Then, power compensation scheme generates power references to MPDPC without the amputation of negative sequence components of the stator current. The proposed method reduces the distortions in the stator currents and eliminates the electromagnetic torque oscillations. The effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm is realized in Matlab/Simulink and the dynamic response of the controller in improving the power quality is studied. © 2006-2017 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).},

abstract={In recent decades, overhead insulators play a major role in electrical distribution system for transmitting power through transmission line over long distances owing to its high insulation strength. Nonetheless under contaminated conditions, insulation strength decreases due to rise in pollution levels of environment. Hence, it is required to check the ability of the insulator by artificial test approaches in polluted situations. This paper deals with the performance on high voltage 11 kV rated overhead insulators of polymer and porcelain type under contaminated conditions based on IEC 60805. Insulators are contaminated with suitable proportions of NaCl and applied uniformly on the surface. In this study, tests are carried out on insulators under power frequency to check for the withstand voltage test, lightning and switching impulse withstand voltage tests with negative impulses. It is clear from the experiments done on the insulators that flashover occurs at lesser voltages when the pollution level is high which in turn increases conductivity. The relation between leakage current and applied voltage, under different fixed levels of pollution is observed. © 2006-2017 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).},

abstract={Waste sardine oil, a byproduct of fish industry, was employed as a low cost feedstock for biodiesel production. It has relatively high free fatty acid (FFA) content (32 mg KOH/g of oil). Lipase enzyme immobilized on activated carbon was used as the catalyst for the transesterification reaction. Process variables viz. reaction temperature, water content and oil to methanol molar ratio were optimized. Optimum methanol to oil molar ratio, water content and temperature were found to be 9:1, 10 v/v% and 30 °C respectively. Reusability of immobilized lipase was studied and it was found after 5 cycles of reuse there was about 13% drop in FAME yield. Engine performance of the produced biodiesel was studied in a Variable Compression Engine and the results confirm that waste sardine oil is a potential alternate and low-cost feedstock for biodiesel production. © 2017 The Authors},

Analytical expressions for the concentration of substrate and product are established for all values of reaction–diffusion parameters using second kind Chebyshev wavelet method. The analytical results were also compared with Homotopy perturbation method (HPM) and Adomian decomposition method (ADM). Satisfactory agreement with ADM and HPM solutions is observed.

abstract={Purpose: Sodium thiosulfate (STS) has of late been proven efficacious in models of urolithiasis and vascular calcification. However, its cardiovascular effects on ischemia reperfusion injury (IR) have not been revealed. Being an antioxidant and calcium chelator, it is assumed to play a vital role in IR as ROS production and calcium overload are major perpetrators of IR injury. Methods: The cardioprotective effect of STS was evaluated in vitro using H9C2 cardiomyocytes and in vivo using both isolated rat heart and intact left anterior descending artery (LAD) occlusion models of ischemia reperfusion injury. Finally, in silico tools were utilized to establish its possible mode of action. Myocardial injury markers and expression of apoptotic proteins were studied along with myocardial histopathology. Results: STS of 1 mM recovered H9C2 cells from glucose oxidase/catalase-induced apoptosis. The isolated rat heart treated with STS prior to IR injury improved its hemodynamics and reduced the infarct size to 9%. This was supported by the absence of derangement of cardiac fibers from H&E stained section of LAD-occluded rats. Plasma troponin levels decreased by 15% compared to IR and the myocardium showed diminished apoptotic proteins. An in silico docking analysis revealed higher binding affinity of STS for caspase-3 with a binding energy of − 60.523 kcal/mol for the complex. Conclusion: The effectiveness of STS as a cardioprotective agent is attributed to the reduction of apoptosis by binding to the active site of caspase-3 in silico, which was substantiated by the reduced expression of caspase-3 and poly ADP ribose polymerase levels. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Multiphase flows play a vital role in many industrial and naturally occurring processes. Recent trend of miniaturization in mini/micro fluid reactors, compact heat exchangers and micro thrusters requires a thorough knowledge on multiphase flow phenomena in mini/micro channels. The present work is focused on the effect irradiation behavior of infrared rays (IR) during gas liquid two phase flow consisting of thin liquid films inside a mini channel. The influence of size and shape of the slug regime and liquid film thickness on IR rays is analyzed with COMSOL Multi physics package. Experiments are carried out in a 2.5 mm diameter borosilicate glass tube with wall thickness of 0.3 mm. The refraction and transmittance behavior of IR rays on slug and bubbly flow is studied by analyzing the Current-time output of an IR photodiode kept at different angles with the test section. The results are found to be in good agreement with experimental image processing technique and COMSOL results. The results obtained will be useful for designing of IR sensor arrays sensitive to multiphase flows. It can also be used for measurement of liquid film thickness with proper calibration. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Digital transferring of medical images in a fraction of second has become inevitable in this internet era. Hence, it is very much essential and need of the time to protect any personal information with utmost secrecy against unauthorized viewers by victimization cryptography. To facilitate the process of getting secure communication, the recent advances in wireless technology have reached its peak and paved way to use the licensed frequency bands suited for Cognitive Radio (CR). In this paper, initially sensing the frequency bands that are not in demand will be initially identified by the CR users, and then the essential encrypted biomedical information will be exchanged between data management systems in hospitals, doctors and patients in rural areas using the identified free spectrum holes. The sensitivity of the encryption algorithm was tested by passing the encrypted medical information over wireless channels like Additive White Gaussian Noise, Rayleigh and Rican channels. Bit error rate, number of pixel changing rate and unified average changing intensity, entropy, correlation values and Chi square tests were estimated to ascertain the reliability and effectiveness of the proposed scheme offering good resistance to known plain text, color noise and chosen cipher text attacks. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Esophagus is a complex, hollow organ consisting of epithelial cells in the inner mucosal layer and smooth muscle cells in the outer muscle layer. In the present study, we have evaluated the in vitro co-culture of epithelial cells and smooth muscle cells on the aligned nanofibrous scaffold made of PHBV, PHBV-gelatin, PCL and PCL-gelatin developed through electrospinning using rotating drum collector. Epithelial cells were labeled with cell tracker green while the smooth muscle cells were labeled with cell tracker red. Labeled cells were seeded on the aligned nanofibers matrices and tracked using laser scanning confocal microscopy. The results demonstrate that both epithelial and smooth muscle cells attach, extend, and proliferate over these nanofibrous matrices. Confocal z-sectioning shows that epithelial and smooth muscle cells tend to separate into two distinct layers on a single nanofiber system mimicking the in vivo anatomy. Cell viability assay showed that both types of cells are viable and also interact with each other. The functional gene expression of respective cell types demonstrates that both epithelial and smooth muscle cells are phenotypically as well as functionally active when they were co-cultured. Thus the study highlighted that aligned nanofibrous scaffolds could be potential alternative graft for esophageal tissue regeneration. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The fresh fruit of Capsicum annuum L. (red bell pepper) was successively extracted using n-hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, ethanol and their percentage yield was calculated. The effectiveness of each extract on chemical composition and antioxidant activity was studied. The qualitative phytochemical evaluation of each extract of bell pepper was done by HPTLC and Gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) analysis. The total content of phenols, flavonoids and carotenoids were estimated by standard chemical methods. Further, the antioxidant potential of each extract was measured via DPPH and reducing power assays. Gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy analysis showed that the majority of compounds were related to phenols and flavonoids. Further analysis of the extract by HPTLC verified the presence of different types of phenolic compounds in addition to flavonoids and carotenoids. Among the different solvent extracts analyzed, total phenolic content was higher in ethanol extract (7.136 ± 0.03%, w/w) whereas ethyl acetate extract showed the presence of higher flavonoid content (4.0521 ± 0.03%, w/w). The ethanol and ethyl acetate extracts of the fruit of C. annuum exhibited the highest radical scavenging activity with inhibition percentage of 53.66 and 49.55% at a concentration of 254 µg/ml. Based on the biochemical analysis and phytochemical screening, we conclude that C. annuum possess potent antioxidant potential and this ability of the extract is attributed to the presence of rich polyphenolic compounds. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Rapid debris flows, a mixture of unconsolidated sediments and water travelling at speeds > 10 m/s are the most destructive water related mass movements that affect hill and mountain regions. The predisposing factors setting the stage for the event are the availability of materials, type of materials, stream power, slope gradient, aspect and curvature, lithology, land use and land cover, lineament density, and drainage. Rainfall is the most common triggering factor that causes debris flow in the Palar subwatershed and seismicity is not considered as it is a stable continental region and moderate seismic zone. Also, there are no records of major seismic activities in the past. In this study, one of the less explored heuristic methods known as the analytical network process (ANP) is used to map the spatial propensity of debris flow. This method is based on top-down decision model and is a multi-criteria, decision-making tool that translates subjective assessment of relative importance to weights or scores and is implemented in the Palar subwatershed which is part of the Western Ghats in southern India. The results suggest that the factors influencing debris flow susceptibility in this region are the availability of material on the slope, peak flow, gradient of the slope, land use and land cover, and proximity to streams. Among all, peak discharge is identified as the chief factor causing debris flow. The use of micro-scale watersheds demonstrated in this study to develop the susceptibility map can be very effective for local level planning and land management. © Indian Academy of Sciences.},

abstract={Present study involves the experimental analysis of spherically voided biaxial slabs. The intention was to eliminate the unused concrete in massive slab constructions. Three voided slab specimens (2900 mm × 2900 mm × 100 mm) were cast. The voids were created by introducing spherical-shaped high-density poly propylene void formers in between the compression and tension layers of the slab. The parameter varied was the spacing of the void formers, which were kept as 20, 30 and 50 mm. The corresponding reduction in volume of concrete for the above-mentioned spacing was 22.7, 18.4 and 12.21%, respectively. The slabs were subjected to area loading instead of regular five-point loading. Analytical calculation for the ultimate load carrying capacity was carried out similar to biaxial solid slab. Comparison of load deflection behaviour showed that void spacing between 20 and 30 mm may be provided to satisfy both strength and serviceability criteria. The percentage reduction in volume of concrete was found to be directly proportional to percentage reduction in cost of construction. © 2017, Shiraz University.},

Philadelphia 2008). Two-player game strategy is adopted by using two separate cost functions, viz., H2 and H∞ cost functions for the minimizing and maximizing players of the game, respectively. The problem ultimately reduces to solving a pair of cross-coupled Riccati equations. Although solving the coupled Riccati equations resulting from LQ games is by itself of theoretical importance, in the present work it has been extended, for the first of its kind, to the regime of receding horizon control. Numerical examples are provided for disturbance rejection case to check the efficiency of the present algorithm against another established robust MPC (Orukpe et al. in Proceedings of American control conference.

Many studies have been published concerning the routing and wavelength assignment problem formulated as NP-complete Integer Linear Programming problem. The work in this paper focuses static connection requests and wavelength conversion aspects of the RWA problem. Many works by the researchers show that even for small networks the ILP formulations have polynomial time complexity. The proposal aims to provide optimal utilization of wavelengths and wavelength conversion resources, thereby resulting in minimization of number of wavelengths and cost involved in wavelength conversion. In this research work, single objective and multi objective Genetic Algorithm approaches for light path establishment are presented.

abstract={Various field and laboratory experiments show that prey refuge plays a significant role in the stability of prey–predator dynamics. On the other hand, theoretical studies show that delayed system exhibits a much more realistic dynamics than its non-delayed counterpart. In this paper, we study a multi-delayed prey–predator model with prey refuge. We consider modified Holling Type II response function that incorporates the effect of prey refuge and then introduce two discrete delays in the model system. A negative feedback delay is considered in the logistic prey growth rate to represent density dependent feedback mechanism and a positive feedback delay is considered to represent the gestation time of the predator. Our study reveals that the system exhibits different dynamical behaviors, viz., stable coexistence, periodic coexistence or chaos depending on the values of the delay parameters and degree of prey refuge. The interplay between two delays for a fixed value of prey refuge has also been determined. It is noticed that these delays work in a complementary fashion. In addition, using the normal form theory and center manifold argument, we derive the explicit formulae for determining the direction of the bifurcation, the stability and other properties of the bifurcating periodic solutions. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Cryptococcus neoformans infection is quite complex with both host-pathogen interaction and host immune profile determining disease progress and therapeutic outcome. Hence in the present study, the potential utility of (E)-5-benzylidenedihydrofuran-2(3 H)-one (compound-6) was explored as an effective anticryptococcal compound with immunomodulatory potential. The efficacy of compound-6 in pulmonary cryptococosis model using H99 strain was investigated. The effective dose was found to provide 100% survival, with a significant reduction of yeast burden in lungs and brain. The biodistribution analysis provided evidence for the presence of higher concentration of compound-6 in major organs including lungs and brain. In addition, compound-6 treated mice had significantly higher expression of IL-6, IL-4 and IFN-γ in lung and brain. Similarly, elevated expression of TNF-α, IL-β1 and IL-12 were observed in lungs, suggesting the protective host response against C. neoformans. The reduction and clearance of fungal load in systemic organs and mouse survival are notable results to confirm the ability of compound-6 to treat cryptococcosis. In conclusion, the low molecular weight (174 Da), lipophilicity, its ability to cross blood brain barrier, and facilitating modulation of cytokine expression are the added advantages of compound-6 to combat against disseminated cryptococosis. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={Chloroquine (CQ) is highly effective against P. vivax, due to the rapid spread of CQ resistance in P. falciparum parasites; it is no longer the drug of choice against P. falciparum. This study elucidates the scenario of chloroquine efficacy at times that coincided with a new drug policy and especially assessed the chloroquine resistant molecular markers after withdrawal of chloroquine in Kolkata and Purulia, two malaria endemic zones of West Bengal, India. In vitro CQ susceptibility was tested in 781 patients with P. falciparum mono infections between 2008 and 2013, of which 338 patients had received CQ in 2008–2009. Genotyping of the pfcrt and the pfmdr1 gene was carried out in all isolates. Early treatment failure was detected in 114 patients {43 (31·39%) from Kolkata and 71 (35·32%) from Purulia} while recrudescence was identified in 13 (9.49%) and 17 (8.46%) patients from Kolkata and Purulia respectively. In vivo chloroquine resistance was strongly associated with CVMNT-YYSNY (p &lt; 0.01) and SVMNT-YYSNY (p &lt; 0.05) allele in Kolkata. In Purulia chloroquine resistance was associated with CVMNK-YYSNY (P &lt; 0.005), SVMNT-YYSNY (P &lt; 0.01) allele. The proportion of in vitro chloroquine resistance increased in subsequent years to 87.23% and 93·10% in 2013, in Kolkata and Purulia, respectively. Isolates with SVMNT-YFSND, SVMNT-YFSNY, CVIET-YFSND and CVIET-YYSNY haplotypes increased gradually (p &lt; 0.05) from 2010 to 2013, leading to a rise in IC50 (p &lt; 0.05) of chloroquine. An increase in in vitro chloroquine resistance and candidate gene mutations even after five years of chloroquine withdrawal against P. falciparum calls for synchronized research surveillance and proper containment strategies. © 2017},

abstract={The Schiff base containing imine and phenoilc –OH groups can act as a potent inhibitor against Cu2+-mediated aggregation of γ-crystallin and it had demonstrated positive cooperative effect on the chaperone activity of αA-crystallin against such type of aggregation (Chauhan et al. [30]). In this present work, we have investigated the interactions between human αA-crystallin and two Schiff bases (SB1 and SB2), the potent inhibitors against Cu2+-induced protein aggregation. Various biophysical techniques like UV–vis, fluorescence quenching, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), synchronous fluorescence and circular dichroism (CD) were used in this study. The observed static quenching of the fluorescence intensity HAA by both the Schiff bases is due to protein-ligand complex formation and the quenching constants were of the order of 104–105 M−1. The binding constants obtained from Scatchard method were found to be in the range of 104 M−1. Thermodynamics parameters of the protein-ligand binding revealed that the interaction of HAA with SB1 is entropy driven with predominant involvement of hydrophobic interactions. In contrary, van der Waals interactions and hydrogen bonding dominate over hydrophobic interactions in the binding process of SB2 with HAA. From the FRET calculation, the average binding distance between the donor (Trp 9 of HAA) and acceptor (SB) was found 2.78 and 6.28 nm for SB1 and SB2 respectively. No major conformational change of HAA due to the interaction was observed qualitatively from the synchronous fluorescence spectra and quantitatively from the CD spectroscopy. Molecular docking studies also substantiated the experimental observations. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In view of well-documented association of hyperhomocysteinaemia with a wide spectrum of diseases and higher incidence of vitamin deficiencies in Indians, we proposed a mathematical model to forecast the role of demographic and genetic variables in influencing homocysteine metabolism and investigated the influence of life style modulations in controlling homocysteine levels. Total plasma homocysteine levels were measured in fasting samples using reverse phase HPLC. Multiple linear regression (MLR) and neuro-fuzzy models were developed. The MLR model explained 64% variability in homocysteine, while the neuro-fuzzy model showed higher accuracy in predicting homocysteine with a mean absolute error of 0.00002 μmol / L. Methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate homocysteine methyltransferase (MTR) A2756G and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate homocysteine methyltransferase reductase (MTRR) A66G were shown to be positively associatiated with homocysteine, while nonvegetarian diet, serine hydroxymethyltransferase 1 (SHMT1) C1420T and TYMS 5 ′-UTR 28 bp tandem repeat exhibited negative association with homocysteine. The protective role of SHMT1 C1420T was attributed to more H-bonding interactions in the mutant modelled compared to the wild type, as shown through in silico analysis. To conclude, polymorphisms in genes regulating remethylation of homocysteine strongly influence homocysteine levels. The restoration of one-carbon homeostasis by SHMT1 C1420T or increased flux of folate towards remethylation due to TYMS 5 ′-UTR 28 bp tandem repeat or nonvegetarian diet can lower homocysteine levels. © 2017, Indian Academy of Sciences.},

abstract={Tigers have lost 93% of their historical range worldwide. India plays a vital role in the conservation of tigers since nearly 60% of all wild tigers are currently found here. However, as protected areas are small (&lt;300 km2 on average), with only a few individuals in each, many of them may not be independently viable. It is thus important to identify and conserve genetically connected populations, as well as to maintain connectivity within them. We collected samples from wild tigers (Panthera tigris tigris) across India and used genome-wide SNPs to infer genetic connectivity. We genotyped 10,184 SNPs from 38 individuals across 17 protected areas and identified three genetically distinct clusters (corresponding to northwest, southern and central India). The northwest cluster was isolated with low variation and high relatedness. The geographically large central cluster included tigers from central, northeastern and northern India, and had the highest variation. Most genetic diversity (62%) was shared among clusters, while unique variation was highest in the central cluster (8.5%) and lowest in the northwestern one (2%). We did not detect signatures of differential selection or local adaptation. We highlight that the northwest population requires conservation attention to ensure persistence of these tigers. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={Sweep frequency response analysis (SFRA) is a diagnostic technique which can identify faults within transformers. Though SFRA approaches are used to identify faults, their effectiveness in discriminating two same level faults at two different locations within transformer is not much analysed and reported. Experiments were carried out on a 1 kVA, single phase, 240 V/240 V laboratory transformers and on a 315 kVA, three phase, 11 kV/433 V, Dyn11, ONAN, distribution transformer, to analyse the usefulness of SFRA in inter turn short identification and discriminations. Faulty conditions were created artificially in transformers, by shorting the tappings provided in one of their windings, at different levels and locations. Open circuit self-impedance and transfer voltage transfer function approaches were experimented and transfer function plots representing winding impedance and voltage transfer ratios at various frequencies were developed for transformers, under normal and faulty conditions. Significant differences were identified at some frequencies while comparing normal case plots with faulty case plots. It was observed that the SFRA is effective in identifying shorts within transformer winding as well as, discriminating two same level shorts (i.e.) locating shorts. Statistical analysis using absolute difference and min-max ratio also confirmed the efficacy of these approaches. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology.},

abstract={Aircraft engines need a cooling system to keep the engine oil well within the temperature limits for continuous operation. The aircraft selected for this study is a typical pusher type Light Transport Aircraft (LTA) having twin turbo prop engines mounted at the aft end of the fuselage. Due to the pusher propeller configuration, effective oil cooling is a critical issue, especially during low-speed ground operations like engine idling and also in taxiing and initial climb. However, the possibility of utilizing the inflow induced by the propeller for oil cooling is the subject matter of investigation in this work. The oil cooler duct was designed to accommodate the required mass flow, estimated using the oil cooler performance graph. A series of experiments were carried out with and without oil cooler duct attached to the nacelle, in order to investigate the mass flow induced by the propeller and its adequacy to cool the engine oil. Experimental results show that the oil cooler positioned at roughly 25% of the propeller radius from the nacelle center line leads to adequate cooling, without incorporating additional means. Furthermore, it is suggested to install a NACA scoop to minimize spillage drag by increasing pressure recovery. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.},

abstract={More than 80% of chronic infections of bacteria are caused by biofilms. It is also a long-term survival strategy of the pathogens in a nonhost environment. Several amphiphilic molecules have been used in the past to potentially disrupt biofilms; however, the involvement of multistep synthesis, complicated purification and poor yield still remains a major problem. Herein, we report a facile synthesis of glycolipid based surfactant from renewable feedstocks in good yield. The nature of carbohydrate unit present in glycolipid influence the ring chain tautomerism, which resulted in the existence of either cyclic structure or both cyclic and acyclic structures. Interestingly, these glycolipids self-assemble into gel in highly hydrophobic solvents and vegetable oils, and displayed foam formation in water. The potential application of these self-assembled glycolipids to disrupt preformed biofilm was examined against various pathogens. It was observed that glycolipid 6a disrupts Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria monocytogenes biofilm, while the compound 6c was effective in disassembling uropathogenic E. coli and Salmonella enterica Typhimurium biofilms. Altogether, the supramolecular self-assembled materials, either as gel or as surfactant solution could be potentially used for surface cleansing in hospital environments or the food processing industries to effectively reduce pathogenic biofilms. © 2017 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Image encryption is being adopted as a secure strategy to protect the confidential images across the information sharing arena. Scrambling process plays an important role in achieving better confusion during the image encryption. An image encryption scheme based on cyclic shift and chaotic system has been proposed by Wang X-Y et al, 2015 [1]. In that approach, the scrambling process based on logistic map sequence was not efficient to randomize the pixels during image encryption. The randomization resulted in repetitive pixel addresses before reaching the maximal length sequence i.e. total number of image pixels. The lossless reproduction of the secret image during the decryption can only be improved by choosing proper scrambling source during the encryption. This paper addresses some of the issues of that work and proposes an alternate way to perform scrambling with enhanced multiuser improved authentication mechanism. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Wireless communication users are increasing day by day which in turn leads to scarcity for spectrum. In order to overcome this problem, cognitive radio is the booming solution. Cognitive radio (CR) is an intelligent radio that can be programmed and configured dynamically. One of the important tasks of cognitive radio is to sense the free spectrum. The availability of the signal is decided by comparing it with a predefined threshold. The threshold value cannot be too high or low as it causes probability of missed detection and probability of false alarm problems. So care should be taken in calculating the threshold value. Hence this paper aims to calculate the proper threshold value for efficient decision making so that efficient spectrum utilization could be achieved. © 2017 IEEE.},

And how to ensure this safely has become a crucial issue. This brings in the need for protection of data in other words, privacy. As a user, protection against misuse of private information is essential and hence several encryption strategies have evolved. In the proposed scheme, image encryption using various strategies in order to improve the rate of security has been adopted. The methods involved are row and column shuffling, indexing, swapping, wavelet transforms and watermarking. Stego involves hiding a message in a stego medium whereas water marking is used to prove one's copyright protection. The resultant crypto image data is highly secure and it improves the imperceptibility of the encrypted image. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={In today's scenario, securing the personal medical records needs a special attention owing to the mammoth increase of electronic patient record processing. Most of the reported works on medical data security have been implemented on software platform. In this paper, DICOM medical image encryption on reconfigurable hardware is proposed. The encryption algorithm employed for DICOM images has used key dependent, repeated diffusion and substitution processes to make it more random and secure against cryptanalytic, statistical and brute-force attacks. The encryption architecture took 12,929 Logic elements (4%) and 344.91 mW of power on Cyclone II FPGA EP2C35F672C6. Besides, a technique to display the DICOM image on PC monitor using VGA interfacing has also been developed as a part of this work. The randomness of the encrypted medical image was analyzed through Correlation, Uniform distribution, Entropy, NPCR analyses and NIST Test Suite. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Image encryption plays a crucial role in modern day secure multimedia communication. Confusion and diffusion are the two important mechanisms to encrypt the images employed in most of the image encryption schemes. In this paper, a grayscale image encryption method has been proposed with the confluence of Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR), Cellular Automata (CA) and hardware generated synthetic image. CA manages scrambling as well as diffusion. LFSR generates diffused bits which are sampled with hardware created clock source on Cyclone II FPGA in order to generate synthetic image. Synthetic image obtained through this random sampling process on FPGA enhances the randomization of encrypted images which has been evaluated with parameters such as entropy, correlation, histogram, differential, encryption quality and error metric analyses. The encryption and decryption processes were implemented using LabVIEW 2013 platform. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Polymeric amines are intensively studied due to various valuable properties. This study describes the synthesis of new polymeric amines and ampholytes by the reaction of poly(acryloyl chloride) with trimethylene-based polyamines containing one secondary and several (1-3) tertiary amine groups. The polymers contain polyamine side chains and carboxylic groups when the polyamine was in deficiency. These polymers differ in structure of side groups, but they are identical in polymerization degree and polydispersity, which facilitates the study of composition-properties relationships. The structure of the obtained polymers was confirmed with 13C nuclear magnetic resonance infrared spectroscopy, and acid-base properties were studied with potentiometry titration. Placement of the amine groups in the side chains influences their acid-base properties: protonation of the amine group exerts a larger impact on the amine in the same side chain than on the amines in the neighboring side chains. The obtained polymers are prone to aggregation in aqueous solutions tending to insolubility at definite pH values in the case of polyampholytes. Silicic acid condensation in the presence of new polymers results in soluble composite nanoparticles and composite materials which consist of ordered submicrometer particles according to dynamic light scattering and electron microscopy. Polymeric amines, ampholytes, and composite nanoparticles are capable of interacting with oligonucleotides, giving rise to complexes that hold promise for gene delivery applications. © 2017 by the authors.},

The important pre requisites of channels are re configurability and low many-sided quality. This paper proposes effective consistent multiplier (CM) engineering in light of vertical even parallel regular sub expression disposal calculation for planning a reconfigurable FIR (Finite Impulse Response) channel. In channel, the product function is computed between the input and constants coefficients defined as the multiple constant multiplication (MCM). At long last this Multiplication procedure is connected on to the Common reconfigurable FIR channel as the application improvement. Due to this proposed sub expression elimination, the number of addition stage in the multiplication process and the repeated additions were reduces, and also the logic utilization of the device reduced when compared to the existing multiplication process. Power consumption also less when compared to the full multiplication process. The proposed result shows the efficiency of the novel architecture submitted.

abstract={Modified rice bran oil (RBO) and modified mustard oil (MO) were prepared by adding oleic acid and oxidized oil separately. The physical and chemical indices like dielectric constant, viscosity, peroxide value (PV), acid value (AV), free fatty acids (FFA), iodine value (IV), and saponification value (SV) of pure and modified RO and MO were determined and correlated. Dielectric constant and viscosity were found to decrease in a non-linear fashion with increase in temperature (30°C–75°C). The dependence of dielectric constant and viscosity with temperature was investigated using model empirical equations. The dielectric variation was studied using Akerlof and Oshry’s model equations, which exhibited high dependency of R2 ranges from 0.99 to 0.997. The behaviour of viscosity with temperature was studied with Wright’s equation and the correlation coefficient (R2) was found to be 0.998. Model equations were developed, which relates dielectric constant with IV, SV, and PV with the regression coefficients R2 = 0.955, 0.936, and 0.994, respectively. The developed equations can be used in processing, pipelining, and to predict the parameters at a desired temperature. On comparing the correlations between the physical and chemical properties of the oil samples, RBO and its modified forms exhibited more oxidative stability than modified MO. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={In Siddha system of medicine, herbs, metals, minerals, hydrochemicals, arsenics and animal products are predominantly used for medicine preparations. Annabethi is a common hydrochemical drug, which is popularly known as green vitriol (chemical name is ferric sulphate). Naturally Annabethi is collected in hills and also synthesized, which is green in colour with crystal form, nauseous astringent taste and has solubility in water. It is commercially prepared by mixing iron wire with sulphuric acid and evaporating the solution to crystallization. Annabethi chenthuram is commonly used in Siddha system of medicine for treating anaemia, fever and dysentery. Even though some research studies have been conducted on Ayurvedic kasisa bhasma (similar to Annabethi chenthuram in Siddha), there is no scientific work carried out on the Annabethi chenthuram. Hence, the present research work was focused on the in-house preparation and characterization of Annabethi chenthuram. Annabethi chenthuram was prepared, physico-chemical parameters were analysed and characterized using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence, scanning electron microscope and particle size analyzer. Physico-chemical parameters such as loss on drying (1.00 %), total ash (65.94 %), water soluble ash (1.864 %) and acid insoluble ash (39.02 %) were determined. Fourier-transform infrared spectra revealed an increase of iron content (peaks at 617 and 430) when compared to the raw drug. X-ray diffraction pattern confirmed the presence of α-Fe 2 O 3 and absence of β-Fe 2 O 3 in Annabethi chenthuram. X-ray fluorescence analytical data showed that the medicine contained iron (66.46 %) and iron oxide (93.58 %). These results provided scientific evidence for the conversion of iron sulphate into an edible and bioavailable form in Annabethi chenthuram.},

abstract={Education Mining is one of the essential and inevitable processes that were conducted in the vast environment of education. Initially, the methods of data mining were applied in this area with limited number of parameters, because of the poor maintenance of student records in the respective institutions. After the sudden leap of the technology in various aspects of human life, this field’s dimension has been changed. Institutions have been equipped highly efficient technical components to maintain the data. Now-a-days the amounts of data that are stored in Educational Data Base (EDB) are increasing rapidly. At any time, the following problems are faced by institutions: poor performance of the student, leaving the programme in-between due to the complexity of the curriculum, financial problems, psychological problems, lack of support from the parent side, etc,. But in this work, the concentration is focused on Post-Graduation students. Because, now-a-days the research status at PG level is low compared to other parts of the world. To increase the standard, as well as, to identify the selected individual’s state, whether he/she is to be given additional care or to sharpen his/her research abilities. According to the report of MHRD of India, among the Asian countries the contribution of India is 25%, which is low compared to other parts the world. Also, in India, the percent of students moving from Master Degree to Ph. D level is 0.3%, which is highly low. The prediction process has been concentrated on the student’s performance with various parameters and the students were categorized as high, medium, and low. For this process, we combined two techniques: (i) for classification – Support Vector Machine (SVM), and (ii) for clustering – K-means algorithm. © IAEME Publication.},

abstract={Particulate pollution by metals and metal oxides cause environmental and health hazards in different levels depending upon the spatial location and seasonal temporal variations. This paper aims to determine the level of bioaccumulation of particulate pollutants and its variation due to environmental location and seasonal impacts in a wellknown versatile tropical waste land plant and bioindicator, Ricinus communis. The bioaccumulation across 3 sites namely residential, traffic prone and industrially polluted sites were chosen over two seasons namely dry and wet. The elemental compositional analysis was carried out using X-Ray fluorescence technology and micrographic images (SEM) were used to examine and compare the bio-accumulated particulate metallic pollutants in the aerial parts of the bio-indicator plant. The bioaccumulation of Pb was high in wet season than in dry season across all sites irrespective of the location, but the level of Pb accumulation was varying between sites due to influence of seasonal effects caused by monsoon indicating more accumulation in residential site due to industrial leach and percolation. Particulate accumulation of Ca and Fe and its oxides were persistently high both in dry and wet seasons in traffic prone site than the other 2 sites. Similarly, S, Si and their oxides were persistent across 2 seasons but, their levels were influenced by temporal factor of seasonal characters such as rain and arid climatic conditions, scoring high for wet season. The bio- accumulation of alkali earth metals, Na and Cl were influenced both by spatial and temporal factors such as anthropogenic activities and monsoon effects, accumulating more in industrial site and in wet season. This paper clearly demarcates the influence of spatial and temporal factors on 19 metallic and non metallic particulate matters and their oxides. © 2006-2017 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).},

However, there are certain circuits where inductor cannot be dispensed with. One such case is the audio frequency oscillator and a better choice is to go for designing oscillators using a simulated inductor.

abstract={Objective To study the renal toxic effect of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiNPs) prepared by chemical and green route. Methods TiNPs were prepared by chemical (sol gel technique) and green route (using aqueous extract of Desmodium gangeticum root by using titanium tetraisopropoxide as precursor). Thus prepared TiNPs were characterized using UV–visible spectrophotometry, X-ray diffractometry and evaluated its renal toxic impact in different experimental models viz., Wistar rats (100 mg/kg b.wt.; oral), LLC-PK1 cells (100 mg/mL) and isolated renal mitochondria (0.25, 0.5 and 1 mg/mL). Results Compared to the chemically synthesized TiNPs, Desmodium gangeticum synthesized nanoparticles showed less nephrotoxicity, determined by elevated serum renal markers like urea (62%), creatinine (35%), aspartate aminotransferase (61%) and alanine transaminase (37%) and the result was in agreement with cellular toxicity (measured by MTT assay and lactate dehydrogenase activity). Further toxicity evaluation at the level of mitochondria showed not much significant difference in TiNPs effect between two synthetic routes. Conclusions The biochemical findings in renal tissue and epithelial cell (LLC-PK1) supported by histopathology examination and isolated mitochondrial activity showed minor toxicity with TiNPs prepared by green route (TiNP DG) than TiNP Chem. © 2017 Hainan Medical University},

abstract={Electrical shorts in transformers on load can be diagnosed by frequency response analysis (FRA) using impulse or sinusoidal sweep signal. At HV laboratory of SASTRA, a low-voltage impulse based on-line on-load FRA (OLOL FRA) was carried out on a single phase 50 Hz, 1 kVA, 240 V/240 V small laboratory transformer while delivering power to lamp load, and the effectiveness in electrical short diagnosis was analysed. For this purpose, some artificial faults were created within one of the windings of the transformer investigated, and the responses of the winding to different frequency components of the impulse voltages were observed before and after introducing these faults. Comparison of the frequency response (impedance) of the winding under normal condition with frequency response under fault condition was made, which clearly indicated that faults had altered the winding impedance for some frequency components of the impulse. This reveals that fault within the winding can be identified and located, by the OLOL FRA technique, through careful comparisons of frequency response. Statistical analysis of transfer function magnitudes with correlation coefficient, standard deviation and absolute sum of logarithmic error has also validated the same. © 2017, The Institution of Engineering and Technology.},

abstract={Powder metallurgy (P/M) alloy steel containing copper (Cu) and molybdenum (Mo) has tremendous potential in various industrial sectors. The present work investigates the effects of Cu and Mo addition on plastic deformation/densification characteristics of P/M plain carbon (Fe–0.5%C) steel. Sintered preforms of 1 and 2% addition of Mo and Cu to the plain carbon steel were subjected to cold upsetting by applying uni-axial load on the preforms. The compressive stress was gradually applied and increased on the alloy steel preforms till fine crack appears on lateral surface of the deformed preforms. Various analytical stresses useful for die design are evaluated using conventional plasticity correlations. The plain carbon steel is observed to exhibit better densification and deformation properties and higher strain hardening exponent value compared to other alloy steels. The basic ferrite–pearlite microstructure coupled with the presence of pore-free copper and Mo particulates is understood to influence the deformation and densification of Cu- and Mo-added alloy steels, respectively. The Cu- and Mo-added alloy steels require more axial compressive stress to attain same level of plastic deformation and densification of the plain carbon steel. Addition of Cu and Mo to the plain steel is observed to reduce the plastic flow and densification level during cold upsetting. © 2017, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals.},

abstract={Articular hyaline cartilage regeneration remains challenging due to its less intrinsic reparability. The study develops injectable biphasic semi-interpenetrating polymer networks (SIPN) hydrogel impregnated with chondroitin sulfate (ChS) nanoparticles for functional cartilage restoration. ChS loaded zein nanoparticles (∼150 nm) prepared by polyelectrolyte-protein complexation were interspersed into injectable SIPNs developed by blending alginate with poly(vinyl alcohol) and calcium crosslinking. The hydrogel exhibited interconnected porous microstructure (39.9 ± 5.8 μm pore diameter, 57.7 ± 5.9% porosity), 92% swellability and >350 Pa elastic modulus. Primary chondrocytes compatibility, chondrocyte-matrix interaction with cell–cell clustering and spheroidal morphology was demonstrated in ChS loaded hydrogel and long-term (42 days) proliferation was also determined. Higher fold expression of cartilage-specific genes sox9, aggrecan and collagen-II was observed in ChS loaded hydrogel while exhibiting poor expression of collagen-I. Immunoblotting of aggregan and collagen II demonstrate favorable positive influence of ChS on chondrocytes. Thus, the injectable biphasic SIPNs could be promising composition-mimetic substitute for cartilage restoration at irregular defects. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Recent development of internet and its applications has become the source for research in service recommendation. Among them, point of interest (POI) recommendation based on user behaviour has enticed a decent attention. Along with quality of recommendations, the utilization of user feedback has grown to be a key part in the POI recommendations. While implementing similarity-based methods in conventional recommender systems, it faces various issues such as trustworthiness, sparsity and cold-start. The commonness and popularity of social network facilitate people to interact with different users and generate massive data such as user relationships, ratings and interactions. Thus, integration of trust relationship of user in location based social network along with their feedback for POI recommendation is the motivation of this work. In this article, we present a POI recommendation method based on trust enhancement in social networks known as social pertinent trust walker (SPTW). Initially, the level of trust between users in social networks is calculated through matrix factorization technique. Then, SPTW with high probability location category algorithm helps to generate POIs as list of recommendations. Experiments on real-world datasets are conducted to evaluate proposed algorithm for accuracy. Results reveal the effectiveness of approach and quality of recommendations is better, when compared to existing algorithms. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Research for the generation of reliable recommendations has been the main goal focused by many researchers in recent years. Though many recommendation approaches have been developed to assist users in the selection of their interesting items in the online world, still the personalization problem exists. In this paper, we present a new recommendation approach to address the problems such as scalability, sparsity, and cold-start in a collective way. We have developed a knowledge-based domain specific ontology for the generation of personalized recommendations. We have also introduced two different ontology-based predictive models as minion representation model and prominent representation model for the effective generation of recommendations to all types of users. The prediction models are induced by data mining algorithms by correlating the user preferences and features of items for user modeling. We have proposed a new variant of KNN algorithm as Adaptive KNN for the collaborative filtering based recommender system. The proposed recommendation approach is validated with standard MovieLens dataset and obtained results are evaluated with Precision, Recall, F-Measure, and Accuracy. The experimental results had proved the better performance of our proposed AKNN algorithm over other algorithms with the highly sparse data taken for the recommendation generation. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={The progression in the field of stereoscopic imaging has resulted in impressive 3D videos. This technology is now used for commercial and entertainment purposes and sometimes even for medical applications. Currently, it is impossible to produce quality anaglyph video using a single camera under different moving and atmospheric conditions with the corresponding depth, local colour, and structural information. The proposed study challenges the previous researches by introducing single camera based method for anaglyph reconstruction and it mainly concentrates on human visual perception, where as the previous methods used dual camera, depth sensor, multi view, which demand not only long duration they also suffer from photometric distortion due to variation in angular alignment. This study also contributes clear individual image without any occlusion with another image. We use an approach based on human vision to determine the corresponding depth information. The source frames are shifted slightly in opposite directions as the distance between the pupils increases. We integrate the colour components of the shifted frames to generate contrasting colours for each one of the marginally shifted frames. The colour component images are then reconstructed as a cyclopean image. We show the results of our method by applying it to quickly varying video sequences and compare its performance to other existing methods. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Background & objectives: Proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) is characterized by the presence of epiretinal membrane (ERM), which exerts traction and detaches the retina. Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) of the retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells underlies ERM formation. Adjuvant therapies aimed at preventing recurrence of PVR after surgery mostly failed in clinical trials. This study was aimed to evaluate the anti-EMT properties of bio-active compounds epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), curcumin and lycopene as inhibitors of EMT induced by transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) in cultured ARPE-19 cells. Methods: ARPE-19 cells were treated with TGF-β1 alone or co-treated with EGCG (1-50 µM), lycopene (1-10 µM) and curcumin (1-10 µM). The mRNA and protein expression of EMT markers, alpha-smooth muscle actin, vimentin, zonula occludens-1 and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), were assessed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction/quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence/enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Activity of MMP-2 was assessed by zymography. Functional implications of EMT were assessed by proliferation assay (MTT assay) and migration assay (scratch assay). Western-blot for phosphorylated Smad-3 and total Smad-3 was done to delineate the mechanism. Results: EGCG and curcumin at 10 µM concentration reversed EMT, inhibited proliferation and migration through Smad-3 phosphorylation, when induced by TGF-β1 in ARPE-19 cells. Lycopene did not prevent EMT in ARPE-19 cells. Interpretation & conclusions: EGCG and curcumin are potent in preventing EMT induced by TGF-β1 in ARPE-19 cells and therefore, proposed as potential molecules for further pre-clinical evaluation in PVR management. © 2018, Indian Council of Medical Research.

abstract={Paddy is one of the important long stored grains. It is usually stored in granaries to ensure continuous supply throughout the year, which can be subjected to deterioration due to various environmental conditions. Electronic nose (E-Nose) is used for non-destructive rapid in-situ detection of paddy for qualitative and quantitative assessment. Further, soft computing techniques are a promising solution for data analysis to enhance prediction accuracy. In this work, paddy quality assessment has been carried out using an E-Nose. Six different metal oxide semiconductor gas sensors are used for detecting simple and assorted volatile organic compounds evolving from paddy when stored over a period of time at different conditions. A Fuzzy Set based Multiple Linear Regression (FSMLR) has been proposed and implemented for paddy quality assessment. In the first stage, four fuzzified sensor data are given as input for assessment. While in the second stage, piecewise multiple linear equations were used for quality assessment and defuzzification. Quantitative assessment was carried out for nineteen multiple linear regression models built using fuzzy set theory. The proposed model achieves better performance metrics in terms of low root mean square error for cross validation and relative prediction error (RMSECV &lt;0.028, RPE &lt;1 × 10 −4 ) for all the models. Further, adjusted regression coefficient (R 2 = 0.99) confirms the good fit and Karl-Pearson coefficient of 0.99 confirms the prediction accuracy of the proposed model. This model can be embedded with sensor nodes for online monitoring of paddy granaries. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Ethanol serves as a biomarker as well as a chemical reagent for several applications and has been predominantly used as an alternative fuel (E10 and E85). Development of sensors for the detection and monitoring of ethanol vapor at lower operating temperatures has gathered momentum in the recent past. In this work, we reported the synthesis of self-assembled ZnO nanowires using electrospun technique without using any external surfactants or capping agents and their room temperature ethanol sensing properties. An inherent template namely monomer of the polymer poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) with two different molecular weights (14 000 and 140 000 g mol-1) was used along with the precursor zinc acetate dihydrate. The ZnO-PVA nanofibers have been tranformed to ZnO nanospheres and nanowires after calcination. The ratio of zinc precursor concentration to PVA polymer led to the enhanced carrier concentration of the resultant ZnO nanowire that enhanced, in turn, the sensing response toward ethanol vapor. The developed sensing elements have been systematically characterized to correlate their structural, morphological, and electrical properties with the respective room-temperature ethanol-sensing characteristics. The role of grain features and low activation energy of ZnO nanowires in coordination with the low dipole moment of ethanol resulted in the excellent response of 78 toward 100 ppm at room temperature with ultra-sensitive response and recovery times (9 and 12 s, respectively). © 2017 American Chemical Society.},

Also, FeO monowire molecular devices are constructed to study the sensitivity of the devices towards CO and HCHO molecules using non-equilibrium Green’s function (NEGF) with density functional theory. The zero bias electronic transport properties confirm the adsorption of the CO and HCHO on the FeO monowire devices. From the V–I characteristic and the differential conductance calculations, the FeO monowire device is more sensitive to HCHO than CO molecule.

abstract={This study aims to cast light on the physico-chemical nature and energetics of interactions between the nucleobases and water/DMSO molecules which occurs through the non-conventional CH⋯O/N − H bonds using a comprehensive quantum-chemical approach. The computed interaction energies do not show any appreciable change for all the nucleobase-solvent complexes, conforming the experimental findings on the hydration enthalpies. Compared to water, DMSO form complexes with high interaction energies. The quantitative molecular electrostatic potentials display a charge transfer during the complexation. NBO analysis shows the nucleobase-DMSO complexes, have higher stabilization energy values than the nucleobase-water complexes. AIM analysis illustrates that the in the nucleobase-DMSO complexes, S[dbnd]O⋯H-N type interaction have strongest hydrogen bond strength with high EHB values. Furthermore, the Laplacian of electron density and total electron density were negative indicating the partial covalent nature of bonding in these systems, while the other bonds are classified as noncovalent interactions. EDA analysis indicates, the electrostatic interaction is more pronounced in the case of nucleobase-water complexes, while the dispersion contribution is more dominant in nucleobase-DMSO complexes. NCI-RDG analysis proves the existence of strong hydrogen bonding in nucleobase-DMSO complex, which supports the AIM results. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={This paper presents a new two-tier decision making framework with linguistic preferences for scientific decision making. The major reason for adopting linguistic preference is to ease the process of rating of alternatives by allowing decision makers (DMs) to strongly emphasize their opinion on each alternative. In the first tier, aggregation is done using a newly proposed operator called linguistic based aggregation (LBA), which aggregates linguistic terms directly without making any conversion. The main motivation for this proposal is driven by the previous studies on aggregation theory which reveals that conversion leads to loss of information and formation of virtual sets which are no longer sensible and rational for decision making process. Secondly, in the next tier, a new ranking method called IFSP (intuitionistic fuzzy set based PROMETHEE) is proposed which is an extension to PROMETHEE (preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluation) under intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) context. Unlike previous ranking methods, this ranking method follows a new formulation by considering personal choice of the DMs over each alternative. The main motivation for such formulation is derived from the notion of not just obtaining a suitable alternative but also coherently satisfying the DMs’ viewpoint during decision process. Finally, the practicality of the framework is tested by using supplier selection (SS) problem for an automobile factory. The strength and weakness of the proposed LBA-IFSP framework are verified by comparing with other methods under the realm of theoretical and numerical analysis. The results from the analysis infer that proposed LBA-IFSP framework is rationally coherent to DMs’ viewpoint, moderately consistent with other methods and highly stable and robust against rank reversal issue. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The extensive growth of industrial demand and domestic demand will make the power system more expensive. The increase of demands will also leads to the increase of the losses from generation to the distribution level. To achieve the flexible operation of the power system from generation to the distribution along with the exponential growth of load, Flexible alternating currents transmission system (FACTS) devices are used. The inclusion of FACTS devices in the power system will make the system more reliable. With the advancements in the power electronic devices the design of facts devices will also take more advantageous position to operate the power system with more reliable. There are many types of FACTS devices such as series, shunt, series-shunt and shunt-shunt among these types shunt -shunt FACTS device plays a major role to operate the power system with less power losses and improved voltage profile. Unified power flow controller (UPFC) is one of the types of shunt-shunt FACTS device. In this paper the incorporation of UPFC within the power system which improves the voltage profile and reducing the losses. The placement of FACTS devices and size of the FACTS device is through analytical and soft computing techniques which are Genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO) are used. © 2006-2017 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).},

abstract={The aim of this work is to deposit cost-effective ZnO/g-C3N4 composite thin film on glass substrates and to study its photocatalytic dye degradation efficiency against three toxic organic dyes MB, MG and RhB. A simple and inexpensive nebulizer spray technique was employed to deposit the composite thin film samples. The photocatalysis experiment carried out against these three dyes showed that the addition of g-C3N4 with ZnO remarkably enhances the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of ZnO films. The degradation efficiency of ZnO against MB, MG and RhB is 74, 82 and 61%, respectively. The efficiency increases to 95, 97 and 73% after the addition of g-C3N4. The mechanism related to this enhancement is addressed with the help of optical and morphological results.

Overexpression of YdaS and YdaT due to RacR depletion leads to cell division defects and decrease in survival. We further show that both YdaS and YdaT can act independently as toxins and that RacR serves to counteract the toxicity by tightly downregulating the expression of these toxins. © 2017 Bindal et al.},

abstract={Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a life threatening infectious disease caused by Leishmania donovani. It leads to the severe immune suppression in the host defense system. Higher cytotoxicity, rigorous side effects and lower therapeutic indexes (TI) of current antileishmanial drugs have created a necessity to develop new molecules with better antileishmanial activity and high TI value. In this study, we have synthesized 36 derivatives of eugenol and screened them for their activity against promastigote and amastigote forms of L. donovani. Among the synthesized derivatives, comp.35 showed better antileishmanial activity against extra cellular promastigotes (IC50- 20.13 ± 0.91 μM) and intracellular amastigotes (EC50-4.25 ± 0.26 μM). The TI value (82.24 ± 3.77) was found to improve by 10–13 fold compared to Amphotericin B and Miltefosine respectively. Treatment with comp.35 (5 μg/ml) enhanced the nitric oxide (NO) generation, iNOS2 mRNA expression (∼8 folds increase) and decreased the arginase-1 activity (∼4 folds) in L. donovani infected peritoneal macrophages. Comp.35 had also increased the IL-12 (∼6 folds) and decreased the IL-10 (∼3 folds) mRNA expression and release in vitro. Results of in vivo studies revealed that comp.35 treatment at 25 mg/kg body weight efficiently cleared the hepatic and splenic parasite burden with enhanced Th1 response in L. donovani infected BALB/c mice. Hence, this study clearly represents comp.35, as an immunomodulatory molecule, can induce host protective immune response against visceral leishmaniasis through enhanced NO generation and Th1 response, which are essentials against this deadly disease. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS},

Feature selection is a preprocessing step used for selecting the significant information.

The metaheuristic optimization algorithm based on the behavior of cuckoo birds is adapted to build the parallel cuckoo search optimization (PCSO) algorithm. The wrapper approach of parallel cuckoo search with Naive Bayes (PCSNB) is developed by combining the power of exploration of PCSO with the speed of Naïve Bayes (NB) classifier for finding feature subset that maximizes the accuracy. The proposed approach is tested on seven different datasets which are having balanced and imbalanced classes and contrasted with other metaheuristic algorithms. The results are showing higher prediction accuracy than other algorithms and selects the feature subset with less features. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Digital Watermarking is one of the data hiding technique, has been popular in today's world for providing copyright protection. We will generally use Frequency Domain Watermarking Techniques like DCT and DWT to increase the efficiency. In this paper, a new approach has been implemented which uses PCA for image compression and the usage of LOG filter increased the detection rate by highlighting the edges and also it will remove the noise. The DWT Watermarking has been implemented for the filtered image. The results are much better when compared with the existing one. High improvisation of detection rate can be seen in this proposed technique and the PSNR values for this proposed technique are higher than the existing technique from which we can say this technique is more robust and secure. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, an adiabatic based vernier time-to-digital converter (VTDC) is proposed. Generally, static based vernier TDC consumes more power due to two delay chain and D-flipflop. To avoid this issue an adiabatic based vernier TDC is proposed. This proposed TDC is constructed by using adiabatic inverter and D-flipflop but in classical TDC architecture consists of static based inverter and D-flipflop. A high resolution with low power is achieved in proposed TDC. Here, 2 stages, 3 stages, 4 stages traditional and proposed vernier TDC are implemented and also discussed about power consumption comparison of 2 stages, 3 stages, 4 stages conventional and proposed vernier TDC at different supply voltages. This vernier TDC is simulated in 180nm CMOS technology. Its operating frequency is 1.5KHZ. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Generally, VLSI Circuits are very complex due to the technology scaling. Post-silicon validation is a critical part of Integrated Circuits. It is the process of finding the bugs that have escaped from the pre-silicon phase. According to International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS), time-to-market is the major constraint for verification and testing. The main challenge of post-silicon validation is that it has limited observability and controllability of internal signals in the manufactured chips. On-chip buffers are used to improve the observability and controllability of these signal states during runtime. Compared to existing techniques Trace-based debug technique has been widely utilized by the industries for the past few years to overcome the challenges. The aim of this work is to provide a framework for understanding insights and research opportunities, how the problems are dealt from different perspectives in trace-based post-silicon validation and debug. It also provides the various parametric analyses and comparisons of verification and validation techniques. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper proposes a new scientific ranking framework for optimal selection of cloud vendor(CV) for the organization. For this purpose, a set of target dimensions for cloud computing from customer point of view are defined, based on expert reviews, international literature reviews and cloud provider market analysis. This study proposes intuitionistic fuzzy group decision making (IF-GDM) approach with intuitionistic fuzzy analytic hierarchy process(IF-AHP) for effective cloud vendor selection. In the previous approaches, IF-AHP was mainly used to determine the criteria weights and ranking was performed using other intuitionistic fuzzy based ranking schemes. All these schemes ignored to verify the consistency of the decision matrices which led to unrealistic preference orders. To alleviate such issue, in this paper, a new ranking framework with IF-AHP is proposed to provide both pair-wise comparison as well as consistency check for decision matrices. A case study of cloud vendor selection is demonstrated to verify the strength of the proposed framework. © 2017 IEEE.},

The modified cryptographic approach makes use of the RSA algorithm along with Diffie-Hellman to increase the security of the encrypted data stored in cloud. The input file is split into two, in order to make the access of the whole data difficult, and the split data is encrypted using RSA and Diffie-Hellman before storing them into two different cloud accounts. The split data is then retrieved, and the retrieved cipher data is decrypted to get the original data. The split mechanism does not produce big overheads, and also assures data retrievability. Thus data stored in the cloud is more secured and it prevents cloud providers from directly reaching the cloud data. © 2017 IEEE.},

To tackle this, we have come up with a prospective Remote Health Monitoring and Alert System (RHMAS). In elderly people heart attacks are associated with symptoms like, body temperature fluctuations, high BP, profuse sweating, improper cardiac rhythm etc. Our solution is to integrate robust sensors capable of sensing and monitoring these symptoms with a microcontroller to alert the next of kin and health services during emergencies. Since most devices for this purpose are wired, a wireless device wouldn't interfere with the movement of the user The proposed system consists of a Photo-Plethysmography (PPG) based pulse sensor, to detect arrhythmia, a temperature sensor to constantly monitor their body temperature and a sweat sensor to monitor the Galvanic Skin Response (GSR). A GSM module will send an alert to the next of kin if the monitored data deviates from the nominal body condition. If the monitored data reaches emergency levels, health services would also be alerted. © 2017 IEEE.},

This problem becomes more complex when fishermen who unintentionally meander into Sri Lankan area are held captive. So there is a necessity for identifying those vessels which crosses the International Maritime Boundary Line. The Indian coast Guard has to track vessels which sail beyond the boundary and also has to determine the identity of vessel. The identity of the ship is necessary to differentiate registered ships of Tamil Nadu from the unregistered ships which may be considered suspicious. This arises the need for a static sensor which can be installed along the coastal line near Analtivu situated in Northern Province Jaffna of Sri Lanka which can detect, track and identify vessels crossing the border. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper focuses on an interesting and unresolved problem in the aggregation of decision makers' preferences. Scholars have rarely addressed this issue in group decision making process. The aggregation operators that use DMs' relative importance (weights) as one of their parameters for evaluation have strictly set a constraint that, the sum of relative importance must be equal to unity. This constraint does not fit well with decision making process as the weight values for the DMs are being forcibly estimated without offering actual freedom in such estimation. To relax this strict constraint from the aggregation process, in this paper, we make efforts to propose a new aggregation operator which considers no such constraint on DMs' weight values. This operator is an extension to simple intuitionistic fuzzy weighted geometry (SIFWG) operator. The reason for choosing SIFWG for extension is evident from the strength and simplicity of SIFWG operator. Finally, an illustrative example is demonstrated to realize the strength of the proposed aggregation operator. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Self compacting concrete (SCC) has an ideal fluid character at the fresh state and becomes solid once it sets/hardens completely when poured on the desired shape of the mould. The increase of workability and the control of segregation were taken care by super plasticizer (SP) and viscosity modifying agent (VMA) dosages. In this paper an attempt was made to study the flexural behaviour of ternary SCC beams. Cement was replaced with two different combinations viz metakaolin (mk) + ground granulated blast furnace slag (ggbs) and silica fume + ggbs. The experimental results of these ternary beams were compared with Conventional Vibrated Concrete (CVC) & SCC control concrete (SCC 0). Fresh properties of SCC like slump flow, spread were studied in accordance with EFNARC guidelines. Flexural strength of concrete was tested at the age of 28 days. Load-deflection characteristics were studied at mid span of the beam (L/2). From the results it was observed that SCC ternary blended beams have higher flexural strength and better ductile performance compared to CVC and SCC0 beams. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

The most suitable adsorption sites of alcohol vapor molecules on stanane nanosheet are investigated in atomistic level. The adsorption behavior of alcohol molecules on stanane nanosheet is studied in terms of adsorption energy, density of states spectrum, Mulliken charge transfer and average energy gap variation. The energy band structure and DOS spectrum clearly reveals the adsorption of alcohol vapors on stanane nanostructure. The changes in the energy band gap and density of charge is observed upon adsorption of methanol, ethanol and 1-propanol on p-type stanane base material. The adsorption of 1-propanol molecule on stanane nanosheet is observed to be more rather than ethanol and methanol molecules. The findings on the adsorption properties of alcohol on monolayer stanane nanosheet give the insight on stanane based chemical nanosensor. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Realization of the importance for advanced tool and techniques to secure the network infrastructure from the security risks has led to the development of many machine learning based intrusion detection techniques. However, the benefits and limitations of these techniques make the development of an efficient Intrusion Detection System (IDS), an open challenge. This paper presents an adaptive, and a robust intrusion detection technique using Hypergraph based Genetic Algorithm (HG - GA) for parameter setting and feature selection in Support Vector Machine (SVM). Hyper – clique property of Hypergraph was exploited for the generation of initial population to fasten the search for the optimal solution and to prevent the trap at the local minima. HG-GA uses a weighted objective function to maintain the trade-off between maximizing the detection rate and minimizing the false alarm rate, along with the optimal number of features. The performance of HG-GA SVM was evaluated using NSL-KDD intrusion dataset under two scenarios (i) All features and (ii) informative features obtained from HG – GA. Experimental results show the prominence of HG-GA SVM over the existing techniques in terms of classifier accuracy, detection rate, false alarm rate, and runtime analysis. © 2017},

abstract={Vibrio cholerae is a Gram-negative pathogen which causes acute diarrhoeal disease, cholera by the expression of virulence genes through quorum sensing (QS) mechanism. The QS circuit of V. cholerae is controlled by the global quorum regulator, LuxO, which at low cell density (LCD) state produces major virulence factors such as, toxin co-regulated pilus (TCP) and cholera toxin (CT) to mediate infection. On the contrary, at the high cell density (HCD) state the virulent genes are downregulated and the vibrios are detached from the host intestinal epithelial cells, promoted by HapA protease. Hence, targeting the global regulator LuxO would be a promising approach to modulate the QS to curtail V. cholerae pathogenesis. In our earlier studies, LuxO targeted ligand, 2,3 pyrazine dicarboxylic acid (PDCA) and its derivatives having desired pharmacophore properties were chemically synthesized and were shown to have biofilm inhibition as well as synergistic activity with the conventionally used antibiotics. In the present study, the QS modulatory effect of the PDCA derivative with pyrrolidine moiety designated as PDCApy against the V. cholerae virulence gene expression was analyzed at various growth phases. The data significantly showed a several fold reduction in the expression of the genes, tcp and ct whereas the expression of hapR was upregulated at the LCD state. In addition, PDCApy reduced the adhesion and invasion of the vibrios onto the INT407 intestinal cell lines. Collectively, our data suggest that PDCApy could be a potential QS modulator (QSM) for the antivirulence therapeutic approach. © 2017 Hema, Vasudevan, Balamurugan and Adline Princy.},

abstract={Objective: This study deals with the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of selected Siddha polyherbal formulations such as Amukkara choornam, Thirikadugu choornam, Eladi choornam and Thiripala choornam. Amukkara choornam consist of seven herbals (withania, ginger, black pepper, long pepper, mesua, cardamom and clove). Thirikadugu choornam has three herbal ingredients ginger, black pepper and long pepper. Eladi choornam has seven raw drugs like cardamom, ginger, arrow root, yew leaves, Mesua, black pepper and clove. Thiripala choornam comprises of three dry fruits amla, chebulla and bellerica. Methods: Even though all these medicines have been used as analgesic for joint pain in Siddha system of medicine, their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities were not yet proved scientifically. In the present work, we have evaluated the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of aqueous extract of the above-mentioned herbal formulations. Results: Among the investigated formulations, Thiripala choornam has six folds higher level of total phenolic content (1248 mf GAE/100 g) when compared to other formulations (190.42 – 199.78 mg GAE/100 g). Similarly, Thiripala choornam exhibited promising antioxidant activity in terms of radical scavenging potential against DPPH (IC-50: 156 mg/L), superoxide (IC-50: 2303 mg/L), hydrogen peroxide (IC-50: 294 mg/L) and hydroxyl radical (IC-50: 587 mg/L) and anti-inflammatory activity (IC-50: 24 mg/L). Conclusion: Among the investigated samples, Thiripala choornam was found to exhibit high antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potential and thus could be used as more effective analgesic formulation. © 2018, Association of Pharmaceutical Teachers of India.

The Bus Track system provides solution for tracking the buses on smart phones, fetches current occupancy and prediction of occupancy at upcoming stops to make wiser decisions, regulated flow of buses to maintain frequency of the buses on the route. Real time bus location tracker and occupancy details is provided by an IoT device that gives location data using GPS and updates the occupancy details through internet using mobile network. The bus conductor’s handheld ticketing machine sends data about the number of people who are traveling in the bus based on their boarding point and destination. Bus arrival and crowd prediction is done by fetching location and occupancy data from the IoT device to the user interface. Prediction of seat occupancy at upcoming stops to make commuter take wiser decisions is also done additionally. Alternate bus connections are suggested based on bus location and occupancy. A website or an application interface is implemented to map the buses plying in differ-ent routes. It displays bus details, current occupancy, and predicted occupancy for upcoming stops, estimated time of arrival and duration of journey. Alternate bus connections to the destination with their journey duration and occupancy details are given through rerouting. The resultant of the project would a system comprising of IoT device and cloud to perform predictions and fetch data to smart phones which would help the time bound working class of the city to plan efficiently without compromising on their choices and opt for public transport, which in turn would reduce pollution levels and traffic on roads. © IAEME Publication.},

abstract={Cloud is an emerging model which provides on demand services to the users with virtualization technique. Computing resources are delivered as virtual machines. In such a scenario, a task allocation method plays vital role which allocates the tasks to the proper virtual machines efficiently. To provide the machines properly and reducing the response time of the tasks, numerous task scheduling algorithm are used. Still, task scheduling is a NP-Complete problem. In this paper new algorithm is proposed to schedule the set of tasks with their deadline. In the existing protocol initially all virtual machines are used without considering the deadline. In this proposed work our aim is to minimize the usage of virtual machines and to efficiently complete the tasks within deadline. © IAEME Publication.},

abstract={The study of vibration in carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is currently a major topic of interest that increases understanding of their dynamic mechanical behavior. By now, there are three methods to analyze the mechanical properties of carbon nanotube (CNT). They are spectroscopy experiment, computational simulation, and theoretical analysis. However, technically these are difficult experiments of vibrational properties because of the small diameter of the nanotubes, and plenty of time will be spent on the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Theoretical analyses have shown the advancement of the taken cost and the spent time of researches compared with the experimental operation and molecular dynamic (MD) simulation method, and they can predict some results which cannot be achieved by the other two methods by now. Elastic continuum models are used to study the vibrational behavior of carbon nanotubes to avoid the difficulties encountered during experimental characterization of nanotubes as well as the time-consuming nature of computational atomistic simulations.

abstract={Oxidative stress and gut microbial enzymes are intricately linked to the onset of colon carcinogenesis. Phytochemicals that modulate these two factors hold promise for the development of such agents as anticancer drugs. The present study evaluates the chemopreventive potential of p-coumaric acid (p-CA) – a phenolic acid in rats challenged with the colon specific procarcinogen DMH (1,2 di-methyl hydrazine). Rats were randomized into six groups (n = 7/group). Group 1 (control); Group 2 (p-CA 200 mg/kg b.w.); Group 3 (DMH 40 mg/kg b.w.); Groups 4 (DMH + p-CA 50 mg/kg b.w.) and Group 5 (DMH + p-CA 100 mg/kg b.w.) and Group 6 (DMH + p-CA 200 mg/kg b.w.). After the experimental duration of 15 weeks’ rats were subjected to necropsy and tissues were collected for the histological and biochemical investigations. DMH induced colonic preneoplastic lesions viz., aberrant crypt foci (ACF), dysplastic ACF (DACF), mucin depleted foci (MDF) and beta catenin accumulated crypts (BCAC) were significantly suppressed by p-CA supplementation. Glucuronide conjugation of DMH in liver and its subsequent deconjugation mediated by microbes in the colon induced the formation of colonic preneoplastic lesions. p-CA inhibited these lesions and protected the rat colon against genotoxic insult by scavenging the free radicals via its strong antioxidant response and detoxification mechanism as measured by TBARS and enzymic antioxidants in control and experimental rats. Of the three tested doses, p-CA at a dose of 100 mg/kg body weight is found to exhibit a significant optimum effect compared to the other two doses 50 mg/kg body weight and 200 mg/kg body weight. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS},

abstract={Pullulan, one of the commercially important microbial exopolysaccharides, is produced by the yeast like fungus Aureobasidium pullulans. It is non-mutagenic, non-toxic, non-hygroscopic, tasteless, odorless, water soluble and edible polymer. Owing to its excellent film forming properties, and typical rheological properties, it is extensively used in diverse industrial applications that include food, agriculture, textiles, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. In the recent past, there has been growing interest to produce pullulan from low cost substrates in order to bring down cost of pullulan. The cost, productivity and properties of pullulan are highly influenced by the selection of raw material (upstream processing), type of fermentation & fermentation conditions (bioprocessing) and product recovery steps (downstream processing). In addition, both upstream and bioprocessing also affect the rheological, thermal and physical properties of the product. The present review discusses the literature on upstream processing, bioprocessing, product recovery and applications of pullulan. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In this work, a linear sweep voltammetry method has been proposed for the estimation of captan, carbosulfan, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin and pentachlorophenol using ceria nanospheres modified platinum electrode. The reduction peaks of captan and carbosulfan observed in the linear sweep voltammograms overlapped strongly and it was difficult to estimate captan and carbosulfan individually from their mixtures. Gaussian curve fitting algorithm was used to facilitate the resolution of complex linear sweep voltammograms. Quantitative analysis for each of the pesticides in a mixture was studied with the help of linear regression analysis. The analytical performance of the calibrated models was investigated with the aid of relative prediction error (RPE), root mean square error for cross validation (RMSECV) and recovery. The proposed calibrated models were then applied for the estimation of the four pesticides in several ground water samples, where the RPE, recovery and RMSECV of the spiked samples were within the acceptable limit. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Selection of trustworthy cloud services has been a major research challenge in cloud computing, due to the proliferation of numerous cloud service providers (CSPs) along every dimension of computing. This scenario makes it hard for the cloud users to identify an appropriate CSP based on their unique quality of service (QoS) requirements. A generic solution to the problem of cloud service selection can be formulated in terms of trust assessment. However, the accuracy of the trust value depends on the optimality of the service-specific trust measure parameters (TMPs) subset. This paper presents TrustCom—a novel trust assessment framework and rough set-based hypergraph technique (RSHT) for the identification of the optimal TMP subset. Experiments using Cloud Armor and synthetic trust feedback datasets show the prominence of RSHT over the existing feature selection techniques. The performance of RSHT was analyzed using Weka tool and hypergraph-based computational model with respect to the reduct size, time complexity and service ranking. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Sodium thiosulfate (STS), a cyanide antidote has been reported to possess antioxidant and calcium chelation effects, useful for the treatment of renal failure due to vascular calcification and urolithiasis. The present study investigated the in vivo modulatory effects of STS on erythrocyte calcium, phosphorous levels, lipid peroxidation, antioxidant enzyme and membrane ATPase activities (Ca2+, Na+K+, Mg2+ and 5′′ nucleotidase) in an adenine induced model of vascular calcification in rats. Adenine (0.75%) was supplemented through the diet for 28 days, which resulted in significantly (P &lt; 0.05) increased circulating calcium and phosphorous product and oxidative stress within the RBCs, as measured from lipid peroxidation and reduced antioxidant enzymes. The membrane ATPase activities were altered (increased Ca2+, Na+K+ ATPase and decreased Mg+ ATPase, 5′ nucleotidase) compared to the rats fed on normal diet. STS (400 mg/kg) given orally was effective in establishing a normalcy in the RBC alterations. This effect was more pronounced, when STS was given from day 28 to day 49 after induction of calcification, instead of day 0 to day 28. These findings may benefit to evaluate the effectiveness of STS therapy in patients with chronic renal failure associated with increased circulating calcium and phosphorous product that leads to stiffening of vascular smooth muscles of aorta, due to calcium deposition. © 2016, Association of Clinical Biochemists of India.},

abstract={Optimization is an important step in the design and development of a planar parallel manipulator. For optimization processes, workspace analysis is a crucial and preliminary objective. Generally, the workspace analysis for such manipulators is carried out using a non-dimensional approach. For planar parallel manipulators of two degrees of freedom (2-DOF), a non-dimensional workspace analysis is very advantageous. However, it becomes very difficult in the case of 3-DOF and higher DOF manipulators because of the complex shape of the workspace. In this study, the workspace shape is classified as a function of the geometric parameters, and the closed-form area expressions are derived for a constant orientation workspace of a three revolute-revolute-revolute (3-RRR) planar manipulator. The approach is also shown to be feasible for different orientations of a mobile platform. An optimization procedure for the design of planar 3-RRR manipulators is proposed for a prescribed workspace area. It is observed that the closed-form area expression for all the possible shapes of the workspace provides a larger solution space, which is further optimized considering singularity, mass of the manipulator, and a force transmission index. © 2016 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract={Purpose: The aim of this study is to elucidate the causes and level of visual impairment (VI) in patients with different pathologies of diabetic retinopathy (DR) who presented to a low vision care (LVC) clinic, to analyze the type of distant and near devices prescribed to them and the visual benefits thereof. Methods: A retrospective chart review was done for 100 consecutive patients with DR who were referred to the LVC clinic from June 2015 to June 2016. The reason for referral was assessed from the electronic medical records and available fundus photographs, fundus fluorescein angiograms, and optical coherence tomography images by a retina specialist. The details of low-vision devices and subsequent improvements were noted. Results: Of the 100 patients, 52% had moderate VI, 19% mild VI, 16% severe VI, and 13% had profound VI or blindness. The most commonly prescribed low vision device was half-eye spectacles (38.4%). The pathologies which had statistically significant improvement (P < 0.05) in distance vision with low vision devices were DR with disc pallor (4.4% improvement), ischemic maculopathy (11.9% improvement), and plaque of hard exudate (10.1% improvement). However, in all pathologies, there was statistically significant improvement (P < 0.05) in near vision. Conclusion: Usually, the patients with DR presented to the LVC clinic with moderate VI. The use of low vision devices can help these patients in cases where medical and surgical treatment have no or a limited role in restoring useful vision. © 2017 Indian Journal of Ophthalmology Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.},

abstract={Hyperpigmentation is a dermal condition of melanocyte proliferation, induced by various factors like ultraviolet radiation producing reactive oxygen species, DNA damage, and apoptosis. The application of topical antioxidants through the different type of formulations can help to prevent oxidative damage to the skin. L-ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is a water-soluble compound and the most abundant antioxidant in human skin, but this vitamin is unstable and loses its potency with poor formulation strategies. Nanotechnology has been effectively used to promote stability and therapeutic activity of various drug molecules. With this context, the objective of the work was set to formulate a topical delivery system of vitamin C nanoparticles incorporated into the polymeric gel. Vitamin C (50 mg) was loaded into ethyl cellulose nanoparticles, of varying concentrations (50–250 mg), by the solvent evaporation method and subsequently incorporated into hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose gels (3, 5, and 7%). The formulations were characterized for various physico-chemical properties such as particle size, drug content, entrapment efficiency, and drug-polymer interactions. In vitro, drug release studies were conducted by using dialysis bag method and Franz diffusion cell for the nanoparticles and gel formulations, respectively. The optimized formulation exhibited sustained release over 8 h. The ex vivo skin permeation studies were performed and the amount of drug retained and released through the skin were determined. The results obtained from the study proved the potentiality and suitability of this novel system to treat hyperpigmentation. © 2017, Controlled Release Society.},

abstract={Gene silencing has immense potential in the treatment of cancer. However, enhancement of its efficiency requires the development of specifically targeted and safe carrier systems. Cationic carriers are generally limited by their immunogenicity. Hence, in this study, we report hybrid liposomes encapsulating Poly (L-lysine)-siRNA complex to silence epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), highly expressed in epithelial cancers. The hybrid liposomes LL1 (Egg PC:DSPE-PEG, 10:0) and hybrid immunoliposomes LL2 (Egg PC:DSPE-PEG, 8:2) linked with EpCAM antibody as the targeting ligand showed an encapsulation efficiency of 70% and 86%, respectively. LL2 liposomes with a zeta potential of −26 mV exhibited good colloidal stability in phosphate buffered saline containing bovine serum albumin and fetal bovine serum at 37 °C. Cell uptake studies showed increased uptake of the LL2 when compared to LL1 liposomes. Finally, the hybrid immunoliposomes were evaluated for their efficacy in regressing the tumor volume in SCID mice. Eight doses each of 0.15 mg/kg, which is among the lowest reported siRNA concentrations, were administered to the animals. About 45% reduction in tumor volume was achieved after 28 days in the mice treated with LL2 when compared with the positive control and LL1 treated groups. Thus, our results demonstrate that the ‘nano–in–nano’ concept of encapsulating poly (L–Lysine) complexed EpCAM siRNA in immunoliposomes may be a promising strategy to treat EpCAM-positive epithelial cancers, especially as an adjuvant therapy. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Purpose: Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) is a progressive degenerative disease of the corneal endothelium. It is genetically heterogeneous and follows either an autosomal dominant or sporadic pattern of inheritance. Here, we have explored the association of four previously reported intronic single nucleotide polymorphisms and intronic CTG repeat expansions in TCF4 gene to FECD in an Indian cohort. Methods: The cohort consisting of 52 sporadic late-onset cases, 5 early-onset cases, and 148 controls was taken for the study. rs2286812 and rs613872 were genotyped by allele specific polymerase chain reaction (ASPCR) and PCR-based restriction digestion, respectively; rs17595731 and rs9954153 were genotyped by Taqman assay using real-time PCR. The quantitative assessment of the CTG repeat region was performed by PCR/Sanger DNA sequencing. The repeats were assessed qualitatively by short tandem repeat and triplet repeat primed PCR assays. The statistical analysis was performed using two-tailed Fisher's exact probability test. Results: SNPsrs613872 (G/T) for the 'G' allele (P value: 4.57 × 10-5) and rs17595731 (C/T) for the 'C' allele (P value: 1.87 × 10-5), respectively, showed a significant association to sporadic late-onset FECD. CTG repeat expansions were found to be associated with FECD with a P value = 2.4 × 10-3. Conclusion: rs613872, rs17595731, and CTG repeat expansions in intronic region of TCF4 are associated with increased risk of sporadic late-onset FECD in the Indian cohort studied. © 2017 Indian Journal of Ophthalmology Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.},

abstract={The electronic properties of arsenene nanotubes and nanoribbons with hydrogenation along the zigzag and armchair edges are studied using density functional theory (DFT) technique. The structural stability of hydrogenated zigzag and armchair arsenene nanostructures are confirmed with formation energy. The electronic properties of arsenene nano-conformers are described in terms of energy band structure and projected density of states spectrum. Furthermore, owing to the influence of hydrogen passivation, buckled orientation and width of arsenene nanostructures, the band gap widens in the range of 0.38–1.13 eV. The findings of the present work confirm that the electronic properties of arsenene nanomaterial, can be fine-tuned with the influence of passivation with hydrogen, zigzag or armchair border shapes and effect of the width of nanoribbons or nanotubes, which can be utilized as spintronic device and chemical sensor. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

SA is an algorithm generally used to find the global maxima or minima in a given random function. Here, we have utilized this algorithm to generate multiple QPM second harmonic generation (SHG) by distributing phase shifters suitably. In general, phase shifters are distributed in a QPM device with some specific profile along the length to generate multiple QPM SHG. Using the SA algorithm, the location of these phase shifters can be easily identified to have the desired multiple QPM with higher conversion efficiency. The methodology to generate the desired multiple QPM SHG using the SA algorithm has been discussed in detail. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Multi-drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MDRSA) remains a great challenge despite a decade of research on antimicrobial compounds against their infections. In the present study, various acyclic amines and diamines were chemically synthesized and tested for their antimicrobial as well as antibiofilm activity against MDRSA. Among all the synthesized compounds, an acyclic diamine, (2,2'-((butane-1,4-diylbis(azanediyl)bis(methylene))diphenol) designated as ADM 3, showed better antimicrobial activity (minimum inhibitory concentration at 50 μg/mL) and antibiofilm activity (MBIC50 at 5 μg/mL). In addition, ADM 3 was capable of reducing the virulence factors expression (anti-virulence). Confocal laser scanning microscope analysis of the in vitro tested urinary catheters showed biofilm reduction as well as bacterial killing by ADM 3. On the whole, our data suggest that acyclic diamines, especially ADM 3 can be a potent lead for the further studies in alternative therapeutic approaches. © 2017 Kaur, Balamurugan, Vasudevan, Jadav and Princy.},

abstract={The fast evolution of e-learning systems offers learners with huge opportunities for accessing learning activities via online. This largely provides support and improvement to the learning practices of the users. Nonetheless the problems corresponding to e-learning systems limit its application success. This is due to the fact that several learning activities like different learning materials, subjects, and learning resources, which are developing in this online world makes an e-learning system hard. It is difficult for the individual learners to choose optimized activities for their specific situations/requirements/query, since there exists no personalized service that belongs to that specific user. Recommender systems, which target a trendering personalized environment for studying materials can be utilized for resolving those issues in e-learning system. The available system proposed an e-learning personalization depending on the strategy of hybrid recommendation in cloud-based platform. It presented a recommendation system named as Protus that can do the automatic adjustment to the levels of preferences and expertise of the learners. It identifies various patterns of learning style and behaviours of the learners’ by means of testing the learning styles of the learners and then having their server logs. Nonetheless it does not accomplish optimal clustering and also does not take the trust value of user into consideration for improving the accuracy. In order to resolve this problem, the new system proposed a trust based hybrid recommendation (TBHR) strategy. Here, in this system, the learning style and the habits of the learners’ are evaluated so as to test the learning styles of the learners and then their server logs are mined. Then the noises are eliminated employing re-rating mechanisms. Depending on the various learning styles, the leaners are clustered by making use of hybrid firefly and K-means algorithms. Afterwards, the behavior and the preferences of the learners are analyzed by carrying out the mining of the sequences observed frequently by the AprioriAll algorithm. Trust-based weighted mean is utilized for analyzing the trust value of users. At last, this system finishes the customized recommendation of the learning content based on the ratings corresponding to these sequences observed frequently, rendered with the help of the Protus system. The system proposed attains a better performance in comparison with the available system in terms of mean absolute error (MAE) metric, accuracy and speed. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC},

abstract={Water distribution system supplies water to the consumers as per the designed condition if requirement of water matches with designed level. It seldom matches the designed condition during operation scenario. Uncertainty of the demand, failure of components, diversion of water, aging of pipeline, permanent increase in the demand at certain supply node, fire demand etc. creates deficit in supply. In such situations, it is important to assess actual flow that can be delivered from nodes so that the authority concerned can take up alternate steps to tackle the situation immediately. Though there are several methods available to analyze pipe networks under pressure-deficient conditions, researchers evolve new approaches or improve existing approaches that can be implemented easily with existing software. This paper proposes an improved method for pressure-driven analysis to minimize the number of addition or deletion of complementing reservoirs in complementary reservoir solution approach. Main logic of the improved method is that no supply from a node is possible if the pressure drop at a node exceeds the difference in hydraulic gradient of source and maximum pressure drop node. The proposed method is applied to three benchmark networks and results of the study show that the improved method simplifies the analysis process by reducing number of addition of complementing reservoirs. © 2017 Indian Society for Hydraulics.},

For identity authentication purpose, this approach uses medical Lump image watermark. The security of the image watermark is also enhanced by using Arnold transform before embedding into the cover image. In the embedding process, the cover medical image is decomposed into third-level DWT. Low-high frequency band (LH1) of the first level DWT is transformed by DCT and then SVD is applied to DCT coefficients. The Lump image watermark is also transformed by DCT and SVD. The singular values of the watermark image information are embedded in the singular value of the cover medical image. Further, Lump watermark is scrambled by using Arnold transform before embedding into the cover which provides the extra level of security. © RJPT All right reserved.},

Cryptographic algorithms emerged as a solution and have contributed a major role in information security system. Most of the cryptographic algorithms rely on a key for performing encryption and decryption. The key used along with the algorithm plays a vital role in ensuring the security and confidentiality of the text that is transmitted. In this work, we propose a new technique to generate a new key from the given key using different tree structures. If the key size is less than 128 bits, the given key is converted to 56 bits and then the given text is encrypted with DES followed by Blowfish algorithm.

abstract={The power quality compensator chosen in this paper is a DSTATCOM which integrates a three phase four leg Voltage Source Converter (VSC) with a DC capacitor (Cdc). A single stage Solar Photovoltaic (SPV) system is implemented for maintaining the DC link voltage (Vdc) of the Shunt Active Power Filter (SAPF). The system proposed, improves the Power Quality (PQ) of the utility system as well as feeds the solar energy extracted into the system. Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) is implemented to excerpt solar energy. The purpose of the proposed system is to mitigate harmonics and neutral current (Isn),to compensate reactive power and to maintain power factor near unity. The SAPF improves the PQ of the proposed system. The control algorithm proposed for SAPF is Neural Network (NN) based Improved Linear Sinusoidal Tracer (ILST) algorithm. An instantaneous compensation technique controls the variations in PV power of the SPV system with fast dynamic response. The proposed system is also compared with battery operated Boost Converter (BC) SPV fed SAPF system. The battery operated SPV system boost the DC link voltage and thus improves PQ throughout the day. The NN based control strategy and the SPV system are modeled, developed and validated in MATLAB SIMULINK. The simulation results justify the effectiveness of the propounded system. © 2017 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.},

abstract={Chromatin remodeling complexes facilitate the access of condensed genomic DNA during transcription, replication, and repair, by altering the histone-DNA contacts in the nucleosome structures. SWI/SNF (SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable) family of ATP dependent chromatin remodeling complexes have been documented for their tumour suppressor function. Recent studies have reported the high frequency of cancer causing mutations in this protein family. There exist multiple subunits for this complex and can form context-dependent sub-complexes. The cataloguing of individual subunits of this complex is essential for understanding their specific functions and their mechanism of action during chromatin remodeling. This would also facilitate further studies to characterize cancer causing mutations in SWI/SNF subunits. In the current study, a database containing information on the subunits of SWI/SNF-α (BRG1/BRM-Associated Factors (BAF)) and SWI/SNF-β (Polybromo-Associated BAF (PBAF)) sub classes of SWI/SNF family has been curated and catalogued. The database hosts information on 27 distinct SWI/SNF subunits from 20 organisms spanning a wide evolutionary range of eukaryotes. A non-redundant set of 522 genes coding for SWI/SNF subunits have been documented in the database. A detailed annotation on each subunit, including basic protein/gene information, protein sequence, functional domains, homologs and missense mutations of human proteins have been provided with a user-friendly graphical interface. The SWI/SNF Infobase presented here, would be a first of its kind exclusive information portal on SWI/SNF complex subunits and would be a valuable resource for the research community working on chromatin remodeling.

abstract={An auto rickshaw is a three-wheeled motor vehicle commonly found in Asia, with one front steering wheel and two driven wheels at the back. In automobiles, suspension is used to keep the wheels planted during motion. The trailing arm suspension generally found in Indian automobiles has its roll center on the ground. The vehicle’s center of gravity is above the ground, which creates a moment during vehicle turning known as the roll moment. When this roll moment exceeds a certain limit, the vehicle becomes unstable. Roll rate can be expressed as degrees per lateral acceleration of the vehicle’s sprung mass, and is influenced by factors such as wheel rate, motion ratio, and suspension rate. In order to determine an optimized three-wheeler suspension setup, a matrix selection method was used, in which every available suspension type in the market is rated based on selected suspension parameters such as handling, dynamics, and simplicity. From the overall weightage, each suspension type is analyzed and the most appropriate is selected. In order to achieve the objective of improving the overall rollover stability, certain modifications have been applied in the selected suspension design. Generally, if the roll rate of a specific vehicle axle is high, the percentage of weight transfer on the axle will also be high. By improving roll stiffness, the amount of roll can be decreased, and by optimizing the motion ratio, the roll moment can be controlled, thereby increasing the overall rollover stability. © 2017, Shanghai University and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.},

abstract={In recent years there has been a considerable growth on the integration of various renewable sources and multi types of flexible ac transmission systems (FACTS) in many practical power systems in the world. Hence the Distributed Generation is implemented in terms of using renewable source. The major problem faced in distribution network is power loss reduction and finding the proper location of distributed generation (DG). The main aim of the project deals with optimal placement of Distributed Generation with considering the Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS) devices in order to minimize the total real power loss. This paper aims at improving the voltage profile in the Distribution network by optimally placing the DG with and without FACTS devices (SVC). The optimal placement of DG is done based on Voltage Stability Index. The simulation studies of proposed test systems are performed in MATLAB coding. The outcome of the coding shows that there is an improvement in the voltage profile and also there is minimization in power loss of the distribution system. © 2006-2017 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).},

abstract={Network security is one of the primary concerned now days for large organizations. MANETs are deployed in challenging real-world environments for example, disaster management, civilian emergency operation and unmanned aircraft operation. Providing Security in this type of environment is the most challenging problems as the operation environment of such network is usually is difficult to decide. This will lead to any malicious activity that will affect the operation of the networks. Various modifications are being applied to IDS regularly to detect new attacks to handle them effectively. In this paper, we have designed a effective Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to detect the attacks in a MANET that uses modified fuzzy min max neural network in a effective manner. The aim of the proposed work is to improve the detection accuracy ratio and reduce the false positive rate. IDS is designed as a two phases technique, in which the first phase use the fuzzy min max neural network algorithm to train 60% data and test 40% data of the network. In the second phase, the modified fuzzy min max neural network algorithm is applied to 60% of train data +20% test data to form a new train data set and test the remaining 20% data collected. The proposed two phase intrusion detection method was evaluated using KDD cup data set. The experimental results showed that the proposed method is better than the other methods in terms of the detection rate, accuracy and reduced false positive rate. © 2006-2017 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).},

abstract={Protein-DNA interactions are an important class of biomolecular interactions inside the cell. Delineating the mechanisms of protein-DNA interactions and more specifically, how proteins search and bind to their specific cognate sequences has been the quest of many in the scientific community. Restriction enzymes have served as useful model systems to this end. In this work, we have investigated using molecular dynamics simulations the effect of L43K mutation on NaeI, a type IIE restriction enzyme. NaeI has two domains, the Topo and the Endo domains, each binding to identical strands of DNA sequences (GCCGGC)2. The binding of the DNA to the Topo domain is thought to enhance the binding and cleavage of DNA at the Endo domain. Interestingly, it has been found that the mutation of an amino acid that is distantly-located from the DNA cleavage site (L43K) converts the restriction endonuclease to a topoisomerase. Our investigations reveal that the L43K mutation not only induces local structural changes (as evidenced by changes in hydrogen bond propensities and differences in the percentage of secondary structure assignments of the residues in the ligase-like domain) but also alters the overall protein dynamics and DNA conformation which probably leads to the loss of specific cleavage of the recognition site. In a larger context, our study underscores the importance of considering the role of distantly-located amino acids in understanding protein-DNA interactions. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Abstract: Development of tissue-engineered construct for hepatic regeneration remains challenging due to the lack of potential milieu to control the trans-differentiation of hepatocytes. In the present study, galactose containing poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and gelatin (8:2 and 9:1) hydrogels impregnated with hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-loaded nanoparticles (241 ± 56 nm) using freeze/thaw technique was fabricated. The scaffolds with the HGF encapsulation efficiency of 57 ± 2.9% exhibited two-stage release kinetics for 30 days. Hepatogenic potential of the fabricated scaffolds were evaluated by determining the adhesion, viability, and proliferation with functional activity of rat primary hepatocytes for 28 days. Scaffolds of 8:2 ratios of PVA and gelatin maintained spheroidal morphology of hepatocytes and exhibited significantly higher metabolic secretions for 28 days (p < 0.05). Hence, galactose-based PVA-gelatin (8:2) hydrogel scaffold could be a promising alternative substrate to retain the phenotype and functional characteristics of hepatocytes due to the co-existence of bioactive motif and trophic factors. Lay Summary: The developed 3D scaffold with growth factors encapsulated nanospheres possesses characteristic features for hepatic regeneration and is proposed to be a candidate material for further invivo evaluation. © 2017, The Regenerative Engineering Society.},

abstract={Reservoir operation plays an important role in economic development of a region. Hedging operations were used for municipal, industrial, and irrigation water supplies from reservoirs in the past. However, hedging operation for hydropower reservoir operation is very rare. A practically simple and useful new form of Standard Operation Policy and a new form of hedging rules for hydropower production are introduced in this paper and demonstrated with a case study for hydropower reservoir operation of Indirasagar reservoir system in India. The performance of optimal hedging rules is compared with that of a new standard operation policies and the superiority (reliability increases by about 10%) of the hedging rules is demonstrated. When the number of decision variables is increased from 5 to 15, energy production increases by 0.7%, the spill is reduced by 16.8%, and reliability slightly decreases by 2.1%. A bi-level simulation-optimization algorithm is used for optimizing the hedging rules. For optimization, Genetic Algorithm, artificial bee colony algorithm, and imperialistic competitive algorithms are utilized. The results indicate that all the three algorithms are competitive and artificial bee colony algorithm is marginally better than the other two. © 2017 Sharif University of Technology.

abstract={Stabilization of soil can be done in number of ways like cement stabilization, chemical stabilization, etc. Generally, modification of the soil properties can be done by blending it with different materials such as lime, cement and fly powder or by reinforcing the soil. Real challenge in front of civil engineers is to lay the substructure over poor soil like clay. Stabilization of the soil is one of the conventional and most preferable ways to improve the properties of the kind of soil. Shear strengths of the stabilized soil with different fiber combinations is determined by conducting series of Unconfined Compression (UCC) tests. California Bearing Ratio (CBR) tests are also conducted on stabilized soil to determine the suitability of the best fibre reinforcement. The natural fibers used as reinforcement are coconut coir fibre and Rice husk powder whereas the synthetic fibers used as reinforcement are nylon fiber and glass fiber. The results obtained are compared and inferences are drawn towards the usability and effectiveness of best fiber reinforcement which improves the strength of the soil. In the present study, clay soil is satisfied using combination of natural and synthetic fibers. Studies have already been carried out by many researches to stabilize clay using natural or synthetic fibers. Here the best combination of fiber is found to effectively stabilize the soil. © IAEME Publication.},

abstract={An assistive system for persons with vocal impairment due to dysarthria converts dysarthric speech to normal speech or text. Because of the articulatory deficits, dysarthric speech recognition needs a robust learning technique. Representation learning is significant for complex tasks such as dysarthric speech recognition. We focus on robust representation for dysarthric speech recognition that involves recognizing sequential patterns of varying length utterances. We propose a hybrid framework that uses a generative learning based data representation with a discriminative learning based classifier. In this hybrid framework, we propose to use Example Specific Hidden Markov Models (ESHMMs) to obtain log-likelihood scores for a dysarthric speech utterance to form fixed dimensional score vector representation. This representation is used as an input to discriminative classifier such as support vector machine.The performance of the proposed approach is evaluatedusingUA-Speechdatabase.The recognitionaccuracy is much better than the conventional hidden Markov model based approach and Deep Neural Network-Hidden Markov Model (DNN-HMM). The efficiency of the discriminative nature of score vector representation is proved for 'very low' intelligibility words. © 2001-2011 IEEE.},

abstract={In telemedicine, medical images are broadcast in a secured manner and received correctly without any loss. This paper proposes a novel reversible watermarking technique in transform domain for medical images without any additional key information. In traditional transform based watermarking method, the embedding capacity is less also requires additional key information for lossless recovery of the original image at the extraction side. This paper overcomes that difficulty in transform domain by using a novel hybrid reversible watermarking algorithm to increase the embedding capacity. Integer wavelet transform (IWT) and Discrete Gould transform (DGT) are used to develop a secure and reversible medical image watermarking. At the sender side, watermark information is embedded within a wavelet sub band using DGT and at the receiver side, the embedded watermark is extracted and the exact original medical image is reconstructed without any additional information. Experimental results for medical images and ordinary images show that the proposed method meets out the requirements of the image watermarking system such as imperceptibility, capacity, reversibility and robustness.

abstract={This paper deals with design and simulation of a three-phase shunt hybrid power filter consisting of a pair of 5th and 7th selective harmonic elimination passive power filters connected in series with a conventional active power filter with reduced kVA rating. The objective is to enhance the power quality in a distribution network feeding variety of non-linear, time-varying and unbalanced loads. The theory and modelling of the entire power circuit in terms of synchronously rotating reference frame and leading to a non-linear control scheme is presented. This work involves introduction of individual fuzzy logic controllers for d and q axis current control and for voltage regulation of the DC link capacitor. The simulation schematic covering the power and control circuits have been developed taking into account severe harmonic distortion caused by non-linear and unbalanced loads. The effectiveness of the fuzzy logic controller for the compensation of harmonics and reactive power has been verified by successive simulation runs and analysis of the results. The proposed controller is also able to compensate the distortion generated by the voltage- and current-fed non-linear loads, unbalanced and dynamically varying loads. Further, excellent regulation of the DC link voltage is accomplished, which significantly contributes to improvement of power quality. © 2017, Indian Academy of Sciences.},

Therefore, herein we demonstrate AgNPs synthesis by conventional bioreduction approach using quercetin compound from Clitoria ternateaL. methanolic petal extract. Bioreduction of silver nitrate (AgNO3) with the quercetin extract, was incubated for 240 min and the mixture were characterized by UV–Vis spectroscopy, FTIR, XRD, DLS, SEM, EDS and Zeta potential analysis. The results were confirmed the presence of silver ion. Furthermore, the biosynthesized AgNPs possess significant antimicrobial activity against multidrug resistant bacteria such as, Staphylococcus aureus and Shigella sp. with maximum concentration (100 µl) showed strong inhibitory action. In addition, the hybrid AgNPs showed potential Quorum Sensing Inhibition activity with different concentration (25–100 µg/ml) against the AHL-mediated violacein production in C. violaceum (14–86%) and biofilm formation (19–92%), extracellular polymeric substances (16–72%), protease (17–93%) productions in S. aureus and. It was again confirmed by spectrophotometry and microscopy. Further, the synthesized hybrid AgNPs showed less hemolysis activity 4.58%, compared with American Society for Testing and Materials range &lt;5%. Threfore our findings recommend that the biosynthesized AgNPs could be more hemocompatible for drug delivery applications. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

Insulation failure is, by far, the costlier event with an average cost of about $150,000 (1999) per outage [1].

abstract={In a nuclear power plant, periodic sensor calibration is necessary to ensure the correctness of measurements. Those sensors which have gone out of calibration can lead to malfunction of the plant, possibly causing a loss in revenue or damage to equipment. Continuous sensor status monitoring is desirable to assure smooth running of the plant and reduce maintenance costs associated with unnecessary manual sensor calibrations. In this paper, a method is proposed to detect and identify any degradation of sensor performance. The validation process consists of two steps: (i) residual generation and (ii) fault detection by residual evaluation. Singular value decomposition (SVD) and Euclidean distance (ED) methods are used to generate the residual and evaluate the fault on the residual space, respectively. This paper claims that SVD-based fault detection method is better than the well-known principal component analysis-based method. The method is validated using data from fast breeder test reactor. © 2017, Indian Academy of Sciences.},

abstract={Malaria is a precarious disease and a serious illness that can become life threatening very fast and can be incurable if not treated on time. According to the World Health Organization, Malaria causes 150–250 million infections and an estimated more than a million deaths each year. Microscopic image capture followed by visual observation as per the manual is the gold standard method for diagnosis of malaria. However, due to subjectivity and the complexity of manual assessment, microscopic diagnosis of malaria is tiring, time consuming and subject to human error. In this study, we have developed a novel automatic high performance method with minimal human dependence for detection and quantitation of malaria infected Red Blood Cells (RBC). The parasites detection test to identify malaria was computed using digital image processing techniques. This automated quantitation procedure was done in three parts: Segmentation, Identification and Detection. The methods used for the quantitation were Six Sigma threshold for segmenting Region of Interest followed by modified Hough transform to identify and count RBCs, and Kapur's threshold method to detect malaria parasite infected RBCs. The developed package using Microsoft® VB.NET 2008 framework is executed on various Giemsa stained thin blood smears digitally acquired using a charge coupled device attached to a microscope. Following analysis performed on seven sets of thin blood smear images, the values of Precision, Recall and F-measures obtained were 96%, 97% and 97% respectively. This is the first attempt to use a combination of Six Sigma threshold, Chess-Board distance, Hough transform and Kapur's threshold to find the RBCs by deriving information from the image itself. Further, Kapur's entropy measure was successfully applied to distinguish parasitized from un-infected cells. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH},

abstract={This paper proposes a machine vision scheme for denoising, feature space gradient preserving, and detecting weld defects in noisy weld X-radiography images; particularly, for the images that are in low-contrast and contain noises. The detection of small weld defects present on noisy image is extremely difficult in non-destructive testing through machine vision. The presence of high gradient magnitude and the low intensity in the feature space of a noisy image are the main characteristics of weld defects. These characteristics can be considered to refine and obtain noise-free images for detection of weld defects. This study proposes a modified anisotropic diffusion model, which considers a local probability value of gray-level and an adaptive threshold parameter in diffusion coefficient function to adjust the implication of low edge gradient of the feature space from the noisy image. Furthermore, an entropy based stopping criterion has been introduced to terminate the diffusion process. This proposed model is compared with the existing models, and its performance is evaluated through Mean Square Error (MSE), Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Entropy (E) and Mean Structural Similarity (MSSIM) measures. Experimental results confirm the reliability of the proposed model. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Adhesins are bacterial proteins with host cell adhesive properties. These proteins occur in diverse architectures, ranging from capsules, vesicles, pili, fimbri, to enzymes. These proteins interact with host cell surface receptor proteins, for cross-membrane- trafficking and the invasion of host cells. Thus, they lead to inflammation and pathogenesis, of chronic as well as acute type. Inhibition of adhesin-mediated immune activation can be possible by mannose supplementation, assembly disruption, and host receptor blockage, among other approaches. Almost all bacterial pathogenesis is mediated by adhesins, yet when elaborated by normal flora, they might also be important for the exclusion of pathogens. For their ubiquity in bacterial pathogenesis, these lectin-like virulence proteins have been drug targets and vaccine components. Adhesins hold the clue for bacterial persistence and drug resistance as well, which can be detected through the annotation of hypothetical genes, the coding genes with sparsely-characterized functionality. This work takes a unique perspective on adhesins for better management of infectious diseases. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS},

abstract={Worldwide researchers and scientists are taking efforts to develop novel structured highly crystallized nanomaterials to fabricate devices for various applications. In this report, we demonstrate the synthesis of self-originated single phase Titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanorods embedded nanopillar on nanotent grain under simple hydrothermal method. Synthesized TiO2 nanopillars are in single crystalline tetragonal crystal structure with rutile phase. Understanding the fundamental crystal nucleation and growth mechanism is more critical in the semiconducting oxide thin films with controlled size and morphological features. The growth mechanism of TiO2 nanopillars on the surface of Fluorine doped Tin Oxide (FTO) substrate is explained in support of FESEM and AFM images. The optical emission properties are studied with photoluminescence spectroscopy. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Identifying key cellular events that facilitate stem cell function and tissue organization is crucial for understanding the process of regeneration. Planarians are powerful model system to study regeneration and stem cell (neoblast) function. Here, using planaria, we show that the initial events of regeneration, such as epithelialization and epidermal organization are critically regulated by a novel cytoplasmic poly A-binding protein, SMED-PABPC2. Knockdown of smed-pabpc2 leads to defects in epidermal lineage specification, disorganization of epidermis and ECM, and deregulated wound healing, resulting in the selective failure of neoblast proliferation near the wound region. Polysome profiling suggests that epidermal lineage transcripts, including zfp-1, are translationally regulated by SMED-PABPC2. Together, our results uncover a novel role for SMED-PABPC2 in the maintenance of epidermal and ECM integrity, critical for wound healing and subsequent processes for regeneration. © 2017.

abstract={Retinoblastoma (RB), a childhood cancer, is caused by biallelic mutation of the RB1 gene, but its development is not clearly understood. Furthermore, the presence of a cancer stem cell subpopulation in RB might impact its treatment. PIWI protein, known for its role in stem cell self-renewal, is aberrantly expressed in cancers. We examined the role of the PIWI-like protein HIWI2 in RB and its effect on the stem cell markers in cells of the RB line, Y79. The expression of HIWI2 is significantly increased in Y79 compared with its level in HeLa and ARPE19 cells. The stem cell markers Oct-3/4, Nanog and Sox-2 were not altered upon HIWI2 knockdown in Y79 cells. Interestingly, OTX2 was significantly downregulated in the absence of HIWI2. Otx2 transcripts also decreased in HIWI2-silenced Y79 and ARPE19 cells. Moreover, silencing HIWI2 in Y79 accumulated the cells at G2-M phase and reduced the levels of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and the tumor suppressor, p16. Our results demonstrate that HIWI2 is aberrantly expressed in Y79 cells and silencing of HIWI2 downregulates OTX2, suggesting that HIWI2 might play a role in the progression of RB. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={Pharmacological agents given at the time of reperfusion can protect the heart from ischemia reperfusion injury (IR). Being a calcium chelator, antioxidant and mitochondrial potassium channel modulator, sodium thiosulfate (STS) was chosen to treat myocardial IR injury. Isolated rat heart model was used to induce IR injury and the hemodynamic changes were monitored using PowerLab (AD Instruments, Australia). STS at a dose of 1 mM given at the early stage of reperfusion significantly reduced the infarct size and recovered the failing heart from reperfusion injury. Its action was based on reduction of apoptosis as evidenced from decreased activity of caspase-3 in the myocardium, lowered expression of casp-3 and PARP, which was supported by absence of significant DNA fragmentation and histological derangement of fibers compared to the injury control. An evaluation of the inter-dependency of H2S and STS biosynthesis in the STS treated groups showed no significant changes in the level of STS, H2S and rhodanese, except the cystathionine gamma lyase activity that improved upon treatment. The mechanism underlying the antiapoptotic, mitochondrial preservation and antioxidant effects of STS were related to the biosynthesis of H2S. The fact that inhibition of cystathionine gamma lyase limited the STS mediated cardio protection supports this observation. © 2017},

abstract={The development of innovative devices needs novel, small size, low cost, and high characteristic functional materials. Hence, finding new materials of multifunctional properties is always a hot issue to the materials scientist community. In this context, nanoparticles (NPs) have great significance toward practical applications. For this, over the last few decades, the preparation of nanostructures has been attracting considerable interest [Zhou 2015]. Particularly, magnetic NPs are a topic of growing attention because of their versatile applications in magnetic devices, drug delivery, magnetic separation, MRI contrast enhancement, magnetic fluids, hyperthermia, magnetic sensors, catalysis, microwave absorbers, inductor cores, etc. [Schooneveld 2012, Moghimi 2013, Shokuhfar 2014, Kandapallil 2015, Sharma 2015, Zhou 2015, Ishizaki 2016]. In addition, the development of bimetallic NPs (alloy) based on Fe, Co, and Ni has received much recent attention because of their novel catalytic, magnetic, and optical properties, which could be considerably different from those of their constituent single metallic materials [Moghimi 2013, Sharma 2015]. Various properties of alloy can be displayed by changing the composition of the alloy [Basith 2014, Moghimi 2014, Kozhitov 2015]. Moreover, Ni-Fe alloy NPs have attracted significant research interest because of their high magnetic permeability and low hysteresis loss [Ban 2006]. A small variation in the composition of Ni-Fe alloy can cause considerable changes in the magnetic moment and coercivity of the alloy [Wu 2005]. Thus, the controlled composition is a key factor for tuning the magnetic properties of the alloy particles toward desired applications. Various synthesis methods including hydrothermal, thermal decomposition, microemulsion, solution phase reduction of precursor materials, and wet chemistry have been reported for the synthesis of Ni-Fe NPs [Cushing 2004, Wu 2005, Liao 2006, Wei 2006, Chen 2009]. Although all the above-mentioned methods somehow significantly contribute to synthesize Ni-Fe NPs with various structures, shape, and properties, the use of either complex solution process or involvement of toxic surfactants and high cost still remains a challenge. On the other hand, the sonofragmentation technique is a onestep synthesis technique to produce NPs directly from bulk powder, which is simple, low cost, rapid, and environmental friendly [Basith 2014, Basith 2017]. Hence, sonofragmentation technique could be an alternative cost-effective way to synthesize Ni-Fe nanoalloys. In this investigation, we have demonstrated a simple cost-effective and nontoxic sonofragmentation technique to synthesize superparamagnetic Ni-Fe alloy NPs. The compositions of the Ni-Fe alloy are varied by changing the precursor concentration to obtain controlled magnetic properties. The morphology, structure, elemental composition, and magnetic properties of the synthesized nanoalloys are investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), respectively. © 2017 IEEE.

abstract={SCC has emerged as an inevitable option in situations where there is scarcity of skilled labour at construction sites. In the present paper an attempt was made to produce SCC with three different supplementary cementitious materials as a partial substitute to cement in binary blend. Cement was replaced with ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) (25%, 50% &amp; 75%), Metakaolin (MK) (10%, 20% &amp; 30%) and Silica Fume (SF) (5%, 10% &amp; 15%) respectively. Durability studies such as resistance against acid attack, sulphate attack, water absorption and sorptivity were done to evaluate the suitability of mineral admixtures. Experimental results of binary blend SCC were compared with concrete (NVC) to understand the effect of mineral admixtures. The results indicated low water absorption and lesser volume of permeable voids in MK based SCC compared to NVC. GGBFS based SCC (with 50% Substitution) exhibited better resistance against acid attack than NVC. No significant difference in weight loss was observed for concrete immersed in Na2So4 solution. SF with 10% substitution and MK with 20% substitution gave good results compared to control SCC. Hence it is concluded that SCC could be produced with supplementary cementitious materials without compromising on durability. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The electronic and adsorption properties of three different alcohol molecules namely methanol, ethanol and 1-propanol vapors on MoS 2 nanosheet is investigated using DFT method. The structural stability of MoS 2 nanosheet is ascertained with formation energy. The adsorption properties of alcohol molecules on MoS 2 base material is discussed in terms of average energy gap variation, Mulliken charge transfer, energy band gap and adsorption energy. The prominent adsorption sites of methanol, ethanol and 1-propanol vapors on MoS 2 nanosheet are studied in atomistic level. The projected density of states (PDOS) spectrum gives the clear insights on the electronic properties of MoS 2 nanosheet. The PDOS and energy band structure confirmed the adsorption of alcohol vapors on MoS 2 nanosheet. The variation in the band structure and PDOS is noticed upon adsorption of methanol, ethanol and 1-propanol molecules on MoS 2 nanosheet. The PDOS spectrum also reveals the variation in peak maxima owing to transfer of electron between alcohol molecules and MoS 2 base material. The adsorption of 1-propanol vapor on MoS 2 nanosheet is observed to be more favorable than other alcohol molecules. The findings confirm that monolayer MoS 2 nanosheet can be used to detect the presence of alcohol vapors in the environment. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={A wireless gas sensor node with nanosensor for rapid in-situ detection of ammonia gas is developed and an analytical model for precise and accurate quantification of ammonia in any industrial or closed environment has been proposed. A nanosensor is preferred due to its highly selective and sensitive properties for target gases. In this work, a traditional sensing circuit is replaced with a single sensor based voltage divider sensing circuit for signal feeding to microcontroller. As the room temperature operated chemiresistive ammonia sensor has eliminated the use of micro heater, overall power consumption is reduced. A low sensing power consumption of 56 mW was observed and the performance of non-linear model based gas detection algorithm was analysed using Relative Prediction Error (RPE), Root Mean Square Error for Cross Validation (RMSECV) and percentage recovery (% recovery). Best performance metrics values (RPE = 0.04%, RMSECV = 6.128, % recovery = 99.273) were obtained.

Out-of-calibration sensor data can direct to take inappropriate action of system monitoring and controlling application. Continuous sensor status monitoring is desirable to assure smooth running of the plant and reduce maintenance costs associated with unnecessary manual sensor calibrations. In this paper, an online sensor fault detection technique is proposed using Auto-Associative Kernel Regression (AAKR) and Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test. The AAKR method is used to approximate the data and the GLRT is applied as a metric to detect the faulty sensor on the residual space, the deviation of approximated data from the original. This paper claims that the AAKR-GLRT based fault detection method is better than the PCA-Q-statistic. The method is validated by the real data from the Fast Breeder Test Reactor (FBTR). © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={In the majority of civil engineering applications, the basic building blocks were the masonry units. Those masonry units were developed as a monolithic structure by plastering process with the help of binding agents namely mud, lime, cement and their combinations. In recent advancements, the mortar study plays an important role in crack repairs, structural rehabilitation, retrofitting, pointing and plastering operations. The rheology of mortar includes flowable, passing and filling properties which were analogous with the behaviour of self compacting concrete. In self compacting (SC) mortar cubes, the cement was replaced by mineral admixtures namely silica fume (SF) from 5% to 20% (with an increment of 5%), metakaolin (MK) from 10% to 30% (with an increment of 10%) and ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) from 25% to 75% (with an increment of 25%). The ratio between cement and fine aggregate was kept constant as 1: 2 for all normal and self compacting mortar mixes. The accelerated curing namely electric oven curing with the differential temperature of 128°C for the period of 4 hours was adopted. It was found that the compressive strength obtained from the normal and electric oven method of curing was higher for self compacting mortar cubes than normal mortar cube. The cement replacement by 15% SF, 20% MK and 25%GGBS obtained higher strength under both curing conditions. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Strengthening of existing damaged structures is one of the leading studies in civil engineering. The purpose of retrofitting is to structurally treat the member with an aim to restore the structure to its original strength. The focus of this project is to study the behaviour of damaged Reinforced Concrete beam retrofitted with Reactive Powder Concrete (RPC) Overlay. Reinforced concrete beams of length 1200 mm, width 100 mm and depth 200 mm were casted with M30 grade of concrete in the laboratory and cured for 28 days. One beam is taken as control and are tested under two point loading to find out ultimate load. Remaining beams are subjected to 90 % ultimate load of control beams. The partially damaged beams are retrofitted with Reactive Powder Concrete Overlay at the full tension face of the beam and side overlay depends upon the respectable retrofitting techniques with 10 mm and 20 mm thick layer to find optimum. Materials like steel fibres are added to enhance the ductility by eliminating coarse particle for homogeneity of the structure. Finally, the modes of failure for retrofitted beams are analysed experimentally under two point loading & compared the results with Control beam. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The need for alternative material for the cement is arising and being compromised by many engineering researchers. However, the growing demand and surging prices of raw materials challenges the constructional field. India, being one of the largest agricultural economy, produces a quantitative volume of agro-waste that is being dumped. In the conventional concrete production, coarse aggregate (CA) plays an important filler material. The initial study on date seed as a replacement for CA was not successful. This study primarily focuses on Date seed ash as a replacement material for ordinary Portland cement. OPC was replaced by Date Palm Seed Ash (DPSA) in the ratio up to 10% in terms of 2% interval. The main objective of this paper was to study the variation of strength properties of mortar by DPSA in specified ratio along with curing period of 3,7,14 and 28 days. The stress strain behavior has indicated a significant improvement. The overall results indicated the increase in replacing ratio, decreases the strength properties. However the physical, chemical and mechanical properties increased gradually in strength in minimal ratio. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The choice of natural fibres for soil stabilization provides an economic, safe and eco-friendly alternative to improve the properties of soil. They are an important step forward toward sustainable development. An attempt was made to study the influence of the random addition of untreated coconut fibres on the short term strength of soil, its stress-strain behavior, compaction characteristics and index properties. The soil selected for the study is a highly compressible clay sample with a liquid limit of 52.5 % and plasticity index of 38 %. The soil has no organic content. The study reveals that the compaction curves tend to shift to the right side, indicating more plastic behavior with the addition of fibres. The addition of fibres also reorient the soil structure to a more dispersed fashion. A significant increase in the unconfined compressive strength is also observed. An increase of nearly 51 % in the unconfined compressive strength is observed at 0.75 % coir inclusion. The stress-strain behavior of the soil shows a shift toward more plastic behavior. The mode of failure of the soil specimen is by cracking and with fibre inclusion, length of the failure cracks is restrained as the fibre tends to hold the cracks together, resulting in shorter cracks, with significant bulging of the specimen at failure. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The dry period agriculture is inevitable both for the farmers for their earning, and for the soil for its fertility by crop-rotation. In tropical countries like INDIA, dry period agriculture becomes difficult because of less (or) no rain fall. Hence a simple water balancing model for irrigation scheduling, using the measure "Volumetric Reliability" is prepared in this paper, with the storage and inflow of a reservoir both for the dry and wet periods. The case-study is done for a reservoir in INDIA with thirty one years of hydrological data(from 1982 to 2012). The objective of this paper is to prepare a simple water balance model taking 10 days periods of demand and supply for ID crop(Irrigated Dry crop, ground nut) with usage of volumetric reliability concept for the periods of deficiency and adoption of less water requirement crops to reduce the water-stress during critical periods of crop growth, and finally arrive at a feasible allocation schedule for the success of agriculture and the yield throughout the year both for wet and dry crops with the available storage on the start of irrigation for a particular year. The reservoir is divided for storages such as full, deficient and critical storages. The starting storage for the dry period from January is used after adequate allocation for wet crops, the quantity for riparian rights and for drinking water, for the sustainability. By the water-balancing, the time-series for thirty one years, it is found that for twenty two years the demand for the ID crops is satisfied with the storage in the reservoir, and in the remaining years of deficient inflows, for three years (1986,1996,2004)the demand is managed by using the safe reliability factor for demand which can nullify the deficit in demand for the whole supply period. But it is genuine to assure that the reduction in the amount of water for each 10 days periods should not exceed the survival limit of the crop. Necessary soil-moisture must be ensured in the crop in its root zone.. A safe volumetric reliability factor of 0.75 is taken in this attempt to extend the success of dry period agriculture. The soil moisture balance in the clayey loam soil due to continuous irrigation can manage the deficiency, so that the soil-water does not go below the wilting point but must be checked with the soil-moisture sensors. The methods to reduce the evaporation from the soil, such as usage of drip irrigation and the mulching, which can reduce the crop water requirements in comparison with the conventional irrigation which is being followed at present in the spot of the case-study is suggested. In addition to these methods less water requirement crops like flowers, vegetables having less crop-period and provision of windbreak to reduce evapo-transpiration rates and other efficient methods of water management can make success of dry period agriculture even in the years critical storage level in the reservoir. The rainfall is not taken in this model which if in a year with ample quantity can be used for pre-sowing and for managing the water-stress. Augmentation of water with ground water, percolation tank can boost the level of success of agriculture. As the irrigation water allocation for the whole year, particularly for the ID crops is prepared for the full, deficient and critical storages, this paper can help to achieve sustainable growth of crops throughout the year. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Bond behavior between GFRP bars and concrete is the most important parameter for constructing corrosion free structures by implementing the material. Serviceability of reinforced concrete structures are controlled by bond behavior. GFRP materials behave differently from reinforcing steel in terms of bond. They are of non-homogeneous and anisotropic. Due to this outstanding behavior, there is a difference in transfer of loads between GFRP bars and concrete which made it as an idealized choice of a material. In the present work, the bond strength of GFRP bars in normal and high strength concrete was studied. In total, 12 specimens containing 12 mm, 16 mm diameter rebars which were embedded in 150 mm x 150 mm x 150 mm cubes were investigated. The specimens were subjected to direct tension pull out test in accordance with IS 2770 part 1. The comparison of bond properties of GFRP rebar in normal and high strength concrete showed that pull out load of non-metallic rebar fell well within the range. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Concrete is the important construction material and it is used in the construction industry due to its high compressive strength and its durability. Now a day's various studies have been conducted to make concrete with waste material with the intention of reducing cost and unavailability of conventional materials. This paper investigates the strength properties of concrete specimens cast using waste marble dust as replacement of fine aggregate. The marble pieces are finely crushed to powdered and the gradation is compared with conventional fine aggregate. Concrete specimen were cast using wmd in the laboratory with different proportion (25%, 50% and 100%) by weight of cement and from the studies it reveals that addition of waste marble dust as a replacement of fine aggregate marginally improves compressive, tensile and flexural strength in concrete. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Slurry infiltrated fibrous concrete is one of the new advanced concrete composite which differs from method of fabrication and composition of the matrix. Extensive research is being carried out on alternative binders or supplements to cement aiming to reduce environmental impact. However, little has been published to investigate the structural behaviour of SIFCON incorporating with mineral admixtures, particularly as regards its ultrahigh ductility, which may alter the mode of failure from brittle to the more desirable ductile. An experimental study was carried out to investigate the flexural behavior of SIFCON containing three different percentage of fibre content 6%,8% &10% with incorporation of optimum dosage of blast furnace slag replaced by cement. Strength characteristics such as Compressive strength and splitting tensile strength test were carry out for SIFCON incorporating 10% of fibre content and different percentage of slag (0, 15, 30, 45, 60%&75%) to optimize the replacement level. The test results found that the maximum strengths were attained at 30% of blast furnace slag replaced by cement. To study the flexural behavior of SIFCON beam of size 1.2x0.1x0.2m containing different percentages (6%, 8% & 10%) fibre content incorporating with and without the optimum percentage of slag were cast and tested. Both flexural strength and Load displacement characteristics of the specimens were studied under flexure. The outcomespresentedfromtest resultshave been compared. The test results reveals that the flexural strength, toughness, ductility and stiffness characteristics were significantly improved due to incorporation of optimum dosage of slag enhancing when compared to without mineral admixtures also compared to conventional concrete(RCC). Major conclusions were drawn from the investigations which are presented. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

In this work an attempt has been made to study the effect of nano alumina on the properties of concrete composite. In order to investigate the effect of nano-alumina on the mechanical strength of cement composite, the specimens with different volume percentages (0%, 0.5%, 0.75% and 1%) nano-alumina, in each proportion three sample were cast totally making 58 specimens and after 28 days of curing they were tested. Based on experiment, the compressive strength of concrete cubes was all increased by incorporating nano alumina into matrix, when the fraction of nano alumina was 1% of the cement by weight the compressive strength of composites increased by 33.14% at 28 days. The test results showed that addition of nano alumina enhanced the compressive strength and reduced the initial setting time of concrete composite. Micro analysis was carried out by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS).The studies indicated that nano particle was uniformly distributed by improving the microstructure of concrete. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Construction of pavements uses various filling materials and due to the cost factor, the local soil is used for pavement construction. The strength of the soil is improved by stabilisation. This stabilisation increases the load bearing capacities of soil for heavy wheeled vehicle traffic. GGBS, silica fume, rice husk are the basic waste materials used as a waste material, which improves the quality of soil and reduces the cost of pavements. In this study, a detailed investigation is made on the Ground Granulated Blast-furnace Slag (GGBS), activated by lime, in the stabilisation of low bearing capacity sand and clay soils collected from Thanjavur district (Budalur, Sengipatti, Vallam and Palliahgraharam villages). The tests are carried out as per Indian Standards. The test procedures separated into two phases, namely Stage-I and Stage-II. In Stage-I the soil tests include soil type, particle size distribution, soil index properties, standard proctor tests, shear tests and CBR test. In Stage-II the soil tests include shear tests and CBR test for the suitable required proportions of GGBS along with lime in the collected soil samples. The test results from stage-I and stage-II are compared and from the study, it is inferred that the application of GGBS is a useful material for soil stabilisation. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The primary component in any structure is concrete, that exist in buildings and bridges. In present situation, a serious problems faced by construction industry is exhaustive use of raw materials. Recent times, various methods are being adopted to limit the use of concrete. In structural elements like beams, polythene balls can be induced to reduce the usage of concrete. A simply supported reinforced concrete beam has two zones, one above neutral axis and other below neutral axis. The region below neutral axis is in tension and above neutral axis is in compression. As concrete is weak in tension, steel reinforcements are provided in tension zone. The concrete below the neutral axis acts as a stress transfer medium between the compression zone and tension zone. The concrete above the neutral axis takes minimum stress so that we could partially replace the concrete above neutral axis by creating air voids using recycled polythene balls. Polythene balls of varying diameters of 75 mm, 65 mm and 35 mm were partially replaced in compression zone. Hence the usage of concrete in beams and self-weight of the beams got reduced considerably. The Load carrying capacity, Deflection of beams and crack patterns were studied and compared with conventional reinforced concrete beams. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Water body is an important infrastructure of urban landscape. Water bodies like tanks and ponds are constructed to harvest rainwater for local use. Such water bodies serve many environmental functions including flood and soil erosion control and are useful for irrigation, drinking water supply and groundwater recharge. A large number of water bodies recently have been lost due to anthropogenic activities and the remaining water bodies are under stress due to risk of degradation. There are many phases to solve or control the problem; starting from stopping the abuse, to restoration to monitoring and maintenance. In this situation, the existing urban and peri-urban water bodies are to be preserved and rehabilitated. In this study, policy requirements for the protection (preservation and rehabilitation) of water bodies are analyzed with special reference to Thanjavur city. Thanjavur city has many water bodies and moat around the Big-Temple and the palace, and stands as an evidence for water management in ancient days. These water bodies are to be protected and used properly for sustainable growth of the city. This paper envisages the following three: (a) need for evaluation of hydraulic and hydrologic properties of the water bodies for conserving rainwater and controlling flood water in the existing urban water bodies; (b) need for evaluation of potential of socio-environmental services by the water bodies, and (c) need for developing a relative importance index for protection of water bodies to prioritize the remedial actions. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The use of Cold Formed Steel (CFS) sections as structural members is widely accepted because of its light nature. However, the load carrying capacity of these sections will be less compared to hot rolled sections. This study is meant to analyze the possibility of strengthening cold formed members by wrapping it with Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) laminates. Light gauge steel columns of cross sectional dimensions 100mm x 50mm x 3.15mm were taken for this study. The effective length of the section is about 750mm. A total of 8 specimens including the control specimen is tested under axial and eccentric loading. The columns were tested keeping both ends hinged. For both loading cases the buckling behaviour, ultimate load carrying capacity and load-deflection characteristics of the CFS columns were analyzed. The GFRP laminates were wrapped on columns in three different ways such that wrapping the outer surface of web and flange throughout the length of specimen, wrapping the outer surface of web alone throughout the length of specimen and wrapping the outer surface of web and flange for the upper half length of the specimen where the buckling is expected. For both loading cases, the results indicated that the column with wrapping at the outer surface of web and flange throughout the length of specimen provides better strength for it. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The studies on durability of concrete have attracted attention in the recent years and its long term strength depends on quality of ingredients used in production of concrete. Now a days, the availability of ingredients is limited and in order to overcome this problem, research studies focuses on some alternate materials in the concrete production process. Also, Incorporation of waste materials consumes less energy leading to reduction of emission of green house gases. The application of fly ash and cow dung ash as a pozzolanic binder instead of cement and coir fibers finds extensive application in the manufacturing process of building materials. In this project an attempt has been made to utilize cow dung ash and coconut fiber as a replacement material of cement in the production of concrete. The cement is partially replaced with cow dung ash by about 2.5, 3 & 3.5 % by weight and with 1% of coconut fiber. The Compressive and Tensile strengths of concrete were found at different curing periods (7,14 & 28 days). From this study, it is inferred that these replacements will have a reasonable improvement in the strength properties of concrete by about 55-70%. The substitution of CDA, CF is economical in terms of cost and this usage eliminates the problem of landfills, reducing the environmental risk, maintaining the ecological balance, which is very much required for our nation. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={High performance concrete (HPC) is similar to High strength concrete (HSC).It is because of lowering of water to cement ratio, which is needed to attain high strength and generally improves other properties. This concrete contains one or more cementitious materials such as fly ash, Silica fume or ground granulated blast furnace slag and usually a super plasticizer. The term 'high performance' is somewhat different because the essential feature of this concrete is that it's ingredients and proportions are specifically chosen so as to have particularly appropriate properties for the expected use of the structure such as high strength and low permeability. Usage of nano scale properties such as Nano SiO2 can result in dramatically improved properties from conventional grain size materials of same chemical composition. This project is more interested in evaluate the behaviour of nano silica in concrete for 5%, 10%, and 15% volume fraction of cement. Flexural test for beams were conducted with two point loads, at different percentage as mentioned above.

abstract={This paper presents the partial and complete replacement of over burnt brick bat (OBB) 20-30mm as coarse aggregate in the concrete. OBB are formed at extreme heating to a temperature not less than 1600 degree Celsius. The burnt bricks change from red to blue-black ceramics color. The series of tests are conducted to study the effect of 0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% replacement of coarse aggregate with over burnt bricks. Totally 36numbers of 150mm concrete cube with 5 different percentage replacement mix are cast and tested and three numbers of the flexural beam. In durability aspects, water absorption and sorptivity were tested. Experimental results found 25-50% of overburnt brick bat wastes can be replaced with the normal and mass concrete without quality compromisation. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The Experimental investigations have revealed significant mismatches between analytical estimates and experimentally measured deflections of tower structures. Conductor and groundwire tension and sag are influenced by the peak and cross-arm deflections and hence accurate estimates of the tower deflections at service loads are of key interest. This paper presents a nonlinear formulation for analysis of tower structures in an attempt to close the mismatch. The analysis includes geometric nonlinear behaviour of the tower, material nonlinearity as well as leg member buckling in compression. The nonlinear analysis reveals that the ultimate collapse loads of the towers tested to failure can be predicted. However the, deflections continue to have a mismatch despite nonlinear analysis. This demonstrates the need for inclusion of other parameters to be able to reduce the error of analytical deflection estimates. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Reservoir operation is the one of the important filed of water resource management. Innovative techniques in water resource management are focussed at optimizing the available water and in decreasing the environmental impact of water utilization on the natural environment. In the operation of multi reservoir system, efficient regulation of the release to satisfy the demand for various purpose like domestic, irrigation and hydropower can lead to increase the benefit from the reservoir as well as significantly reduces the damage due to floods. Hedging rule is one of the emerging techniques in reservoir operation, which reduce the severity of drought by accepting number of smaller shortages. The key objective of this paper is to maximize the minimum power production and improve the reliability of water supply for municipal and irrigation purpose by using hedging rule. In this paper, Type II two-point linear hedging rule is attempted to improve the operation of Bargi reservoir in the Narmada basin in India. The results obtained from simulation of hedging rule is compared with results from Standard Operating Policy, the result shows that the application of hedging rule significantly improved the reliability of water supply and reliability of irrigation release and firm power production. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Rainfall is a prime input for various engineering design such as hydraulic structures, bridges and culverts, canals, storm water sewer and road drainage system. The detailed statistical analysis of each region is essential to estimate the relevant input value for design and analysis of engineering structures and also for crop planning. A rain gauge station located closely in Trichy district is selected for statistical analysis where agriculture is the prime occupation. The daily rainfall data for a period of 30 years is used to understand normal rainfall, deficit rainfall, Excess rainfall and Seasonal rainfall of the selected circle headquarters. Further various plotting position formulae available is used to evaluate return period of monthly, seasonally and annual rainfall. This analysis will provide useful information for water resources planner, farmers and urban engineers to assess the availability of water and create the storage accordingly. The mean, standard deviation and coefficient of variation of monthly and annual rainfall was calculated to check the rainfall variability. From the calculated results, the rainfall pattern is found to be erratic. The best fit probability distribution was identified based on the minimum deviation between actual and estimated values. The scientific results and the analysis paved the way to determine the proper onset and withdrawal of monsoon results which were used for land preparation and sowing. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Urban planners and stakeholders require knowledge about the effectiveness of city-scale climate adaptation measures in order to develop climate resilient cities and to push forward the political process for the implementation of climate adaptation strategies. This study examines the impact of modifications in orientation of buildings with respect to heat load. Heat load calculation is a mathematical process to determine the best capacity, application and style of HVAC system. The purpose is to ensure energy efficiency while also maximizing comfort inside the building. This study of load calculation is essential for a building because it helps to pick the best orientation and focuses to find an orientation that will reduce energy due to direct solar radiation. One of the factors affecting this assessment is the latitude of the location. The heat gain is effective through walls and fenestration. Improper management through ineffective orientation of the building's natural heat gain leads to excessive consumption of energy in the form of CL. The total heat gain for the above factors is calculated with the equations and assumptions as per ASHRAE code. After the calculation of heat load for different orientations, the best suited orientation of the building is found. By altering the building to suitable orientation, the dependence on electrical equipment can be minimized and thereby helps in energy conservation. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The conformity of properties of waste glass aggregate with conventional aggregate was found out. Nine cubes (150mm x 150mm x 150mm) were cast out of which three were used for control concrete, three were fully replaced with waste glass as coarse aggregate, three were partially replaced(50%) with waste glass as fine aggregate. Six cylinders (150mm x 300mm) were cast out of which two for control concrete, two cylinders with coarse aggregate fully replaced with waste glass aggregate(WGA) and remaining two cylinders with partially replaced (50%) fine aggregate with waste glass aggregate. Cured specimens were subjected to compression and split-tensile test to ascertain the characteristic compressive strength and split tensile strength. Since the surface of the coarse aggregate plays a significant role in bonding of the rebar in reinforced concrete, pull-out test on both control and Waste Glass Aggregate (WGA) cube specimens (150mm x 150mm with 20mm diameter steel rods) were conducted. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analysis has been done for better understanding of bonding properties in waste glass fine aggregate(WGFA) and waste glass coarse aggregate(WGCA) concrete. Comparison of the results with that of control specimens showed that waste glass could be effectively used as aggregates in reinforced concrete construction. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={In saline, moisture and cold conditions corrosion of steel is inevitable and the lot of economy is used for rehabilitation works. Corrosion of steel is nothing but oxidation of iron in moisture conditions and this corrosion leads to the spalling of concrete which intern reduces the strength of the structure. To reduce this corrosion effects, new materials with resistance against corrosion have to be introduced. Many experiments are going on using Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) as alternate material for steel due to its non-corrosive nature, weight of GFRP is nearly one third of steel and ultimate tensile strength is higher than steel. In this paper, six beams are casted in which three beams are casted with steel as main and shear reinforcement and another three beams are casted with GFRP as main reinforcement with steel as shear reinforcing material. All beams casted are of same dimensions with variation in reinforcement percentage. The size of the beams casted is of length 1200 mm, breadth 100 mm and depth 200 mm. The clear cover of 25 mm is provided on top and bottom of the beam. Beams are tested under two-point loading with constant aspect ratio (a/d) and comparing the flexural strength, load deflection curves and types of failures of beams reinforced with GFRP as main reinforcement and beams reinforced with conventional steel. The final experimental results are compared with numerical results. M30 grade concrete with Conplast as a superplasticizer is used for casting beams. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Proper sizing of the pipe component of water distribution networks play an important role in the overall design of the any water supply system. Several approaches have been applied for the design of networks from an economical point of view. Traditional optimization techniques and population based stochastic algorithms are widely used to optimize the networks. But the use of these approaches is mostly found to be limited to the research level due to difficulties in understanding by the practicing engineers, design engineers and consulting firms. More over due to non-availability of commercial software related to the optimal design of water distribution system,it forces the practicing engineers to adopt either trial and error or experience-based design. This paper presents a simple approach based on power dissipation in each pipeline as a parameter to design the network economically, but not to the level of global minimum cost. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={In the present scenario to fulfill the demands of sustainable construction, concrete made with multi-blended cement system of Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) and different mineral admixtures is the wise choice for the construction industry. In this research work, M20 grade mix of concrete (with water - binder ratio as 0.48) is adopted with glass powder (GP) and Sugar Cane Bagasse Ash (SCBA) as partial replacement of cement. GP is an inert material, they occupy the landfill space for considerable amount of time unless there is a potential for recycling. Such glass wastes in the crushed form have a good potential in the infrastructure industry. Replacement of cement by GP from 30% to 0% by weight of cement in step of 5% and by SCBA from 0% to 30% in step of 5% respectively was adopted. In total, seven different combinations of mixes were studied at two different ages of concrete namely 7 and 28 days. Compressive strength of cubes for various percentage of replacement were investigated and compared with conventional concrete to find out the maximum mix ratio. Flexural strength of concrete for the maximum mix ratio was found out and durability parameters viz., water absorption and sorptivity were studied. From the experimental study, 20% SCBA and 10% GP combination was found to be the maximum mix ratio. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The most common triggering factor of landslides in a hill terrain is rainfall. Assessment of the extreme and antecedent rainfall events and its quantum is imperative to evaluate the temporal occurrence of landslides. It also plays a vital role in the choice of the preventive measures to be adopted. This study focuses on an in-depth rainfall analysis of Coonoor hill station. The analysis includes the study of monthly, seasonal and annual rainfall patterns for a period of 80 years, between 1935 and 2013. Further, one day maximum, 5 day and more antecedent rainfall and its amount is calculated for the years between 2007-2012, 2014 and 2015.The result of the study indicates an increase in the normal rainfall based on the mean of 30 years of data (for the recent decades) and erratic pattern of rainfall during pre-monsoon, post-monsoon south-west monsoon periods. A detailed analysis of daily rainfall for the selected period indicates that extreme highest daily rainfall of more than 300 mm above occurred after consecutive rainfall trigged massive landslides comparing highest rainfall amount around 100 to 180 mm rainfall events. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The conventional concrete when used for structures having dense congested reinforcement, the problems such as external compaction and vibration needs special attention. In such case, the self compacting concrete (SCC) which has the properties like flow ability, passing and filling ability would be an obvious answer. All those SCC flow behavior was governed by EFNARC specifications. In present study, the combination type of SCC was prepared by replacing cement with silica fume (SF) and metakaolin (MK) along with optimum dosages of chemical admixtures. From the fresh property test, cube compressive strength and cylinder split tensile strength, optimum ternary mix was obtained. In order to study the flexural behavior, the optimum ternary mix was taken in which beam specimens of size 1200 mm x 100 mm x 200 mm was designed as singly reinforced section according to IS: 456-2000, Limit state method. Finally the comparative experimental analysis was made between conventional RCC and SCC beams of same grade in terms of flexural strength namely yield load & ultimate load, load- deflection curve, crack size and pattern respectively. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={E-waste disposal has been a significant issue over the past few decades with the development of technology and the plethora of electronic products produced. The inclusive term E-Waste encapsulates various forms of electrical and electronical equipment which provides no value to the current owners and it is one among the fastest growing waste streams. E-Waste is a complex, non-biodegradable waste which is generally dumped in mountain like heaps. These wastes are said to have a large quantities of lead, cadmium, arsenic etc.it is mandatory to dispose such scrupulously since they have the ability to affect the soil and water parameters. Solid waste management is a blooming field which strives to reduce the accumulation of used electronic gadgets. Rainwater gets infiltrated through the e-waste landfill and it leaches through the soil which in turn reaches the groundwater directly thereby affecting the water intended for drinking and domestic purposes. This study focuses on the consequences of toxic waste by comparing the difference in properties of the soil structure prior to and after the e-waste landfill at various concentrations. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The major demand in our country is irrigation demand. Looking to the low irrigation potential and small water resources, it is felt necessary to see that water must be used economically and efficiently. This may be achieved by using latest methods of determination of water requirements for crops and applying the proper water management practices. Evapotranspiration (ET) is a basic for calculation of water requirement for crops. The various popular empirical equations for reference crop evapotranspiration (ETr) belong to three categories namely, Temperature, Radiation based methods and Combined methods. The above methods are site specific; hence it is necessary to recalibrate the coefficients for applying them in India. In the present paper, the standard combined method namely FAO modified Penman method was used to recalibrate the constants in temperature based (TB) methods and it can also be used to determine the ETr for the selected station. Four TB evapotranspiration models namely Blaney-Criddle, Romanenko, Kharrufa, and, Thronthwaite methods are recalibrated and the constant in each method are redefined for the data from Lekkur station, Cuddalore district in India. The result shows that, large error existed when ETr has been calculated with original constants. Hence regression equations were developed to minimise these variations in magnitude. It was found that out of four methods the Blaney-Criddle method suits better for the selected region. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The corrosion of steel reinforcing bars is a predominant factor in limiting the life expectancy of Reinforced Cement Concrete (RCC) structures. Corrosion resistant Fibre Reinforced Polymer (FRP) bars can be an effective alternative to steel bars in this context. Recent investigations reported the flexural behaviour of RCC beams reinforced with Glass Fibre Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) bars. This study is meant to investigate the suitability of Sand Coated GFRP reinforcement bars in short square columns which when loaded axially and loaded with a minimum eccentricity. Standard tests to assess mechanical properties of GFRP bars and pullout test to quantify the bond strength between the bars and concrete were conducted. GFRP reinforced column specimens with a cross-sectional dimension of 100mm X 100mm and of length 1000mm were cast and tested under axial and eccentric loading. The assessed load carrying capacity was compared with that of conventional steel reinforced columns of the same size. The yield load and ultimate load at failure withstood by the steel reinforced columns were considerably more than that of GFRP reinforced columns. The energy absorption capacity of GFRP reinforced columns was also poor compared to steel reinforced columns. Both the columns exhibited nearly the same ductile behaviour. Hence GFRP reinforcements are not recommendable for compression members. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Bridge design requires consideration of the effects produced by temperature variations and the resultant thermal gradients in the structure. Temperature fluctuation leads to expansion and contraction of bridges and these movements are taken care by providing expansion joints and bearings. Free movements of a member can be restrained by imposing certain boundary condition but at the same time considerable allowances should be made for the stresses resulting from this restrained condition since the additional deformations and stresses produced may affect the ultimate and serviceability limit states of the structure. If the reaction force generated by the restraints is very large, then its omission can lead to unsafe design. The principal objective of this research is to study the effects of temperature variation on stresses and deflection in a steel railway bridge. A numerical model, based on finite element analysis is presented for evaluating the thermal performance of the bridge. The selected bridge is analyzed and the temperature field distribution and the corresponding thermal stresses and strains are calculated using the finite element software ABAQUS. A thorough understanding of the thermal load responses of a structure will result in safer and dependable design practices. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Traffic congestion and lack of public pedestrian space are some problems faced by most urban metropolises. Conventionally walking has been a mode of transportation in Indian cities. The percentage of pedestrians may vary from 16 to 57 depending upon the city. Encounters between vehicular traffic and pedestrian traffic are at its rise currently. Rapid industrialization and urbanization in India has resulted in neglecting of pedestrian facilities. Consequently pedestrian are at greater risk for their safety more especially in the commercial zones of large cities. A change in perspective spotlight will create a sense of awareness that the pedestrian traffic is also vital as the vehicular traffic. Soothing the traffic would moderately cut the driving expediency but the pedestrians will get a much safer and peaceful route to their terminuses. Safety and comfort are the two pans of a balance while considering the pedestrian traffic. Considering these aspects, this study deals a study in improving pedestrian facilities by analysing the existing skeleton of the selected locations. The adequacy of facility is checked based on IRC latest guidelines and counteractive measures are postulated. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={In the current situation, to overcome the difficulties of feasible construction, concrete made with various mixtures of Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) and diverse mineral admixtures, is the wise choice for engineering construction. Mineral admixtures viz. Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBS), Meta kaolin (MK), Fly Ash (FA) and Silica Fume (SF) etc. are used as Supplementary Cementitious Materials (SCM) in binary and ternary blend cement system to enhance the mechanical and durability properties. Investigation on the effect of different replacement levels of OPC in M25 grade with FA + SF in ternary cement blend on the strength characteristics and beam behavior was studied. The OPC was partially replaced (by weight) with different combinations of SF (5%, 10%, 15%, 20% and 25%) and FA as 50% (High Volume Fly Ash - HVFA). The amount of FA addition is kept constant at 50% for all combinations. The compressive strength and tensile strength tests on cube and cylinder specimens, at 7 and 28 days were carried out. Based on the compressive strength results, optimum mix proportion was found out and flexural behaviour was studied for the optimum mix. It was found that all the mixes (FA + SF) showed improvement in compressive strength over that of the control mix and the mix with 50% FA + 10% SF has 20% increase over the control mix. The tensile strength was also increased over the control mix. Flexural behaviour also showed a significant improvement in the mix with FA and SF over the control mix. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The practical need of self-compacting concrete (SCC) is increasing due to increase in the infrastructure competence all over the world. The effective way of increasing the strength of concrete and enhance the behaviour under extreme loading (fire) is the keen interest. Glass fibers were added for five different of volume fractions (0%, 0.1%, 0.3%, 0.5% and 0.6%) to determine the optimum percentage of glass fiber without compensating the fresh properties and enhanced hardened properties of SCC concrete. The fresh state of concrete is characterized by slump flow, T-50cm slump flow, and V-funnel and L- box tests. The results obtained in fresh state are compared with the acceptance criteria of EFNARC specification. Concrete specimens were casted to evaluate the hardened properties such as compressive strength, split tensile strength, flexural strength and modulus of elasticity. Incorporation the glass fiber into SCC reduces the workability but within the standard specification. The hardened properties of SCC glass fiber reinforced concrete were enhanced, due to bridging the pre-existing micro cracks in concrete by glass fiber addition. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The emergence and spread of pathogens harboring extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) like carbapenem resistant Gram negative bacteria are the major emerging threat to public health. Of particular concern Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenamase- producing strains have been recorded worldwide. Catheter associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) caused by K. pneumoniae are significantly associated with morbidity and mortality. Hence the present work was aimed to develop a strategy for addressing these issues through an innovative approach of antibiofilm and immunomodulation. These two independent activities were analyzed in a Streptomyces derived ASK2 bioactive compound. While analysing the effect of sub-minimum inhibitory concentrations (sub-MICs), 0.5x of Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) was found to be more effective in preventing biofilm formation on coverslip and silicone catheter. The minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) was found to be 15-fold higher MIC with eradication of 75% of 3 day old biofilm. Apart from its antibiofilm potential, ASK2 also acts as an opsonin and enhances phagocytic response of macrophages against multidrug resistant K. pneumoniae. In addition, ASK2 resulted in elevated levels of nitric oxide generation by the macrophages and has a stimulating effect on IL-12, IFN-γ, and TNF-α proinflammatory cytokines. The opsonic role of ASK2 and its potential in modulating proinflammatory cytokines secreted by macrophages implies the importance of ASK2 in modulating cellular immune response of macrophages against MDR K. pneumoniae. The present study proposes ASK2 as a promising candidate for treating MDR K. pneumoniae infections with its dual properties of antibiofilm and immunomodulatory activities. © 2017 Lalitha, Raman, Rathore, Ramar,Munusamy and Ramakrishnan.},

abstract={Consumption of fruits leads to increase in glucose level in blood for diabetic patients, which in turn leads to peripheral, vascular, ocular complications and cardiac diseases. In this context, a non-enzymatic hybrid glucose biosensor was fabricated for the first time to detect glucose by immobilizing titanium oxide–manganese oxide (TiO2–Mn3O4) nanocomposite and chitosan membrane on to the surface of Pt working electrode (Pt/TiO2–Mn3O4/chitosan). TiO2–Mn3O4 nanocomposite catalyzed the oxidation of glucose to gluconolactone in the absence of glucose oxidase enzyme with high electron transfer rate, good biocompatibility and large surface coverage. Electrochemical measurements revealed the excellent sensing response of the developed biosensor towards glucose with a high sensitivity of 7.073 µA mM−1, linearity of 0.01–0.1 mM, low detection limit of 0.01 µM, reproducibility of 1.5% and stability of 98.8%. The electrochemical parameters estimated from the anodic process were subjected to linear regression models for the detection of unknown concentration of glucose in different fruit samples. © 2017, The Author(s).},

abstract={In this paper, the heat transfer to the fluid, passing through the double forward facing step (FFS) channel with square obstacle is enhanced by Taguchi's S/N ratio analysis. Flow through the forward facing step channel has a wide range of applications in thermal systems due to its flow separation and subsequent reattachment, which in turn enhances the heat transfer. Flow separation and reattachment mainly depends on the channel geometry, obstacle and flow parameters. Hence, in this study, step height in the channel, obstacle size, Reynold's number and gap between the obstacle and step are included as control paramters in the S/N ratio analysis for maximizing the heat transfer. These parameters are varied through three levels of values and L9 orthogonal array is employed. Numerical simulation technique is applied to analyze the L9 cases through computational fluid dynamics code. From the simulation, the rise in temperature at the channel exit with reference to the inlet is predicted. The best values for the identified control parameters conclude to a temperature raise of about 2.86°C. The optimum result obtained from the S/N ratio analysis is also compared with response surface methodology technique. Finally, analysis of variance (ANOVA) is conducted and identified that step height and flow Reynold's number affect the heat transfer by about 79 and 19%, respectively.},

abstract={Objective: The main objective of the research work was to optimize the water requirement/content used in kneading method for solid dispersion/inclusion complex formation between water insoluble drug and polymer. Methods: Nimesulide (model drug) and β-cyclodextrin were taken in a different ratio such as 1:1, 1:3 and 1:5 and, the mixture was triturated well for half hour. Water was incorporated to the mixture in different levels like 75%, 50%, 25% w/v in divided proportions and 0% (no water addition, but the mixture was triturated continuously). After each part of water addition, the mixture was triturated well for 10 min and dried using hot air over for 30 min at 50 °C and sieved using sieve no: 44. The complexes formed were subjected for various analytical characterization studies including solubility, particle size, the angle of repose, tapped density, Carr’s index, fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR), thermo gravimetric-differential thermal analysis (TG-TDA), x-ray diffraction (XRD) studies and in vitro dissolution studies. Results: The dissolution studies showed improvement in the release of nimesulide, which depended on the percentage level of water. The solubility of the sample was increased with increasing the concentration of the inclusion complex formed. Kneading method was proved to be a successful technique for formation of stable inclusion complex of nimesulide with β-cyclodextrin. All the formulations exhibited acceptable particle size and solubility in the range of 22.6±2 to 29±5 and 45±5 to 133±3.5 respectively. Conclusion: Nimesulide and β-cyclodextrin complex was successfully prepared and characterized for the drug-polymer stability and interactions. The result confirmed that the liquid content in the solid dispersion prepared by the kneading method played an important role in the dissolution of the poorly soluble drug. © 2017 The Authors.},

abstract={A switched mode power supply for Manual Metal Arc Welding (MMAW) is proposed in this paper. This is done as a comparative study, using two different converters at the front end - namely, Zeta converter and Canonical Switching Cell converter. Both the converters operate in discontinuous inductor current mode (DICM) to accomplish inherent Power Factor Correction (PFC). This mode of operation reduces the intricacy of control and provides considerable dc-voltage regulation. A pulse width modulated (PWM) isolated full bridge dc-dc converter is used at the load side, for both the designs to provide high frequency isolation. A closed loop control is being envisaged to incorporate dc voltage regulation at the output and to provide over current protection, so that the designs are suitable for the intended application. The designs have been simulated and the results obtained show how these two designs satisfy the requirement of the power supply for arc welding process. The performance of the two power supplies have been evaluated on the basis of power supply current, dynamic characteristics, power factor and voltage regulation. © 2006-2017 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).},

abstract={Conventional energy sources are not preferred, rather, wind energy is mainly used which is a renewable source of energy and is unlimited in nature. Wind turbines are of two types-variable speed wind turbine and fixed speed wind turbine. At distinct wind speeds, wind turbine has to run at variable rotor speed to obtain the maximum power. Power converters can be used to accomplish the maximum power. DFIG is one among variable speed wind turbine and is mainly considered, due to its high energy output, damping performance, low- converter rating and low cost. Another renewable source of energy which is nothing but solar energy is incorporated by applying Synchronous reference frame algorithm. For improving power quality and to obtain maximum power wind energy conversion system (WECS) is provided with doubly fed induction generator (DFIG). The role of rotor side converter (RSC) is to distribute reactive power to DFIG whereas grid side converter (GSC) is used to get even DC voltage and reduce harmonics which is due to non-linear load. WECS acts like DFIG to reduce deviations and distortions of voltage and current from sinusoidal waveform even when the wind turbine is at halt. In case of solar system, for reactive power compensation and to get three phase active power the SPV system is linked to VSC. For extracting maximum power and to increase the efficiency from the SPV array, a singlestage three phase grid system is used along MPPT technique which is integrated with the synchronous reference frame algorithm. Both the sources are compared and the best system out of the two systems has been obtained using MATLAB simulation. © 2006-2017 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).},

abstract={Multi-level inverter technology is used to obtain a high output power from medium voltage sources like batteries and solar panel. Reduced harmonic distortion in the output voltage and lower EMI (Electro Magnetic Interference) are the main advantages of multi-level inverter. However, there are some disadvantages such as increased number of components as level is increased, complicated PWM control method and voltage balancing problem at neutral point. Reversing voltage topology overcomes the disadvantages of the conventional multi-level inverter. The new topology uses reduced quantity of total switches at higher levels which leads to the reduction in switching losses, lesser carrier signals for PWM control, improves power quality and reduces the harmonics at the output voltage. The new converter topology is implemented for 5-level and 9-level using Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation (SPWM) techniques. Phase disposition SPWM, Phase opposition disposition SPWM, Alternate phase opposition disposition SPWM and Variable frequency SPWM techniques are applied to generate the gate pulses for the switches in the 9-level inverter and the THD (%) is compared.

abstract={Cement acts as the most important component of concrete as it binds and holds the concrete together. But it is one of the major CO2 emitters all over the world, during manufacturing (900 kg of CO2 per 1000 kg). Some of the modern construction methods aim at reducing the amount of usage of cement and came out with numerous solutions for replacement of the same. One such supplement in current trend is the Steel dust or the Electric Arc Furnace Dust (EAFD), which is a waste product from the electric arc furnace when the scrap metal is melted. When the concrete containing steel dust is exposed to atmosphere, the environmental oxygen and moisture play role to form rust and ultimately the member becomes harder. As Cement is the binder of conventional concrete, only certain percentage of the same could be replaced by the new material, steel dust. Tests were conducted for the 28 days cube strength of M45 grade (suitable for prestressing) concrete which has 0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% and 50% steel dust instead cement. From the test, the optimum percentage replacement of steel dust was obtained, for which the beams and overhead poles were cast, prestressed and tested for the failure load and deflections. A conventional concrete beam and overhead pole were also cast, prestressed and tested to compare the results with those of the beam and pole that contained steel dust. The load vs. deflection plot and other results from the test is also discussed. © 2017 Techno-Press, Ltd.},

In this work, we identify the rate determining step for selenium, particularly Se (VI) reduction on Ni-Fe BNPs using kinetic data modeling. A non-stationary kinetic model, without any preliminary assumptions of a rate limiting step was developed. The kinetic data on Se (VI) reduction was fitted to the non-stationary to determine the rate constants. The non-stationary model suggested adsorption limiting step for Se (VI) reduction on Ni-Fe BNPs. With increase in BNP loading (i.e., increase in number of active surface sites), reaction rates also increased linearly. Deviation from linearity was observed due to the deactivation of the BNPs. The loss in catalytic activity can be attributed to the formation of metal oxide on the catalyst particle, resulting in loss of active sites. Even though selenium reduction may no longer occur on the newly formed metal oxides, selenium removal via adsorption can occur. Prediction of the occupied site concentration on the Ni-Fe BNPs suggested possible in-situ regeneration of the active site due to galvanic coupling of the bimetals. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={The electronic and NO2 adsorption properties of hydrogenated armchair phosphorene nanosheet device is investigated through density functional theory (DFT) and non-equilibrium Green's function method (NEGF). The armchair phosphorene nanosheet is used for the detection of NO2 gas in phosphorene molecular device. The DOS spectrum demonstrates the change in peak maxima due to transfer of electrons between NO2 gas and phosphorene base material. The change in the peak amplitude is observed along the valance band as well as in the conduction band in the transmission spectrum of phosphorene device. I–V characteristics support the change in the current upon adsorption of NO2 gas molecule on phosphorene molecular device. Using formation energy, structural stability of phosphorene nanosheet has been studied. The adsorption properties of NO2 on phosphorene nanosheet have also been investigated with the help of adsorption energy, Mulliken charge and Bader charge analysis. In order to ascertain the selectivity of NO2 gas along phosphorene molecular device in the ambient condition, the adsorption behavior of O2 and CO2 is also studied. The findings of the present work confirm that phosphorene molecular device can be used as a NO2 gas sensor and also the influence of Al substitution in phosphorene nanosheet device is explored and reported. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Myocardial reperfusion injury is a consequence of restoration of blood flow post ischemia. It is a complex process involving an acute inflammatory response activated by cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and mediated by free radicals, calcium overload leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. Secretory phospholipases (sPLA2) are a group of pro-inflammatory molecules associated with diseases such as atherosclerosis, which increase the risk of reperfusion injury. This acute response leads to breakdown of phospholipids such as cardiolipin, found in the mitochondrial inner membrane, leading to disruption of energy producing enzymes of the electron transport chain. Thus the activation of secretory phospholipases has a direct link to the vascular occlusion and arrhythmia observed in myocardial reperfusion injury. Therapeutic agents targeting sPLA2 are under human trials and many are in the preclinical phase. This article reviews the pathological effects of various groups of secretory phospholipases (I, II, V and X) implicated in myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury and the phospholipase inhibitors under development. Considering the fact that human trials in this class of drugs is limited, sPLA2 as a potential target for drug development is emphasized. © 2017},

The electronic and structural stability of borospherene is confirmed in terms of density of states spectrum and formation energy. The adsorption behavior is explored using adsorption energy, energy gap, charge transfer and average energy gap variation. The change in the projected density of states and charge transfer between CO and NO molecules and borospherene is observed upon adsorption of gas molecules. Moreover, the adsorption of NO molecules is found be to be more favorable rather than CO on borospherene. The adsorption site of CO and NO on borospherene is analyzed in atomistic level.

abstract={Over the past few decades, the design of an intelligent Intrusion Detection System (IDS) remains an open challenge to the research community. Continuous efforts by the researchers have resulted in the development of several learning models based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to improve the performance of the IDSs. However, there exists a tradeoff with respect to the stability of ANN architecture and the detection rate for less frequent attacks. This paper presents a novel approach based on Helly property of Hypergraph and Arithmetic Residue-based Probabilistic Neural Network (HG AR-PNN) to address the classification problem in IDS. The Helly property of Hypergraph was exploited for the identification of the optimal feature subset and the arithmetic residue of the optimal feature subset was used to train the PNN. The performance of HG AR-PNN was evaluated using KDD CUP 1999 intrusion dataset. Experimental results prove the dominance of HG AR-PNN classifier over the existing classifiers with respect to the stability and improved detection rate for less frequent attacks. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

Due to increased competition on river water sharing over the past century, availability and reliability of water in this region is dwindling. Changes in management practices, which caused the deterioration of traditional tank (relatively small reservoir) irrigation systems, and the difficulties in reviving them are discussed. Increasing the storage capacity of irrigation tanks for augmenting water availability for irrigation is discussed in detail. Managing the huge cost involved in deepening the heavily silted tanks in a sustainable manner is suggested through allowing mining activities in the tanks.

In addition, the study tries to identify their familiarity with mHealth and their willingness to use their mobile devices in health -related functions. The duration of this study was between the months of February-march of 2017. For this study, the data was collected from various respondents using a well-structured questionnaire. Those who were using mHealth application in various cities across Tamilnadu were included for this study. Judgment sampling method is adopted and 40 respondents were included for this study. The collected data was analyzed by using frequency analysis, factor analysis, chi square analysis and Regression analysis with the help of SPSS package. The result revealed that the consumer perception has a positive impact on the attributes that build confidence in using mHealth applications. It has been found that the factors like relevance, rating and popularity plays a very important role in influencing the consumer to download the mHealth applications. The study found that there is an association between the skincare app category and gender i.e. more skincare apps are downloaded by the female respondents and also it found that other remaining categories of mHealth applications don’t have any association with the gender. Risk of privacy and inaccurate information, app dependency, are some of the factors which cause fear in the respondents’ mind and it resist them from downloading such apps. © RJPT All right reserved.},

abstract={The 26th December 2004 tsunami inundation had caused severe damages all along the east coast of Tamil Nadu. The features like near shore topography, geomorphology and land use dictate the extent of inundation while the post tsunami field survey shows that the extent of inundation and its resultant damage is not uniform. Further, significant variations were also noticed even within the same landform feature having similar topographic gradient indicating that the inundation is not solely controlled by an individual factor. To unveil the interrelationship between the above features and inundation, the 140-km coastal stretch of Tamil Nadu from Porto Nova in the north to Kodiyakkarai in the south was studied. The post tsunami ENVISAT satellite image was used for mapping the inundation while the controlling parameters namely the geomorphology and the land use / land cover were mapped using IRSP6 satellite images and subsequently integrated using ArcGIS 9.3 software. To precisely deduce the causative factor, a piecewise correlation was done by laterally dividing the study area into 14 segments of 10 km each. Consequently, by integrating it with the above layers, the aerial extent of inundation and the integrated geomorphology and land use / land cover features in each segment was calculated. Then using the terrastat statistical software, factor varimax analysis was carried out between them and based on the derived factor scores, the role of the integrated features over the inundation was deduced. Consequently, mitigation strategies were suggested.},

abstract={This article investigates the price discovery and volatility transmission between currency spot and futures markets in India. Daily closing currency spot and futures prices of United States dollar/Indian Rupee (USD/INR), Japanese Yen/Indian Rupee (JPY/INR), Great Britain Pound/Indian Rupee (GBP/INR) and Euro/Indian Rupee (EUR/INR) from 1 March 2010 to 20 January 2015 were used. Both long-and short-run relationship as well as volatility transmission was investigated by the use of Engle Granger co-integration test, error correction mechanism, causality test and the bivariate GARCH model. The co-integration results proved that there is a long-run relationship between currency spot and futures prices. The study finds that there is a unidirectional causal relationship from currency spot to futures prices of JPY/INR, GBP/INR and EUR/INR. Further, results conclude the bidirectional causal relationship between USD/INR currency spot and futures prices. The result further shows that the spot market adjusts to new information faster than futures market suggesting that spot price leads the futures price and contributes largely to price discovery. Finally, the results show that there is unidirectional volatility transmission from currency spot to futures prices of JPY/INR, GBP/INR and EUR/INR and bidirectional spillover between currency spot and futures prices of USD/INR. Based on the findings, relevant policy recommendations are made. © 2017, International Management Institute, New Delhi.},

abstract={A vertex v of a graph G = (V,E) is said to ve-dominate every edge incident to v, as well as every edge adjacent to these incident edges. A set S ⊆ V is a vertex-edge dominating set (double vertex-edge dominating set, respectively) if every edge of E is ve-dominated by at least one vertex (at least two vertices) of S. The minimum cardinality of a vertex-edge dominating set (double vertex-edge dominating set, respectively) of G is the vertex-edge domination number γve(G) (the double vertex-edge domination number γdve(G), respectively). In this paper, we initiate the study of double vertex-edge domination. We first show that determining the number γdve(G) for bipartite graphs is NP-complete. We also prove that for every nontrivial connected graphs G, γdve(G) ≥ γve(G) + 1, and we characterize the trees T with γdve(T) = γve(T) + 1 or γdve(T) = γve(T) + 2. Finally, we provide two lower bounds on the double ve-domination number of trees and unicycle graphs in terms of the order n, the number of leaves and support vertices, and we characterize the trees attaining the lower bound. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={It is highly desirable to increase the accuracy of automatic weld defect detection in X-radiography for non-destructive testing and evaluation. For this purpose, a machine vision method is proposed for weld defect segmentation, using the Least Probability Weighted Background Group (LPWBG), an improved version of Otsu's method. This automatically selects a desired threshold value for segmenting the weld defects by adapting the Weibull distribution. The least non-zero probability value of gray-levels of the whole image has been considered as a weighted parameter of the background group of Otsu's within-class criterion. It has been determined that the resulting threshold value will always lie at the left bottom side of the unimodal distribution, especially when the defects are smaller than the background area. Existing approaches such as Otsu's threshold, valley-emphasis, neighborhood valley-emphasis, and weighted object variance have similarly been tried and compared with the proposed method. Our results establish that the proposed method provides satisfactory segmentation results over the others. The performance of the LPWBG method has been both evaluated and compared, using Misclassification Error measure (ME) with significant results. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH},

abstract={Quercetin is a bioactive compound with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anticancer properties. This study exemplifies the differential cytotoxic activity of Quercetin on two human colonic cancer cell lines, HT29 and HCT15. IC50 of Quercetin for HT29 and HCT15 cells were 42.5 μM and 77.4 μM, respectively. Activation of caspase-3, increased level of cytosolic cytochrome c, decreased levels of pAkt, pGSK-3β and cyclin D1 in 40 μM Quercetin treated HT29 cells alone. Though, nuclear translocation of NFkB was increased in 40 μM Quercetin treated HT29 and HCT15 cells, over expression of COX-2 was observed in 40 μM Quercetin treated HT29 cells, whereas, Quercetin treated HCT15 cells did not expressed COX-2. Increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was observed only in Quercetin treated HT29 cells, which is due to over expression of COX-2, as COX-2 silencing inhibited Quercetin induced apoptosis and ROS generation. Insilico analysis provided evidence that Quercetin could partially inhibit COX-2 enzyme by binding to subunit A which has peroxidase activity and serves as source of ROS. However, Quercetin showed minimal effect on normal intestinal epithelial cells i,e IEC-6. To conclude, differential sensitivity of two cancer cells, HT29 and HCT15, to Quercetin depends on COX-2 dependent ROS generation that induces apoptosis and inhibits cell survival. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

X-ray diffraction patterns and Fourier transform infrared spectra confirmed the formation of pure ZnO and PANI–ZnO composites. Field emission scanning electron micrographs revealed the leaf like structure of ZnO, porous nature of PANI and the uniformly distributed blend of these two structures for the composite films.

NIR spectrometer and Vibrating sample magnetometer before and after doping. The thin films exhibit hexagonal wurtizite structure with (0 0 2) preferential orientation and the calculated crystallite size is 29 and 18 nm for pristine and Co-doped CdS films respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis showed the presence of Cd, S and Co peaks along with O 1s peak. The studies revealed that the surface Cd atoms of films are found to be bound either to S atoms or O atoms. SEM images showed grainy surface for pristine which gets modified under Co doping. Energy dispersive analysis using X-rays confirmed the presence of Cd, S and Co in the films. From optical transmittance spectra, the bandgap was estimated and found to be varying from 2.4 to 2.27 eV with the increase of Co concentrations.

abstract={Carbonic anhydrase IX is a tumor-associated membrane-bound metallo-enzyme which catalyzes the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide (CO2) to bicarbonate (HCO3 −) and proton (H+) ions. It is a hypoxia-inducible enzyme and plays a critical role in tumor pH homeostasis favoring tumor cell invasiveness and drug resistance. Over expression of CAIX is documented in cancers of breast, lung, kidney, colon/rectum, etc. Chemical inhibition of CAIX activity has proven to be an effective therapeutic modality towards targeting cancer. Hence, in this study, we intend to identify potential molecules from NCI (National Cancer Institute) and Maybridge databases implementing high-throughput virtual screening. CAIX co-crystallized with acetazolamide (a known inhibitor of CAIX) (PDB ID: 3IAI) was used for reference-guided docking protocol. The potential inhibitors among the coupled data sets were finalized based on Glide docking score, Prime/MMGBSA scoring, significant intermolecular interactions, ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion, toxicity) prediction and stability of complex formation, molecular dynamics simulation, and comparative analysis. By this study, we propose NSC_93618, NSC_170253, NSC_93618, JFD03677, SEW06488, and BTB09372 to be highly significant, as all these compounds were found to qualify as potential leads surpassing all the stringent filtering process. However, NSC_93618 was found to be the most potential, as it featured with higher complex stability with strong bonded interactions, binding affinity synonymous to acetazolamide. Hence, these proposed compounds shall prove to be effective in targeting CAIX towards modulating carcinogenesis. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Ethyl acetate extract of the plant was eluted and pooled into 6 fractions based on their Rf values and the fractions were tested for cytotoxicity. Fraction 3 was found effective (IC50 = 28.5 µL/mL) and was subjected to LC-MS analysis which indicated the presence of biochanin, eleutherol and cinnamic acid. Further, cytotoxic effect of the fraction was confirmed in terms of nucleolin, bcl2, bax and cytochrome c expression in MCF-7 cells through RT-PCR where a marked decrease in nucleolin, bcl2 and increase in bax and cytochrome c were observed. The presence of eleutherol, a well-known anti-oxidant and anti-cancer agent, has been reported for the first time in O. stamineus. The anti-cancer activity of O. stamineus may be due to the presence of elutherol and cinnamic acid. © 2017, Bangladesh Pharmacological Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This paper proposes a Magneto Rheological linear clutch for use in human safe robotic applications. The force transmitted to the links of the robot must be precisely controlled for any manipulator if it has to be operated safely alongside humans. The traditional approaches to this problem is using various compliant actuating schemes like Series Elastic Actuators, Joint Torque Control etc. Research on the usage of smart materials that change their properties on application of electrical or magnetic fields for human safe robots have gained momentum recently. Studies on the feasibility of Magneto-Rheological actuators has been done already. This paper introduces a MR clutch which can control the force transmitted by a linear actuator. The electromechanical model of the linear clutch has been developed, implemented in hardware, and tested using a prototype one Degree of Freedom arm. The design of the clutch is detailed and the performance is characterized thorough a series of experiments. The results suggest that the linear clutch serves well for the precise force control of a linear actuator. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Galerkin meshfree schemes are emerging as a viable substitute to finite element method to solve partial differential equations for the large deformations as well as crack propagation problems. However, the introduction of Shanon-Jayne's entropy principle in to the scattered data approximation has deviated from the trend of defining the approximation functions, resulting in maximum entropy approximants. Further in addition to this, an objective functional which controls the degree of locality resulted in Local maximum entropy approximants. These are based on information-theoretical Pareto optimality between entropy and degree of locality that are defining the basis functions to the scattered nodes. The degree of locality in turn relies on the choice of locality parameter and prior (weight) function. The proper choices of both plays vital role in attain the desired accuracy. Present work is focused on the choice of locality parameter which defines the degree of locality and priors: Gaussian, Cubic spline and quartic spline functions on the behavior of local maximum entropy approximants. © 2017 Author(s).},

abstract={The efficiency of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) in the N-heterocyclic carbene-catalyzed Mannich reaction for the synthesis of β-amino ketones has been demonstrated. This strategy involves oxidative coupling of aryl methyl ketones and 2-aminopyridines in the presence of DMF. The reaction does not require pre-functionalization of the substrates, thus making it a practically applicable approach for the generation of β-amino ketones. The reaction requires the use of tin(II) chloride dihydrate (SnCl2⋅2 H2O) as Lewis acid in the presence of tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) as the oxidant.

abstract={Electroencephalogram (EEG) is the recording of the electrical activity of the brain which can be used to identify different disease conditions. In the case of a partial epilepsy, some portions of the brain is affected and the EEG measured from that portions are called as Focal EEG and the EEG measured from other regions is termed as Non Focal EEG. The identification of Focal EEG assists the doctors in finding the epileptogenic focus and thereby go for surgical removal of those portions of the brain for those who are having drug resistant epilepsy. In this work, we have proposed a classification methodology to classify Focal and Non Focal EEG. We used the Bern Barcelona database and used entropies such as Approximate entropy (ApEn), Sample entropy (SampEn) and Reyni's entropy as features. These features were fed into six different classifiers such as Naïve Bayes (NBC), Radial Basis function (RBF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), KNN classifier, Non-Nested Generalized Exemplars classifier (NNge) and Best First Decision Tree (BFDT) classifier. It was found that NNge classifier gave the highest accuracy of 98%, sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 96%, which is the highest comparing to other methods in the literature. In addition to the above, the maximum computation time of our features is 0.054 seconds which opens the window for real time processing. Thus our method can be written as a handy software tool towards assisting the physician. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The ionospheric electron density peak (NmF2) is analyzed for the recent minima of solar activity for two mid-latitude stations, Rome (41.8°N, 12.5°E, geomagnetic latitude 41.7°N, Italy) and Gibilmanna (37.9°N, 14.0°E, geomagnetic latitude 37.6°N, Italy), and for the low-latitude station of Tucumán (26.9°S, 294.6°E, geomagnetic latitude 17.2°S, Argentina), located in the south ridge of the equatorial ionization anomaly. An inter-minima comparison reveals that from an ionospheric point of view the last minimum of solar activity (minimum 23/24) was peculiar, with values of NmF2 lower than those recorded during the previous minima for all the stations and all the hours of the day. A more pronounced decrease is observed at Tucumán than at Rome and Gibilmanna. The study of the winter and semi-annual anomaly shows that at mid-latitude stations the winter anomaly is not visible only for the years 2008 and 2009, which represent the deeper part of the prolonged and anomalous last solar minimum. The same is for the semi-annual anomaly. A comparison with the version 2012 of the International Reference Ionosphere model (IRI) is also carried out. The results reveal that for low solar activity the model works better at mid latitudes than at low latitudes, confirming the problems of IRI in correctly representing the low-latitude ionosphere. Nevertheless, using as input updated values of the solar and geomagnetic indices, no loss of accuracy is detected in the IRI performances for the last solar minimum with respect to the previous ones, both at mid and low latitudes. © 2016 COSPAR},

abstract={Dental caries occurs as a result of dysbiosis among commensal and pathogenic bacteria leading to demineralization of enamel within a dental biofilm(plaque) as a consequence of lower pH in the oral cavity. In our previous study, we have reported 1,3-disubstituted ureas particularly, 1,3-di-m-tolylurea(DMTU) could inhibit the biofilm formation along with lower concentrations of fluoride (31.25 ppm) without affecting bacterial growth. In the present study, RT-qPCR analysis showed the target specific molecular mechanism of DMTU. In vivo treatment with DMTU, alone or in combination with fluoride, resulted in inhibition of caries(biofilm development of Streptococcus mutans) using a Wistar rat model for dental caries. The histopathological analysis reported the development of lesions on dentine in infected subjects whereas the dentines of treated rodents were found to be intact and healthy. Reduction in inflammatory markers in rodents' blood and liver samples was observed when treated with DMTU. Collectively, data speculate that DMTU is an effective anti-biofilm and anti-inflammatory agent, which may improve the cariostatic properties of fluoride.},

abstract={Staphylococcus aureus is a widely acknowledged Gram-positive pathogen for forming biofilm and virulence gene expressions by quorum sensing (QS), a cell to cell communication process. The quorum regulator SarA of S. aureus up-regulates the expression of many virulence factors including biofilm formation to mediate pathogenesis and evasion of the host immune system in the late phases of growth. Thus, inhibiting the production or blocking SarA protein might influence the down-regulation of biofilm and virulence factors. In this context, here we have synthesized 2-[(Methylamino)methyl]phenol, which was specifically targeted toward the quorum regulator SarA through in silico approach in our previous study. The molecule has been evaluated in vitro to validate its antibiofilm activity against clinical S. aureus strains. In addition, antivirulence properties of the inhibitor were confirmed with the observation of a significant reduction in the expression of representative virulence genes like fnbA, hla and hld that are governed under S. aureus QS. Interestingly, the SarA targeted inhibitor showed negligible antimicrobial activity and markedly reduced the minimum inhibitory concentration of conventional antibiotics when used in combination making it a more attractive lead for further clinical tests. © 2017 Balamurugan, Praveen Krishna, Bharath, Lavanya, Vairaprakash and Adline Princy.},

The band structure and density of spectrum gives the insights on the adsorption properties of ethanol and n-butanol on Co3O4 base material. The change in the energy gap and variation in the charge density is observed upon adsorption of ethanol and n-butanol on p-type Co3O4 base material. The findings show that the adsorption property of n-butanol is more favorable on Co3O4 nanostructures. The prominent adsorption sites of ethanol and n-butanol on Co3O4 nanostructures are identified in atomistic level. From the results, it is clearly evident that Co3O4 nanostructures can be efficiently used as sensing element for the detection of ethanol and n-butanol vapors in the atmosphere. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

Increase in the usage of standalone photovoltaic (SAPV) systems forces the better and even deeper understanding of factors that influence the performance of SAPV systems for better efficiency. Many researchers have analyzed the PV module in terms of panel modelling and I-V characteristics but in this works aspects that involve external conditions are not taken into consideration.This paper analyses performance consideration and factors that affect the performance of the SAPV such as effect of dust and shadowing.

abstract={Mammographic density is considered a major risk factor for developing breast cancer. This paper proposes an automated approach to classify breast tissue types in digital mammogram. The main objective of the proposed Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system is to investigate various feature extraction methods and classifiers to improve the diagnostic accuracy in mammogram density classification. Texture analysis methods are used to extract the features from the mammogram. Texture features are extracted by using histogram, Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM), Gray Level Run Length Matrix (GLRLM), Gray Level Difference Matrix (GLDM), Local Binary Pattern (LBP), Entropy, Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT), Gabor transform and trace transform. These extracted features are selected using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). The features selected by ANOVA are fed into the classifiers to characterize the mammogram into two-class (fatty/dense) and three-class (fatty/glandular/dense) breast density classification. This work has been carried out by using the mini-Mammographic Image Analysis Society (MIAS) database. Five classifiers are employed namely, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Naive Bayes (NB), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Experimental results show that ANN provides better performance than LDA, NB, KNN and SVM classifiers. The proposed methodology has achieved 97.5% accuracy for three-class and 99.37% for two-class density classification. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd and Sissa Medialab.},

abstract={Light sensing has independently evolved multiple times under diverse selective pressures but has been examined only in a handful among the millions of light-responsive organisms. Unsurprisingly, mechanistic insights into how differential light processing can cause distinct behavioral outputs are limited. We show how an organism can achieve complex light processing with a simple “eye” while also having independent but mutually interacting light sensing networks. Although planarian flatworms lack wavelength-specific eye photoreceptors, a 25 nm change in light wavelength is sufficient to completely switch their phototactic behavior. Quantitative photoassays, eye-brain confocal imaging, and RNA interference/knockdown studies reveal that flatworms are able to compare small differences in the amounts of light absorbed at the eyes through a single eye opsin and convert them into binary behavioral outputs. Because planarians can fully regenerate, eye-brain injury-regeneration studies showed that this acute light intensity sensing and processing are layered on simple light detection. Unlike intact worms, partially regenerated animals with eyes can sense light but cannot sense finer gradients. Planarians also show a “reflex-like,” eye-independent (extraocular/whole-body) response to low ultraviolet A light, apart from the “processive” eye-brain–mediated (ocular) response. Competition experiments between ocular and extraocular sensory systems reveal dynamic interchanging hierarchies. In intact worms, cerebral ocular response can override the reflex-like extraocular response. However, injury-regeneration again offers a time window wherein both responses coexist, but the dominance of the ocular response is reversed. Overall, we demonstrate acute light intensity–based behavioral switching and two evolutionarily distinct but interacting light sensing networks in a regenerating organism.

abstract={Viper venom hyaluronidase (VV-HYA) inhibitors have long been used as therapeutic agents for arresting the local and systemic effects caused during its envenomation. Henceforth, to understand its structural features and also to identify the best potential inhibitor against it the present computational study was undertaken. Structure-based homology modeling of VV-HYA followed by its docking and free energy-based ranking analysis of ligand, the MD simulations of the lead complex was also performed. The sequence analysis and homology modeling of VV-HYA revealed a distorted (β/α)8 folding as in the case of hydrolases family of proteins. Molecular docking of the resultant 3D structure of VV-HYA with known inhibitors (compounds 1–25) revealed the importance of molecular recognition of hotspot residues (Tyr 75, Arg 288, and Trp 321) other than that of the active site residues. It also revealed that Trp 321 of VV-HYA is highly important for mediating π–π interactions with ligands. In addition, the molecular docking and comparative free energy binding analysis was investigated for the VV-HYA inhibitors (compounds 1–25). Both molecular docking and relative free energy binding analysis clearly confirmed the identification of sodium chromoglycate (compound 1) as the best potential inhibitor against VV-HYA. Molecular dynamics simulations additionally confirmed the stability of their binding interactions. Further, the information obtained from this work is believed to serve as an impetus for future rational designing of new novel VV-HYA inhibitors with improved activity and selectivity. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Selection of geometrical and machining parameters has great influence in machining performance. Predictive modeling can be used in optimization and control of process parameters. This study focuses on the optimization and sensitivity analysis of machining parameters, and fine-tuning requirements to obtain better machining performance. A statistical prediction model was developed in terms of tool geometrical parameters such as rake angle, nose radius, and machining parameters such as cutting speed, feed rate, and depth of cut. Central composite response surface methodology with five parameters and five levels was used to create a mathematical model, and the adequacy of the model was checked using analysis of variance. The experiments were conducted on aluminum Al 6351 with high-speed steel end mill cutter. Vibration in terms of acceleration amplitude during end milling was measured with two accelerometers—one in tool holder (channel I) and other in workpiece fixture (channel II) respectively. Optimizations of process parameters were performed using genetic algorithm. Sensitivity analysis was performed using developed equations to identify the parameter exerting most influence on vibration amplitude. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

The flavonoid concentration - time data was analyzed using second order and diffusion models. Both the temperature and solvent-to-feed ratio influenced the initial extraction rate and equilibrium concentration. Biot numbers were found to be greater than 50, implying that the internal mass transfer was the rate controlling step in MAE. The composition of extracts obtained using MAE and conventional extraction was similar. However, the effective diffusion coefficients were doubled in MAE when compared to conventional extraction. An empirical correlation was developed to predict the kinetics of MAE as a function of solvent-to-feed ratio and temperature. The study will be of interest to food and pharmaceutical industries.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: Sodium thiosulfate (STS) is a potent drug used to treat calcific uremic arteriopathy in dialysis patients and its mode of action is envisaged by calcium chelation and antioxidant potential. STS's action on mitochondrial dysfunction, one of the major players in the pathology of vascular calcification is yet to be explored. METHODS: Adenine (0.75%, 28 days)-treated vascular calcified rat kidney was used to isolate mitochondria, where the animal was administered with or without STS for 28 days. Isolated mitochondria were subjected to physiological oxidative stress by nitrogen gas purging (hypoxia/ischemia-reperfusion injury) to assess mitochondrial recovery extent due to STS treatment in vascular calcified rat kidney. RESULTS: The results confirmed an elevated oxidative stress and deteriorated mitochondrial enzyme activities in all groups except the drug-treated group. CONCLUSION: The STS treatment, besides rendering renal protection against adenine-induced renal failure, also helped to maintain mitochondrial functional integrity in a later insult due to hypoxia/ischemia-reperfusion injury. © 2017 Indian Journal of Pharmacology Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.},

abstract={The present paper accords about the conceptual design of a contemporary general aviation airship addressing supersonic flights. The aircraft market at this moment was portrayed by a negligible aircraft models and more than half of the aircraft in operation were older than 35 years. The aircraft cruising at a supersonic Mach number was encountered by a higher drag due to the presence of detached shockwave at the fuselage’s leading edge and significantly high thrust is essential to vanquish the drag occurred. A wedge shape fuselage nose was preferred. A wedge-shaped fuselage nose design renders more attached shockwave at the aircraft’s leading edge which results in the significant reduction in drag and thrust required for the aircraft to cruise at high altitudes. The wing section comprises of a thin airfoil, the usage of thin airfoil weaken the effect of pressure drag from the total drag imparted over the wing section of the aircraft. Collectively, a conceptual design of a modern general aviation aircraft was contrived intentionally to reduce the drag. © 2017, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc. All rights reserved.},

This work has an objective to examine design of a muffler and suggest improvement based on the analysis of natural modes of vibration of a ‘muffler’ using modal analysis in AN SYSTM and address damping issues if needed. Six modes on the muffler were picked and it was found that for an engine operating in range of 700 to 8000 rpm, the natural frequency of muffler matched with the operating frequency of engine leading to a case of resonance. To resolve this issue, an increase in the weight as well as provision of a downbeat stiffness to lower the modes of the shift function was preferred. A double layered design of muffler with an extra layer of 1 mm thickness and of an appropriate space between two outer layers was found as one solution. The vibration analysis of modified design showed that the fundamental frequency of muffler had shifted away from the frequency of operation of engine, which makes the muffler safe and less subjected to resonance. © 2017, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.

abstract={Study and optimization on active flux coating thickness during ATIG welding has significant importance in achieving good weld profile. Active flux of SiO2 with varying thickness has been coated on Al-8%SiC composite plate of 5mm thickness and subjected for TIG welding. From the weld profile it is observed that the increased weld penetration is achieved when active flux coating thickness ranges between optimal condition of 1 g/cm2 to 2 g/cm2.. Increase in coating thickness than optimal condition leads to decrease in weld penetration due to the difficulty in arc initiation. Decrease in coating thickness than the optimal condition, has no significant effect on the weld penetration. Increase in welding current with constant welding speed and arc length, tends to increase in weld profile such as increase in weld depth and also in weld width. During Active flux coating, increase in welding current tends to generate longitudinal crack, which in turn breaks the weld bead, while supplying a weld current of 120A. Active fluxes such as Al2O3, TiO2, MnO2. CaO and MgO coated on weld specimens breaks at 130A of welding current. This shows that the increase in heat input on weld zone tends to break the weld. ATIG-SiO2 shows highest weld depth to width ratio with significant increase in weld depth and weld width. Weld centre line crack has been observed in all other weld variants of ATIG welding but it was not observed during ATIG welding with SiO2 active flux coating. ATIG-SiO2 with 110A welding current was found to be more suitable for improvement in weld penetration. © 2017, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Al-SiC composite welded using PCTIG welding experiment is designed using Taguchi L9 orthogonal array to reduce the number experiments from 81 to 9 experimental conditions. The parameters considered for PCTIG welding are peak current, base current, pulse frequency and pulse on time. The mechanical properties such as bend strength, weld centre micro hardness and thermal profile for peak temperature & cooling rate are studied in the above experimental conditions. The Interaction effect, signal to noise (S/N) ratio and mean response are developed to find the influence of each pulsed current parameter at various levels & the percentage of influence by pulsed current parameters on bend strength, weld centre micro hardness and thermal profile of peak temperature & cooling rate are analysed. From the statistical analysis, it is observed that pulse frequency has higher effect on weld zone micro hardness and the influencing parameters on bending load are identified as peak current & pulse on time. It is observed that peak temperature is highly influenced by pulse on time and pulse on time & pulse frequency has higher influence on the cooling rate. The slight variation from the desired values of pulsed current TIG welding parameters leads to higher deviation in the response. PCTIG welding parameters of peak current of 160A, base current of 60A, pulse on time as 50% and pulse frequency as 5Hz shows desired optimal results. © 2017, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.

From the weld profile & weld bead appearance, arc length of 2mm with a welding speed of 2mm/s results in maximum weld penetration. Increase in arc length & welding speed reduces the welding depth & increases in weld width. From the mean effect study it is observed that Arc length has higher effect on weld depth & weld width than the welding speed. © 2017, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.

abstract={Madhuca longifolia is a traditional medicinal plant used in the treatment of several diseases including cancer in Indian system of medicine. Even though the chemical composition, bioactive principles and medicinal value of M. longifolia leaf have investigated earlier, the extraction of phytochemical compounds is not yet optimized, because preparation of extract will be of great importance as it could be used in several herbal formulations to treat variety of diseases. In the present study, we have employed different solvents (Hexane, ethyl acetate, methanol, ethanol and water) and different extraction conditions and also applied to optimize the extraction of phytochemicals from M. longifolia leaves. Effect of different solvent concentrations (50, 75 & 100%), extraction time (30, 75 and 120 min) and extraction temperature (30, 50 & 70°C) on the phenolic yield was evaluated using Response Surface Methodology (RSM). Methanol was the suitable solvent to yield maximum phenolic content (6744.24 mg GAE/100 g). Maximum yield of total phenols (7755 mg GAE/100 g) was achieved under the optimal conditions such as extraction temperature (50°C), extraction time (88 min) and solvent concentration (88%). Analysis of physicochemical properties indicated that the methanolic extract of M. longifolia possesses acceptable sensory qualities with low water solubility (36%). Analysis of antioxidant activity in terms of DPPH radical scavenging potential indicated that the methanolic extract of M. longifolia (62.45 mg/L) was stronger when compared to other medicinal plants. Extraction of phenolic compounds with strong antioxidant power from M. longifolia was optimized in the present work, which could be useful to incorporate it in the development of novel herbal formulations. In this direction, the presently optimized conditions will be helpful for their large-scale extraction for industrial applications. © 2017, Pharmainfo Publications. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Most bacterial genomes have multiple type II toxin-antitoxin systems (TAs) that encode two proteins which are referred to as a toxin and an antitoxin. Toxins inhibit a cellular process, while the interaction of the antitoxin with the toxin attenuates the toxin’s activity. Endoribonuclease-encoding TAs cleave RNA in a sequence-dependent fashion, resulting in translational inhibition. To account for their prevalence and retention by bacterial genomes, TAs are credited with clinically significant phenomena, such as bacterial programmed cell death, persistence, biofilms and anti-addiction to plasmids. However, the programmed cell death and persistence hypotheses have been challenged because of conceptual, methodological and/or strain issues. In an alternative view, chromosomal TAs seem to be retained by virtue of addiction at two levels: via a poison-antidote combination (TA proteins) and via transcriptional reprogramming of the downstream core gene (due to integration). Any perturbation in the chromosomal TA operons could cause fitness loss due to polar effects on the downstream genes and hence be detrimental under natural conditions. The endoribonucleases encoding chromosomal TAs are most likely selfish DNA as they are retained by bacterial genomes, even though TAs do not confer a direct advantage via the TA proteins. TAs are likely used by various replicons as ‘genetic arms’ that allow the maintenance of themselves and associated genetic elements. TAs seem to be the ‘selfish arms’ that make the best use of the ‘arms race’ between bacterial genomes and plasmids. © 2017 The Authors.},

abstract={Construction industry deals with the construction and maintenance of the environment creating roads, dams, buildings and bridges. It consistently improves the life of the people by upgrading the facilities for them. It employs many people all over the world and plays a strong role in globalization. Accidents are often recorded every year during construction and demolition. In India, most of the structures are not demolished even after their life span. This is unsafe for all the occupants of the old building. Demolishing of the structure is done before the end of its service life on most of the other countries. Similarly demolition should also be carried out wherever required in India keeping safety as of prime importance. Thus Structures are to be demolished at the end of their design life for the safety of the people residing in them and around so that accidents cannot happen. For various renovation and rehabilitation projects, demolishing of structures is done. Unplanned collapse of structures, exposure to hazardous chemicals and explosives, vibrations due to demolition affecting the adjacent structures and noise pollution are some of the common risks involved in demolition. The steps involved before demolition are proper pre-planning, preparation of a stability report and taking up the necessary safety measures. This paper gives a brief description about the different types of mechanical and chemical methods used for demolition. The need to manage the demolition waste has led to environment friendly actions such as sustainable demolition and recycled construction. This paper provides insight about managing the debris produced due to natural disasters and prevention of its impact on health of humans and the environment. This paper mainly helps to choose the right method for demolition, its key objective being the safety of both the workers, occupants and the environment. © 2017 IAEME Publication.},

abstract={Steganography play an important role to transfer secret data over insecure network. Moreover digital images are taken as a cover to communicate the sensitive data. One of the simplest approach of embedding the secret data into cover image is Least Significant Bit (LSB) method. This paper aims to propose a new symmetric key based image hiding technique. Pseudo random keys are generated by using 1D logistic map and those keys are used for choosing the pixel position of cover image randomly for hiding the secret image. The main security part of the projected method is the selection of pixel position in the cover image. Peak Signal Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Mean Square Error (MSE) measures are used for comparison and the result analysis shows that the proposed scheme provide efficient level of security.},

abstract={Increased consumption of raw and par-boiled rice results in the formation of methylglyoxal (MG) at higher concentration and leads to complications in diabetic patients. Highly sensitive electrochemical biosensor was developed using glutathione (GSH) as a co-factor with vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) as a nano-interface for MG detection in rice samples. The Pt/V2O5/GSH/Chitosan bioelectrode displayed two well-defined redox peaks in its cyclic voltammograms for MG reduction. This occurred as two electron transfer process where MG gained two electrons from oxidized glutathione disulfide and formed hemithioacetal. The current density response of the fabricated bioelectrode was linear towards MG in the concentration range of 0.1–100 μM with the correlation coefficient of 0.99, sensitivity of 1130.86 μA cm−2 μM−1, limit of detection of 2 nM and response time of less than 18 s. The developed bioelectrode was used for the detection of MG in raw and par-boiled rice samples. © 2017},

abstract={Suitability of dielectric constant was measured using designed layered capacitive cell in the quality analysis of palm, peanut and corn oil after three cycles of heating up to 190 °C of temperature. Dielectric constant value (at 2 MHz frequency) increases with three cycles of heating was experiential and correlated (R2 &gt; 0.973) with physical properties. Measured density, refractive index and dielectric constant (εr) were used to calculate specific refractive index and polarization using Debye's equation. To increase the mobility of polar compounds, 25% of CCl4 was added to 75% of oil; its capacitance and dielectric constant were experiential at different temperature (40 to 65 °C). Physical properties like relative viscosity, refractive index and electric dipole moment of oil solution were used to estimate; apparent molecular relaxation time, polarization of oil solution using Wyman's analyses. Variation of εr was fitted with empirical equations; the constants and regression coefficients for different times heated oil solution was determined. The dependency parameter R2 ranges from 0.956 to 0.999. The designed capacitor was used to measure dielectric constant of oil solution which would be a non-invasive and resolute property to study the storage life of oil in food industry. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

Two parameter Weibull distribution is frequently used statistical tool for modelling the flexural fatigue failure life exactly. In this article, a flexural fatigue failure life of self-compacting fibre reinforced concrete (FRC) were statistically commanded. Subsequently, a novel energy pattern factor method (NEPFM) has been proposed for the computation of Weibull shape parameter from the data of earlier researcher. The validity of the proposed NRPFM is verified with power density method and other researchers. The results revealed that the proposed NEPFM is appropriate and efficient to calculate the Weibull shape parameter for the flexural fatigue failure applications. © 2017 IAEME Publication.},

abstract={Silicon carbide (SiC) nanowire structures with and without hydrogen (H2) and ammonia (NH3) molecules have been constructed and optimized using density functional theory to study their electronic and transport properties. The adsorption energies calculated for the SiC nanowire structures reveal that the adsorption process of H2 and NH3 molecules is endothermic in nature. Nonequilibrium Green’s function transport theory is employed to study the electronic transport properties of the SiC nanowire devices with and without H2 and NH3 molecules. The voltage–current (V–I) characteristic shows negative differential resistance (NDR) behavior for all the SiC nanowire devices when bias voltage is applied. It is inferred that the NDR behavior is due to shift of quasibound states near the Fermi level because of the applied bias voltage. This observed NDR behavior may be useful for fabrication of nanoelectronic devices. © 2017, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.},

abstract={This investigation presents a fault diagnosis methodology for detecting sensor faults in cement industries pyro processing section. It works in three steps: (a) modelling, (b) analysis, and (c) validation. In the modelling, the actual data from the cement pyro processing is used to do a correlation analysis between output and input variables. The structural model is obtained from the correlation tests. During the analysis phase the Structural analysis Tool (SaTool) is used to detect the detectability and isolability of the faults. The results of the structural analysis are validated in a cement industry using residual analysis performed using structural sensor model and real-time measurements. The main advantages of this fault diagnosis technique are: (a) it requires only correlation analysis to obtain the structural model without a detailed physical model as in other methods, (b) conclusions regarding detectability and isolability can be easily drawn during the analysis stage itself, and (c) the method is simple compared to the model-based, and data-history based methods. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated using data from cement pyro processing plant and its performance is compared with model based approaches for four different types of sensor faults: (1) bias, (2) drift, (3) stuck, and (4) measurement failures. Our results demonstrate that the structural method is able to detect the sensor faults even in the presence of noisy information, and its performance is comparable with that of model based approaches without employing a physical model. © 2017},

abstract={In this study, our main focus is to investigate the effects of F doping and post deposition annealing (air and vacuum) on the optical and electrical characteristics of tantalum doped zinc oxide films (ZnO:Ta). A cost-effective, automated jet nebulizer spray pyrolysis technique is adopted to deposit the ZnO:Ta:F films. The doping level of Ta is kept constant (1 at.%) and that of F is varied from 5 to 20 at.% in steps of 5 at.%. The electrical resistivity of the as-deposited films decreases for 10 at.% of F concentration. The resistance increases thereafter. The same trend is also observed in annealed films. The reasons for these variations are addressed based on the effective F incorporation into the ZnO lattice and annealing atmosphere with the help of XRD, FESEM, AFM and PL studies. The incorporation of the dopants was confirmed from XPS and EDX analyses and the DFT studies show that the incorporation of the dopants does not affect the stability of the ZnO lattice. Vacuum-annealed films show better electrical properties over the as-deposited and air-annealed counterparts, though their transparency is affected marginally. A minimum resistivity of 0.81 × 10 −3 Ω cm and an enhanced quality factor of 2.265 × 10 −4 (Ω/sq) −1 are achieved for the vacuum-annealed films having Ta + F doping levels as 1 + 10 at.%. These results make this sample a desirable candidate for transparent electrode applications. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Influences of combined supplementation of calcium citrate (Ca-Cit) and calcium carbonate (CaCO3) on the hydroxyapatite/collagen (HAp/Col)-sodium alginate (Na-Alg) paste (HAp/Col paste) were investigated. Supplementation amounts of Ca-Cit and CaCO3 were denoted as Nx, where N is a multiplication number to Ca2+ ion amounts for the equivalent reaction with Na-Alg obtained previously. Combined supplementation of 10x Ca-Cit and 2x CaCO3 improved the anti-washout property at a washout ratio of 2.42 0.72% and pH maintenance at 7.34 0.08, these values were better than the best HAp/Col paste using Ca-Cit (5.91 2.73% washout ratio and 6.72 0.06 of pH). This is due to coordinate effects of initial washout inhibition by weak but rapid formation of long-range network by citric acid followed by long term anti-washout inhibition by strong but slow network formation by Ca2+ ions. The paste also showed good cytocompatibilty that MG63 cells proliferated with the culture time without any significant difference with the HAp/Col dense bodies. The HAp/Col paste is expected to be utilized in minimally invasive surgery of bone defect. © 2017 The Ceramic Society of Japan.},

abstract={Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a nosocomial pathogen colonizing patients with chronic infectious diseases and has gained resistance to all the known broad spectrum antibiotics available today. The present study showcases the antibiofilm potential of an essential oil (EO) from an underexplored Cinnamomum species namely, C. tamala, against P. aeruginosa biofilms. Furthermore, the synergistic effects of the EO along with a commercially available DNase (DNaseI) and a DNase (MBD) isolated from a marine bacterium were explored for its antibiofilm activity. The results showed that the synergized action has maximum efficacy in inhibiting young and preformed biofilms. The synergized effect of EO and DNaseI showed 70% inhibition against matured biofilms of P. aeruginosa. The EO from C. tamala also showed quorum sensing inhibitory potential as it could inhibit the swarming motility behavior of P. aeruginosa. The synergistic action of EO and DNases offers a novel alternate therapeutic strategy for combating P. aeruginosa biofilm associated infections. © 2017 Farisa Banu, Rubini, Rakshitaa, Chandrasekar, Murugan, Wilson, Gowrishankar, Pandian and Nithyanand.},

abstract={This research focuses on developing novel technique for a solar water heating system. The novel solar system comprises a parabolic dish concentrator, conical absorber and water heater. In this system, the conical absorber tube directly absorbs solar radiation from the sun and the parabolic dish concentrator reflects the solar radiations towards the conical absorber tube from all directions, therefore both radiations would significantly improve the thermal collector efficiency. The working fluid water is stored at the bottom of the absorber tubes. The absorber tubes get heated and increases the temperature of the working fluid inside of the absorber tube and causes the working fluid to partially evaporate. The partially vaporized working fluid moves in the upward direction due to buoyancy effect and enters the heat exchanger. When fresh water passes through the heat exchanger, temperature of the vapour decreases through heat exchange. This leads to condensation of the vapour and forms liquid phase. The working fluid returns to the bottom of the collector absorber tube by gravity. Hence, this will continue as a cyclic process inside the system. The proposed investigation shows an improvement of collector efficiency, enhanced heat transfer and a quality water heating system. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={A highly sensitive nonlinear temperature sensor, which is based on modulational instability (MI) process, is theoretically demonstrated for the first time using a CS2-filled photonic crystal fiber (CSPCF). The proposed novel temperature sensor works on the principle of measurement of a temperature-dependent wavelength shift of generated Stokes and anti-Stokes MI Sidebands. Based on the notion of MI dynamics, the performance of the proposed temperature sensor is studied in both anomalous and normal dispersion regimes of an appropriately designed CSPCF. It is found that the sensitivity of the proposed nonlinear temperature sensor is very low when the CSPCF is pumped in the anomalous dispersive region. However, the sensitivity is enhanced by more than 66 times using Stokes line in the normal dispersion regime. The proposed sensor is optimized by varying the structural parameters and pump parameters, such as pitch, air-hole diameter, pump wavelength, and pump power. The proposed nonlinear temperature sensor, which is made up of an appropriate structure of CSPCF having a length of 13 cm exhibits a sensitivity of -82 nm/°C using Stokes line and 435 nm/°C using anti-Stokes line while pumped with a power of 100 W in the normal dispersive region. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Geopolymer Concrete is typically proportioned with activator solution leading to moderately high material cost. Such cost can be enduring in high value added applications especially when cost savings can be recognized in terms of reduction in size of the members. Proper material selection and mix proportioning can diminish the material cost. In the present investigation, a total of 27 mixes were arrived considering the mix parameters as liquid-binder ratio, slag content and sodium hydroxide concentration to study the mechanical properties of geopolymer concrete (GPC) mixes such as compressive strength, split tensile strength and flexural strength. The derived statistical Response Surface Methodology is beleaguered to develop cost effective GPC mixes. The estimated responses are not likely to contrast in linear mode with selected variables; a plan was selected to enable the model of any response in a quadratic manner. The results reveals that a fair correlation between the experimental and the predicted strengths. Copyright © 2017 Techno-Press, Ltd.},

abstract={Powder metallurgy plain carbon steel (Fe-0.5% C) replaces gradually the conventional C45 steel in all industrial sectors due to its comparable strength and better metallurgical properties. This research investigates the influence of density/porosity of powder metallurgy plain carbon steel on wear characteristics and optimizes the wear working parameters to establish minimum wear loss and coefficient of friction during wear using Taguchi-grey relational optimization analysis. The sintered steel preforms were subjected to uni-axial compressive load (cold upset) to obtain various percentage theoretical densities. The wear test specimens made out of various densities of the sinter-forged plain carbon steel were used to conduct wear tests as per the test plan generated by the Design Expert software. The optical and scanning electron microscope images taken from the worn test specimens were used for the investigations of wear mechanisms of the alloy steel. It is observed from the wear test results that the porosity in the powder metallurgy plain carbon steel has a vital role in wear properties of the steel. It has also been found that the optimized working parameters such as speed and load are found as same irrespective of the densities of the plain carbon steel. © 2017 Institution of Mechanical Engineers.},

abstract={A general feature of all DC power supplies and nonlinear loads such as SMPS and computer systems connected to the AC mains is the presence of a diode rectifier terminated on a DC link capacitor. During this convertion, the supply current is pulsating in nature. This leads to the reduction in power factor and distortion in supply current. This necessitates the use of Power Factor Correction circuits for power electronic converters. In this work, high power factor and low harmonic distortion is achieved with the help of Interleaved Boost Converter. The Interleaved Boost Converter is implemented using both analog and digital proportional integral controller. Analog controller uses average current mode control technique with two control loops, namely a high bandwidth inner current control loop to have sinusoidal wave shape for input current and a low bandwidth outer voltage control loop to obtain a regulated output voltage. Digital controller uses Digital Pulse Width Modulation technique for the control system design. Mathematical modelling of Interleaved Boost Converter and stability analysis of the converter is carried out. The proposed Analog and Digital controller helps to obtain a regulated output voltage against disturbances in load. The simulation schematic covering the power and control circuit has been developed using MATLAB/Simulink software and the corresponding results are obtained. It is observed from the results that the THD of input current is reduced effectively and power factor is also improved. © 2006-2017 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN). All rights reserved.},

abstract={Abstract: Electronic structure, vibrational and NMR spectra of metal-Pillarplex (metal = Cu, Ag and Au) and its inclusion complex with 1,8-diaminooctane (DAO) are investigated by using density functional theory. The coordinated metal atoms tune the cavity size and the height of metal-Pillarplex and form a rigid cavity thereby reducing their structural deformation. Cu-Pillarplex undergoes a large deformation both on the host and guest molecule. The calculated Gibbs free energy for the formation of inclusion complex were negative indicating their facile formation at the room temperature. Computed binding energies with various functionals and energy decomposition analysis, shows that dispersion correction is essential in these systems. The low binding energy, and the physical adsorption of guest molecule and HOMO–LUMO spatial diagram indicates, that the Au and Ag-Pillarplex can be used as reversible host for linear alkanes Complexation of guest engenders frequency shift in the vibrational spectra. Calculated 1H NMR reveal that guest protons which are closer to the metal sites experience larger shielding possibly due to C–H→LP* metal interaction. The 15N signal observed for the DAO is nearly identical to that observed for the DAO@metal-Pillarplex. NBO and AIM analysis indicate that metal centers in host, play a major role in stabilizing the guest inside the cavity than the amino group on the guest molecule.

abstract={The structural and thermal properties of the passivated gold nanoparticles were explored employing molecular dynamics simulation for the different surface coverage densities of the self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of alkane thiol. The structural properties of the monolayer protected gold nanoparticles such us overall shape, organization and conformation of the capping alkane thiol chains were found to be influenced by the capping density. The structural order of the thiol capped gold nanoparticles enhances with the increase in the surface coverage density. The specific heat capacity of the alkane thiol capped gold nanoparticles was found to increase linearly with the thiol coverage density. This may be attributed to the enhancement in the lattice vibrational energy. The present simulation results suggest, that the structural and thermal properties of the alkane thiol capped gold nanoparticles may be modified by the suitable selection of the SAM coverage density. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Undoped and Cu doped ZnO nanopowders were synthesized by very simple and cost-effective soft chemical method by varying copper concentration as 10 at%, 20 at% and 30 at% for dye degradation test. Dense nanosheets of wurtzite structure with preferential growth of (101) were formed. The crystallite size decreases from 66.810 nm to 20.360 nm when the Cu content is increased. The photoluminescence results confirm the shift of near band edge emission (NBE) towards the lower wavelength with increasing doping concentration. Energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) studies confirms the presence of Zn, O and Cu elements in the prepared nano powders. Photocatalytic activity test was conducted for the prepared nanopowders against Methylyne Blue (MB) dye under visible light. The observed results show that the photocatalytic efficiency of the prepared nanopowders increase with the increase of Cu content. Theoretical study based on electrode potentials was performed by employing density functional theory (DFT) in order to validate the experimental results. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH},

abstract={We report on the facile electrodeposition of copper nanostructures on graphite lead substrate using anionic, cationic and non-ionic surfactant templates. Physical and electrochemical characterisation confirmed the influence of templates on the morphology and electrochemical catalytic activities of the copper electrodeposits. These electrodes were shown to be excellent electrocatalyst for the fast detection of hydrogen peroxide. A maximum sensitivity of 951.45 μA/mM/cm 2 , LOD of 0.43 μM, response time of  &lt;1 s and a linearity in wide range of concentration from 1 μM to 5 mM were observed when sodium dodecyl sulfate was used as the template. While most of the previously reported sensors have advantages either on the facile synthesis or fast detection of analyte, our methodology enables preparation of the electrode within 120 s and analysis within another 60 s without any complicated procedure, thereby demonstrating one of the fastest and cost-effective method for hydrogen peroxide analysis with high sensitivity and selectivity. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Patchouli essential oil (EO) from Pogostemon cablin (PC), is widely used in perfumery, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. Being a well-known commodity and used in many products, pharmacological and biological properties of patchouli EO is well studied. However, wild patchouli species, P. heyneanus (PH) and P. plectranthoides (PP), are least studied in all aspects. The present study is aimed at preparation and characterization of EO nanoemulsions of wild patchouli and to specifically study their antimicrobial and biofilm eradication activities against Shigella flexneri, multi-drug resistant (MDR) Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans in comparison with the commercial patchouli EO. The commercial and wild patchouli EOs showed wide variations in their chemical constituents as patchouli alcohol, acetophenone and atractylone were found to be the principal component of commercial (PC) and wild patchouli (PH and PP) EOs respectively. Among the EO nanoemulsions, PH EO nanoemulsion showed good stability and size on the first day and 45th day of preparation. Similarly, EO nanoemulsion of PH exhibited better antibacterial and anti-candida activities against the studied microbes than the other two EOs. In case of biofilm eradication activity, EOs of all three species eradicated the biofilms of S. mutans and S. aureus at a range of 30–50%. The study suggests that EO of PH possesses better antibacterial and anti-candida activities compared with the other two species. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

The band structure shows that CeO 2 nanostructure exhibits semiconducting nature. The electron density is found to be more in oxygen sites rather than in cerium sites along CeO 2 nanostructure. The density of states spectrum shows the variation in density of charge upon adsorption of CO on CeO2 device. The transmission spectrum provides the insights on the transition of charge in CeO 2 molecular device upon adsorption of CO along the scattering region. I–V characteristics confirm the adsorption of CO with the variation of current along CeO 2 molecular device.

abstract={In recent years, iron oxide incorporated highly oriented mesoporous silica has evinced considerable interest for biomedical applications due to its amenability to chemical modification, ability to be visualized through non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging and simultaneously deliver therapeutic molecules at the site of interest. However, reports on the biocompatibility of mesoporous silica are contradictory and information on the response of the biological system to these materials is relatively unknown. In our previous study we had reported the use of spherically modified iron oxide incorporated mesoporous silica (Sp-IO-MPS) as a theranostic tool. The present work focuses on the evaluation of the in vivo biodistribution of the material in rodents along with the histopathological profile of the tissues in treated animals. Organ distribution results show that the intravenously administered Sp-IO-MPSs are mainly deposited in the spleen within an hour of administration when compared to other tissues. This suggests that the presence of iron oxide in the mesopores direct these particles to localize preferentially in the spleen. Histopathology studies revealed that both mesoporous silica and the iron oxide incorporated mesoporous silica caused minimal toxicity to lungs and spleen after 60 h after administration while the other tissues remained unaffected. Taken together, this study reveals that iron oxide incorporated mesoporous silica can be used only for short-term applications while prolonged circulation of these materials may cause adverse effects in the lungs and spleen. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={This paper discusses the development of robust speech recognition system for recognizing the speech of the children with hearing impairment with no necessity to collect large amount of speech samples from them. They normally use sign language to communicate with others though they have perfect vocal structure to produce speech in the form of sequence of sounds. So, it is necessary to develop the system for recognizing their speeches especially in the native language and we have considered Tamil speaking hearing impaired children in our work. It is normally a challenging task to recognize the distorted speeches of hearing impaired speakers. But here the performance of the system is analyzed by applying the hearing impaired speeches directly on the models developed using the speeches of the normal speakers. This work uses Mel frequency perceptual linear predictive cepstrum as a feature at the front end and K means clustering at the back end for recognizing the speeches of the hearing impaired and the recognized speech uttered by normal speakers can be displayed as a visual output or audio output which can be clearly understandable by others. The approach to this issue employed RLS filtering as an additional preprocessing technique and correlation analysis is done between the RLS filtered speech and clean normal speech to select the corresponding clean normal speech from the set of several normal speeches. Hearing impaired speeches will be heard and interpreted clearly by the normal speakers and the system can be used to help the hearing impaired to improve their status in society.},

abstract={The present investigation was aimed to evaluate the release of both antioxidants and cellulosic fibre from different agro-food wastes. Cost-effective and easily available agro-food residues (brewers’ spent grains, hazelnut shells, orange peels and wheat straw) were selected and submitted to a double-step acid/alkaline fractionation process. The obtained acid and alkaline liquors were analysed for total phenols content and antioxidant capacity. The final fibre residue was analysed for the cellulose, lignin and hemicellulose content. The total phenols content and antioxidant capacity of the acid liquors were higher than the alkaline hydrolysates. Orange peels and wheat straw gave, respectively, the highest (19.70 ± 0.68 mg/g dm ) and the lowest (4.70 ± 0.29 mg/g dm ) total phenols release. Correlation between antioxidant capacity of the liquors and their origin depended on the analytical assay used to evaluate it. All the acid liquors were also rich in sugar degradation products (mainly furfural). HPLC analysis revealed that the most abundant phenolic compound in the acid liquors was vanillin for brewers’ spent grains, hazelnut shells and wheat straw, and p-hydroxybenzoic acid for orange peels. Wheat straw served as the best raw material for cellulose isolation, providing a final residue with a high cellulose content (84%) which corresponded to 45% of the original cellulose. The applied process removed more than 90% of the hemicellulose fraction in all the samples, while delignification degree ranged from 67% (in hazelnut shells), to 93% (in brewers’ spent grains). It was not possible to select a unique raw material for the release of highest levels of both total phenols and cellulose. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In this paper, an online fault detection and classification method is proposed for thermocouples used in nuclear power plants. In the proposed method, the fault data are detected by the classification method, which classifies the fault data from the normal data. Deep belief network (DBN), a technique for deep learning, is applied to classify the fault data. The DBN has a multilayer feature extraction scheme, which is highly sensitive to a small variation of data. Since the classification method is unable to detect the faulty sensor; therefore, a technique is proposed to identify the faulty sensor from the fault data. Finally, the composite statistical hypothesis test, namely generalized likelihood ratio test, is applied to compute the fault pattern of the faulty sensor signal based on the magnitude of the fault. The performance of the proposed method is validated by field data obtained from thermocouple sensors of the fast breeder test reactor. © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) is being suggested for critical applications like border surveillance, difficult mapping and atmosphere studies. Especially in military application, it saves money and lives of soldiers compared to manned military aircraft. Major problems in the forest border region are human - animal interaction and animals poaching. With the help of the complete surveillance, these problems can able to solve. Nowadays the surveillance around the forest has been carried out by forest officers. Monitoring the forest through officers is not complete surveillance, due to the natural factors of human beings may be the error will occur in the monitoring. To avoid this problem, the monitoring of the forest region is to be covered by UAV. Animal activities and large forest coverage area is difficult task to handle in forest monitoring, so a normal UAV is not suitable for this process, hence Hexacopter is a better solution for this monitoring because it's a have unique characters like high operational speed, more stability, etc. The proposed Hexacopter would be capable of the vertical take-off and landing feature like a rotary wing aircraft and also the six propellers provides the more stability and high manuvering capability during the monitoring process. This Hexacopter payload is about 1kg and total dimension is of 500mm x 500mm, the main purpose of this hexacopter is to provide the wealthy surveillance in the forest and gives an alert about the animal's exact position and takes necessary action. The estimated design of hexacopter has been modeled by CATIA. With the help of the MATLAB 10.0 the image processing has been carried out in order to find the animal detection, animal hunting and animal counting. The emergency system will be activating in account of error animal matching percentage output from image processing. ©2006-2017 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN). All rights reserved.},

abstract={Tin oxide (SnO2) thin films were prepared by nebulizer spray pyrolysis (n-SP) of SnCl2.2H2O precursor on glass substrates preheated at substrate temperatures varying from 200 °C to 500 °C. The structural, surface, and optical studies of the films were carried out to validate the results of the electrical analysis which support the utilization of the prepared films for the transparent conducting applications in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The X-ray diffraction patterns revealed that the films are polycrystalline in nature with high crystalline quality, relatively at a lower substrate temperature of 350 °C. Film thickness was found to be around 350 nm, and the crystallite size was in the range of 50 nm with low lattice strain and dislocation density. The surface morphological analysis shows the uniform surfaces with homogeneous, closely-packed grains. Optical studies indicate that the films are highly uniform, and good optical quality with 80% transparency was observed at 560 nm for the films deposited at 350 °C. The electrical measurements revealed that the films were n-type with the electrical resistivity in the range of 7.83 × 10− 2 Ω-cm. Subsequently, fluorine doping reduced the film resistivity further to 2.9 × 10− 3 Ω-cm. The dye-sensitized solar cell device structure (Glass/FTO/TiO2 film/N-719 dye/electrolyte/platinized FTO/Glass, having a surface area of 1 cm2) developed using the optimized fluorine doped tin oxide thin films, generates the conversion efficiency of 4.02% under AM 1.5 illumination of simulated solar light. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={A new lectin was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity from pronase treated human serum by a single-step of affinity chromatography on concanavalin A-Sepharose 4B. The isolated lectin agglutinated five types of vertebrate RBC, with highest titer against hen RBC. This activity was independent of divalent cations, insensitive to EDTA and specific to mannosamine, glucosamine as well as galactosamine. Purified lectin gave a single symmetrical peak in its native form with a molecular mass estimate of 6 kDa in FPLC analysis and 6.5 kDa by MALDI-TOF MS. SDS-PAGE analysis of the lectin revealed that it is a homo-oligomer of a 3 kDa subunit protein. Isolated lectin did possess both, hemagglutinating and phenoloxidase activities, but did not exhibit any antibacterial or antifungal activities. In addition, this lectin could oxidize all nine different phenolic substrates tested, with hydroquinone proving to be the best among them. Phenoloxidase inhibitors namely, phenylthiourea and tropolone inhibited this oxidation activity. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Infectious keratitis is a major cause of blindness, next to cataract and majority of cases are mainly caused by gram negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa). In this study, we investigated a P. aeruginosa VRFPA10 genome which exhibited susceptibility to commonly used drugs in vitro but the patient had poor prognosis due to its hyper virulent nature. Genomic analysis of VRFPA10 deciphered multiple virulence factors and P.aeruginosa Genomic Islands (PAGIs) VRFPA10 genome which correlated with hyper virulence nature of the organism. The genome sequence has been deposited in DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank under the accession numbers LFMZ01000001-LFMZ01000044. © 2017},

abstract={Abstract: Protein aggregation, due to the imbalance in the concentration of Cu2+ and Zn2+ ions is found to be allied with various physiological disorders. Copper is known to promote the oxidative damage of β/γ-crystallins in aged eye lens and causes their aggregation leading to cataract. Therefore, synthesis of a small-molecule ‘chelator’ for Cu2+ with complementary antioxidant effect will find potential applications against aggregation of β/γ-crystallins. In this paper, we have reported the synthesis of different Schiff bases and studied their Cu2+ complexation ability (using UV–Vis, FT-IR and ESI-MS) and antioxidant activity. Further based on their copper complexation efficiency, Schiff bases were used to inhibit Cu2+-mediated aggregation of recombinant human γD-crystallin (HGD) and β/γ-crystallins (isolated from cataractous human eye lens). Among these synthesized molecules, compound 8 at a concentration of 100 μM had shown ~95% inhibition of copper (100 μM)-induced aggregation. Compound 8 also showed a positive cooperative effect at a concentration of 5–15 μM on the inhibitory activity of human αA-crystallin (HAA) during Cu2+-induced aggregation of HGD. It eventually inhibited the aggregation process by additional ~20%. However, ~50% inhibition of copper-mediated aggregation of β/γ-crystallins (isolated from cataractous human eye lens) was recorded by compound 8 (100 μM). Although the reductive aminated products of the imines showed better antioxidant activity due to their lower copper complexing ability, they were found to be non-effective against Cu2+-mediated aggregation of HGD.

abstract={The physicochemical, thermal, pasting and microstructural properties of commercial Curcuma angustifolia starch were analyzed. Scanning electron and light microscopic analyses revealed that the starch granules were polyhedral to round in shape, and were similar to corn starch in appearance. The mean particle diameter was 15.57 μm at 3% moisture, which increased to 16.79 μm at 12% moisture content after adsorbing water. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy revealed that the O[sbnd]C stretching band was double-peaked. X-ray diffractogram manifested mostly ‘A’ type crystalline structures, similar to that of arrowroot and corn starches. The NMR spectrum of this starch also resembled closely that of corn starch, with typical resonances at 100, 71–78 and 60 ppm. The moisture sorption isotherms of C. angustifolia starch were sigmoidal shape, with cross over at higher temperature. The glass transition temperature (Tg) decreased linearly from 70.15 °C at 3% moisture content to 64.65 °C at 12% (R2 = 0.985) while the peak gelatinization temperature of starch was 78.2 °C, with an enthalpy of 20.43 J/g. Thermogravimetric analysis showed that 76% of mass loss related to depolymerization of starch occurred between 275 and 345 °C. The derivative curve was single-peaked. Pasting studies showed that C. angustifolia starch showed peak, breakdown and setback viscosities much higher than those of cassava and arrowroot starches. The high phosphorous content conferred high paste viscosity and improved gel strength during pasting. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Remarkable features that are achieved in a protein–protein complex to precise levels are stability and specificity. Deviation from the normal levels of specificity and stability, which is often caused by mutations, could result in disease conditions. Chemical nature, 3-D arrangement and dynamics of interface residues code for both specificity and stability. This article reviews roles of interfacial residues in transient protein–protein complexes. It is proposed that aside from hotspot residues conferring stability to the complex, a small set of ‘rigid’ residues at the interface that maintain conformation between complexed and uncomplexed forms, play a major role in conferring specificity. Exceptionally, ‘super hotspot’ residues, which confer both stability and specificity, are attractive sites for interaction with small molecule inhibitors. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Biofilms have been involved in a wide variety of microbial infections in the human body. The biofilm organism has also been recognized as a survival policy for pathogens. Some microorganisms in biofilm can even modulate the pathogenic potential of bacteria as evident from carcinogenic bacteria in plaque biofilm. Microbial adhesion and biofilm formation onto biomedical device exteriors are considered the vital pathogenic mechanism of implant infections. According to the latest public statement, more than 65% of all microbial infections are caused by biofilms. These infections increase with use of catheters or urethral devices, where bacteria are able to form biofilms. Catheters and urethral devices are usually made up of silicon or latex, frequently colonized by Gram-negative bacteria, e.g., Klebsiella pneumoniae. Biofilms can also be related to other diseases that are not acquired as a result of a patient's hospitalization. Gingivitis, caries, periodontitis, otitis, or other infections on chronic wounds are examples of these infections. In the medical world, nanotechnology is seen as a boon because it can help by creating what are called smart drugs, which help to treat people faster and without side effects, which are common with other traditional drugs. The antimicrobial activity of silver, copper, zinc, iron, and other metal ions is well known and the element silver has been described as having the highest level of toxicity for microorganisms and the lowest level of toxicity for animal cells. In fact, this metal has a broad antimicrobial spectrum against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The present research has highlighted the study of inhibitory properties of biosynthesized silver iodide nanoparticles to battle biofilm infection. © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Smart meter is an advanced energy meter which not only measures the electrical energy consumption, but also provides real time data on power consumed by electrical loads. Any smart meter needs an infrastructure, wired/wireless, for data communication with the central server. To enable this two-way communication link, we propose a narrowband Power Line Communication (PLC) system operating at a rate of few kbps and this can be deployed over existing outdoor/indoor power lines. Our design demonstrates reusing the existing wired electrical network to provide communication between the smart meter and a central server. A low-cost dedicated hardware for measuring the power usage of electrical appliance is designed. Further, a user interface is developed to remotely access the power usage measurements stored at the central hub database with features of power management. With the usage data at hand, smart decisions can be made in saving energy and, reducing carbon foot-prints. Our design uses low cost and off the shelf devices and no additional wiring as it communicates over the existing power line infrastructure. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Nonlinear localized magnetic excitation in a periodic array of ferromagnetic alloy is investigated by applying periodic magnetic field of spatially varying strength. The governing Landau-Lifshitz (LL) equation is transformed into variable coefficient nonlinear Schrödinger (VCNLS) equation using stereographic projection. By using similarity transformation technique and with certain integrability conditions, the VCNLS equation is reduced to standard Nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equation. The solution of VCNLS equation is obtained by using the known bright and dark soliton solutions of the standard NLS equation provided the VCNLS equation must satisfy the integrability conditions. The results suggest a way to control the dynamics of magnetization of the periodic array of ferromagnetic alloy structure in the form of soliton by choosing the suitable ferromagnetic alloys which satisfies the integrability conditions. From the obtained soliton solutions, it is found that by choosing different combination of ferromagnetic alloys to form a periodic composite ferromagnetic structure one can control the amplitude and width of the soliton solution. © 2017 Author(s).},

abstract={The encapsulation of nucleobases inside CB7 has gained prominence due to its use as anticancer and antiviral drugs. With this respect, the nonconvalent interactions existing in the nucleobases encapsulated inside the CB7 cavity have been analyzed employing the dispersion corrected density functional theory. The CBn cavity has the ability to encapsulate two guest nucleobases molecules when they are aligned in parallel configuration. The computed association energy using the two- and three-body correction method computed at B3LYP-D3 level is close to the experimental estimate. The use of dispersion corrected DFs is essential to identify the correct binding energies. The solvation energy plays a vital role in the estimation of association energy. QTAIM analysis shows that the Laplacian of the charge density (2ρ) is negative and the presence of covalent interaction between the guest and host molecule. The NCI-RDG isosurface shows the presence of noncovalent intermolecular interactions such as van der Waals and hydrogen bonding. The existence of "splattering" of charges in guanine@CB7 molecule is responsible for its higher stability. From the AIM, NCI-RDG, and EDA results, we conclude that noncovalent and electrostatic interaction with partial covalent character exists in the intermolecular bonding between the host and the guest nucleobases. The ramification of such intermolecular bonds is reflected in the 1H NMR and 13NMR spectra. © 2017 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Quad copters are VTOL aerial robot systems and has complex dynamics in spite of its simple design. In the present work, a quadcopter of plus configuration is assembled and its flight characteristics are experimentally studied. To stabilize the system during its flight a KK multicopter platform is used. Flight stabilization is done and data of motor input voltage is acquired using a arducopter flight board. The flight dynamics of such a system is briefly explained in Part I of this paper. In this paper the numerical simulation of such a quad copter is done using Matlab Simulink. The work includes motor dynamics and the nonlinearities involved in the governing equations. The voltage data acquired during the flight of the experimental system is given as an input and its motion control analysis is done. The results of the experiments and developed mathematical model are compared. They are fairly in agreement with each other which validate the present model.

abstract={Droplet impingement cooling on flat surfaces finds its applications in spray cooling of hot surfaces, deposition of molten metal on surfaces, plasma coating, cooling of brake pad, turbine blade and in electronic chip cooling. Optimization of such a process requires a thorough understanding of the hydrodynamic process which happens during impingement of the droplet on the surface. Image processing techniques can be employed to understand the process. Image processing is converting an image into digital form and analyzing it, to get an improved image and extracting the desired information from it. The technique is widely used in face detection, remote sensing applications, machine vision and industrial robotics. In the present work an image processing algorithm is developed for a specific surface cooling technique. A hot surface is treated by impinging droplets. The size of the droplets can alter the material characteristics significantly. The objective of the present work is to develop an image processing algorithm to find the droplet dimensions. The variation in radius and height is examined with the help of Matlab software. Edge detection techniques are used to determine the boundaries of the droplet clearly. The algorithm is developed using Matlab toolbox and is capable of measuring droplet height and spreading radius in detail. The advantage of this algorithm is that the technique can be employed to the process in real time. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Many channel assignment methods are used in cellular networks in allocating the frequencies or channels to the corresponding cells. The assignment strategy of channels should target the maximal efficiency of channels which satisfies the different constraints of the network. The problem of fixing the channels to mobile stations, an NP-hard problem, is solved using the different soft computing strategies. The clique partition problem is partitioning of G into a fixed least number of cliques constrained with every vertex is available in a unique clique. This paper focuses on the new genetic algorithm with use of clique partitioning in solving channel allocation. The proposed strategy works well even for the smaller N, the population size and achieves high stochastic convergence with low fitness thresholds. Even for the larger problem instances, the maximum simulation run length is set to 50000 which yield higher fitness threshold limits. The comparison of simulated results of this proposed method with existing techniques is presented and the experimental outcomes are better than those techniques. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Continuous and accurate fluid delivery is a real challenge in many of the modern industrial applications such as continuous subcutaneous infusion, micro fluidics, delivery of hydrogel in rapid 3D printing, liquid-liquid micro extraction, etc. In most of the drug delivery systems, drug needs to be injected at a rate even less than a drop per minute. So in order to design such a precise delivery system that ensures continuous flow, there arises a need to employ different mechanisms depending upon the applications. In the present work, rotary to linear converting mechanism using rack and pinion with and without worm wheel for a double acting syringe pump is simulated using Matlab-Simulink toolbox. To have high accuracy in position of the syringe plunger, a 1.8 degree stepper motor is considered as a syringe actuator. The rack and pinion assembly consists of only two members i.e. a toothed rack and a pinion gear. The simulation results show that the designed mechanism is able to deliver the fluid continuously with precise delivery. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Quad rotors are vertical takeoff and landing systems (VTOL) which are most commonly used in surveillance, search and rescue operations, aerial photography and in automated applications. Ready to fly (RTF) quadcopter systems are now available in markets which are primarily used for various civilian applications in such a way that even a beginner without any knowledge of such systems can operate on it. The objective of the present work differs from such RTF systems. The paper focuses on assembling a quadcopter system using standard components and flying it in a stabilized manner using manual control. The stabilized flight data is acquired using a standard DAQ which is an integral part of the flying system. In part II of this work the data acquired as voltage signals which are the input to the four motors which control the flight are given as input for a mathematical model developed using MATLAB Simulink. The results of experiments carried in Part I is compared with the model developed in Part II. The logged data could be used to study the stabilization process of the flight controller which is a primary requirement for automation of the system without relying on a manual control. This will be a source for future work for complete automation of a stable flight quadcopter. The data logged during flight time is presented. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={This research work is to study the comparison between a response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial neural network (ANN) in the modelling and prediction of delamination factor during endmilling of glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) composites. Aiming to achieve this goal, several milling experiments were performed with polycrystalline diamond inserts at different machining parameters namely feed rate, cutting speed, depth of cut and fibre orientation angle. Mathematical model is created using central composite face centred second-order in RSM and the adequacy of the model was verified using analysis of variance. ANN model is created using back propagation algorithm. With regard to the machining test, it was observed that feed rate is the dominant parameter that affects the delamination factor followed by the fibre orientation. The comparison results show that models provide accurate prediction of delamination factor in which ANN perform better than RSM. The data predicted from ANN is very nearer to experimental results compared to RSM, therefore we can use this ANN model to determine the delamination factor for various FRP composites and also for various machining parameters. © 2015 Engineers Australia.},

abstract={Background: In this study, we present a juvenile retinoschisis patient with developmental delay, sensorineural hearing loss, and reduced axial tone. X-linked juvenile retinoschisis (XLRS) is a retinal dystrophy, most often not associated with systemic anomalies and also not showing any locus heterogeneity. Therefore it was of interest to understand the genetic basis of the condition in this patient. Materials and methods: RS1 gene screening for XLRS was performed by Sanger sequencing. Whole genome SNP 6.0 array analysis was carried out to investigate gross chromosomal aberrations that could result in systemic phenotype. In addition, targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) was employed to determine any possible involvement of X-linked syndromic and non-syndromic mental retardation genes. This NGS panel consisted of 550 genes implicated in several other rare inherited diseases. Results: RS1 gene screening revealed a pathogenic hemizygous splice site mutation (c.78+1G>T), inherited from the mother. SNP 6.0 array analysis did not indicate any significant chromosomal aberrations that could be disease-associated. Targeted resequencing did not identify any mutations in the X-linked mental retardation genes. However, variations in three other genes (NSD1, LARGE, and POLG) were detected, which were all inherited from the patient’s unaffected father. Conclusions: Taken together, RS1 mutation was found to segregate with retinoschisis phenotype while none of the other identified variations were co-segregating with the systemic defects. Hereby, we infer that the multisystemic defects harbored by the patient are a rare coexistence of XLRS, developmental delay, sensorineural hearing loss, and reduced axial tone reported for the first time in the literature. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Process capability indices (PCIs) are extensively used in the manufacturing industries in order to confirm whether the manufactured products meet their specifications or not. PCIs can be used to judge the process precision, process accuracy, and the process performance. So developing of sampling plans based on PCIs is inevitable and those plans will be very much useful for maintaining and improving the product quality in the manufacturing industries. In view of this, we propose a variables sampling system based on the process capability index Cpmk, which takes into account of process yield and process loss, when the quality characteristic under study will have double specification limits. The proposed sampling system will be effective in compliance testing. The advantages of this system over the existing sampling plans are also discussed. In order to determine the optimal parameters, tables are also constructed by formulating the problem as a nonlinear programming in which the average sample number is minimized by satisfying the producer and consumer risks. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Taurolipids (NAT) are a newer class of fatty acid amides (FAA) identified in the central nervous system, liver, and kidney of fatty acid amide hydrolase knockout mice. In this study, we reported a convenient method to synthesize NATs in fair yield and characterized using FTIR, 1H NMR and 13C NMR. Fluorescence spectroscopy study showed that NATs form micelles in an aqueous environment and the critical micellar concentration (CMC) follows a linear trend with respect to fatty acid acyl chain length. Differential scanning calorimetry reveals that NATs undergoes broad endothermic transition with transition temperatures increases with increasing fatty acid acyl chain length though the magnitude of change from one chain length to another chain length decreases as the acyl chain length increase. The transition enthalpy (ΔHt) and transition entropy (ΔSt) corresponding to the chain-melting phase transition depends linearly on the acyl chain length and fitted to a linear equation, which yielded the incremental values, ΔHinc (1.09 ± 0.03 kcal·mol− 1) and ΔSinc (2.96 ± 0.16 cal·mol− 1·K− 1), contributed by each methylene unit to ΔHt and ΔSt. The end contributions arising from the head group and the terminal methyl group were calculated to be ΔH0 = − 7.28 ± 0.46 kcal·mol− 1 and ΔS0 = − 17.36 ± 2.11 cal·mol− 1·K− 1. Thermodynamic parameters, incremental values of ΔHinc and ΔSinc suggest that the acyl chains in NATs are tightly packed and the obtained larger negative ΔS0 suggest that the hydration of polar sulfonate group of NATs also play an important role in the self-assembly of NATs. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

The state-of-the-art provides insights on to the development of new two dimensional materials with the surface passivation on boron nanostructures. The density of states spectrum provides a clear perception on charge transfer upon adsorption of alcohol vapors on borophane nanosheets. The monolayer of borophane band gap widens upon adsorption of alcohol vapors, which can be used for the detection for volatile organic vapors. The adsorption properties of alcohol vapors on borophane base material are analyzed in terms of natural bond orbital, average energy gap variation, adsorption energy and energy gap. The most suitable adsorption sites of methanol, ethanol and 1-propanol molecules on borophane nanosheet are investigated in atomistic level. The adsorption of alcohol molecules on borophane nanosheet is found to be more favorable.

To manage the trade-offs between security, speed and power consumption, the proposed encryption algorithm is modeled in Cyclone II Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The proposed design occupies only 4025 logical elements and takes 0.28 ms for encrypting an image of size 256 × 256. Robustness of the algorithm is estimated using quality metrics including statistical and differential attack analysis. The proposed scheme is resistant to most of the known attacks and is more secure than other image encryption schemes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Recently, the development of confidentiality and authenticity ensured by image encryption has been one of the key advancements in the field of secured wireless communication. The proposed work focuses on providing confusion, diffusion and permutation inherently in the system. The input grayscale image is shuffled by employing the Henon algorithm and subsequently separated into 8 bit planes. With the aid of a secret key of 256 bits, chaotic sequences are generated for each bit plane. Later, the logistic map is adapted on the chaotic sequences to obtain the scrambled image. Furthermore, this image is shuffled with Zaslavskii and Hilbert Space Filling Curve algorithms, which establishes the confusion stage. To incorporate the diffusion stage, a self-invertible matrix is generated by a latin square image cipher and a secret key. This matrix and the scrambled image underwent the Hill cipher to build the encrypted image followed by a row-column transformation to ensure multifold security. The proposed compound activities of encryption are successfully implemented on the laboratory virtual instrumentation engineering workbench 2013 platform. Noticeably, the established processes of image encryption are tested in the universal software radio peripheral environment and transceived via an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. More specifically, the influence of natural and unnatural (cropping attack) noise on the characteristics of the encrypted image while sharing through AWGN channel has been investigated. Security analysis is performed by computing the unified average changing intensity, number of pixels change rate, correlation value, large key space to defy brute force attack, strong key sensitivity and uniform gray value distribution on encryption. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={This study evaluates slope stability of 19km stretch Bodimettu ghat section, Theni,Tamil Nadu. The study involves 107.8km to 117.5km stretch by dividing it into two zones - Kaththuparai and Bodimettu slope. These two sections are considered for slope stability studies. In this study, analysis of the rock slope stability was performed using Modified SMR technique. Hoek and Bray (1981) analysis have been used for rock cut slopes. 12 rock slopes were identified in Kaththuparai section and four slopes in Bodimettu section. The detailed field investigations were carried out to collect data required for RMR and SMR calculation and SMR was calculated for each section. As per Hoek and Bray (1981) stereographic projection methods, FOS was calculated. In this study, sections R1 and R2 fulfill wedge conditions and R1, R2, R5, R7, R9, R10, R11, R12, R13, R14 and R16 are suitable for planar and stereographic analysis. The details are furnished in this paper. The planar analysis shows that, FOS for the sections R2/J2, R5, R9, R10, and R11/J3 was < 1, and stereographic projection study shows that sections R2, R5, R7, R9, R10, R11/J3 and R13 are present in unstable zone. © 2017, Geological Society of India.},

In our proposed method in Section 1 Superior Node Selection Mechanism (SNSM), we suggest an approach for selection of superior nodes within a region.

abstract={Application of multiple response optimizations using desirability function in the production of microbial metabolites improves economy and efficiency. Concurrent production of cellulase and xylanase in Trichoderma reesei NCIM 1186 using an agricultural weed, Prosopis juliflora pods, was studied. The main aim of the study was to optimize significant medium nutrient parameters for maximization of cellulase and xylanase by multi-objective optimization strategy using biomass. Process parameters such as the nutrient concentrations (pods, sucrose, and yeast extract) and pH were investigated to improve cellulase and xylanase activities by one factor at a time approach, single response optimization and multi-objective optimization. At the corresponding optimized process parameters in single response optimization, the maximum cellulase activity observed was 3055.65 U/L where xylanase highest activity was 422.16 U/L. Similarly, the maximum xylanase activity, 444.94 U/L, was observed with the highest cellulase activity of 2804.40 U/L. The multi-objective optimization finds a tradeoff between the two objectives and optimal activity values in between the single-objective optima were achieved, 3033.74 and 439.13 U/L for cellulase and xylanase, respectively. © 2017, The Author(s).},

abstract={The performance of RSA depends strongly on the competent implementation of modular multiplication and modular exponentiation. Performance can be improved in three ways: (i) by reducing the frequency of modular multiplications; (ii) by reducing the time required to evaluate modular multiplication; (iii) by increasing the RSA cores. This work proposes enhancements to the Montgomery Multiplication and also to Square & Multiply algorithm. Bit Forwarding 1-bit (BFW1) algorithm has been implemented to evaluate modular exponentiation that resulted in 11.11% improvement in throughput, and 1.90% reduction in power consumption. A Dual-core RSA processor with a hardware scheduler has been designed for performing concurrent cryptographic transformations to attain better throughput without increasing the frequency. The proposed hardware scheduler is able to increase the throughput of 95.85% for MSM algorithm and 117.61% for BFW1 for 1024-bit key with reference to the MME42_C2 algorithm. The results have been verified for a key of length 1024-bits, up to 32-cores. This is scalable, by proportionally increasing BRAM and priority queue size. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The present study signifies the development of a unique, optimized procedure for both selective determination and separation of different flavonoid nutraceuticals from edible plants. Totally ten different flavonoids were determined (HPLC–DAD) and isolated from five different plants using the developed process with a remarkable purity of 91–98% and recovery of 88–95%. Box–Behnken experimental design model yielded a optimized amount of 40.36 mg/g of AI extract (Pinostrobin) and 28.95 mg/g of AI extract (Baicalein) with a high correlation coefficient (0.98–0.99), indicating a good fit between the second order regression model and the experimental observations. The final purity of compounds through optimized process is 97.1% (Pinostrobin) and 93.5% (Baicalein) respectively. The optimized yields depicted a total recovery of 92% for pinostrobin, and 89% for Baicalein respectively. Thus, the developed process worked as a potential alternative which when statistically optimized results in a remarkable recovery of flavonoids from various plants. Being an environmentally friendly protocol the process could be useful in industrial separation of commercially important flavonoids widely applied in food industry. © 2017, Association of Food Scientists & Technologists (India).},

abstract={Casting is one of the most important process in manufacturing environment to develop a product for the customer needs and satisfaction. There is lot of casting process available in industrial world. Among various casting process, sand casting is one of the important process generally used for both ferrous and non ferrous materials. The solidification range of molten metal plays a vital role in sand casting process to decide the quality of the product. During solidification process, the results of casting defects such as shrinkage, porosity and hot tears are eliminated and a standard casting design system is essential which can be achieved by an experimental investigation. Recently, Aluminum (6063) plays a major role in automobile, manufacturing, nuclear and marine industries. In this experimental investigation, crucible furnace is used to melt the material and develop the product through sand casting methods. The important input process parameters such as vent hole angle and vent hole diameter are selected and studied at three different levels according to the recommendation of Design of Experiments Approach. The main objective of this experimental investigation is to find the optimum level of hardness in sand casting process by using Aluminum (6063) material. The hardness quality of test specimen is measured by using the Brinell hardness tester. This experimental results shows that, vent hole diameter plays a crucial role in hardness of sand casting process and the optimum level is recommended for further research. © 2017.

If SVD detects any false fault, it is also re-evaluated by the SDF, i.e., the model has two layers of checking to balance the false alarms.

In the absence of randomized clinical trials or large studies, the only information we have about the natural history and the management is from isolated clinical case series. They have suggested that surgery is beneficial, with conflicting results on the role of complete resection and adjuvant radiation. We have conducted a systematic review of clinical case series of CNS hemangiopericytoma analyzing the biology of the tumor and the best follow-up and management strategy. Methods: Fifteen pertinent clinical case series on newly diagnosed CNS hemangiopericytoma were selected by a review of literature. A total of 523 patients were analyzed for age, sex, mode of recurrence and metastases, and survival after complete/incomplete resection with or without radiation. Results: The mean age was found to be 44.17 (±3.59) years. The incidence was higher in male individuals younger than 45 years and in older female individuals. Complete resection and adjuvant radiation significantly improved survival in comparison with incomplete resection and no radiation, respectively (P<0.0001). Furthermore, a significant trend of the tumor to recur locally compared with extraneural and neural axis metastases was noted (P<0.0001). The mean time for distant metastases was seen to be 91.33 (±12.66) months. Conclusions: Complete resection followed by adjuvant radiation improves survival. Extraneural metastases, especially to lung, bone, and liver, are not uncommon and can occur late in the disease course for which continued follow-up is required. There is also a need to establish a systemic treatment regimen to control the distant metastases. © 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.},

abstract={This investigation presents optimal selection of Proportional Integral (PI) controller parameters for the speed control in Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM). Optimal selection of PI controller parameters is necessary to improve performance of PMSM. For this purpose, this investigation uses two evolutionary optimization algorithms namely, Real coded Genetic Algorithm (RGA) and Bio-geography Based Optimization (BBO) algorithm. In order to showcase the improvements obtained by PI controller tuned using RGA and BBO algorithms, their performances are compared with the conventional PI controller. Our results indicates that the PI controller tuned using BBO algorithm provides better transient and steady state performance for PMSM. © IEEE 2017.},

abstract={It is very challenging task to recognize user action and reaction corresponding to that in real time. Online dynamic signature stands for capturing signature of a person in real time whenever and wherever it is required. In this paper, we are designing a prototype consisting of a digital tablet, pen and microcontroller transmission board to sense the online gesture and collect the same. Personal computer receives the signature transmitted by the transmitter that is connected to digital tablet. Acceleration that obtains instantaneously, rotation, as well as other various informations are captured by dynamic data for signing procedure. Later recording the captured information, preprocessing steps will be carried out in which unwanted noise information will be eliminated. Using the proposed algorithm we are able to authenticate the user effectively. False rejection rate and even the false rate of acceptance are low by using this method.

abstract={Background: X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS) is a vitreoretinal degenerative disorder causing vision deterioration, due to structural defects in retina. The hallmark of this disease includes radial streaks arising from the fovea and splitting of inner retinal layers (schisis). Although these retinal changes are attributed to mutations in the retinoschisin gene, schisis is also observed in patients who do not carry mutations. In addition, the origin of intraschisis fluid, the triggering point of schisis formation and its progression are largely unknown still. So far, there is no report on the complete proteomic analysis of this fluid. Schisis fluid proteome could reflect biochemical changes in the disease condition, helping in better understanding and management of retinoschisis. Therefore it was of interest to investigate the intraschisis fluid proteome using high-resolution mass spectrometry. Methods: Two male XLRS patients (aged 4 and 40 years) underwent clinical and genetic evaluation followed by surgical extraction of intraschisis fluids. The two fluid samples were resolved on a SDS-PAGE and the processed peptides were analyzed by Q-Exactive plus hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometry. Functional annotation of the identified proteins was performed using Ingenuity pathway analysis software. Results: Mass spectrometry analysis detected 770 nonredundant proteins in the intraschisis fluid. Retinol dehydrogenase 14 was found to be abundant in the schisis fluid. Gene ontology based analysis indicated that 19% of the intraschisis fluid proteins were localized to the extracellular matrix and 15% of the proteins were involved in signal transduction. Functional annotation identified three primary canonical pathways to be associated with the schisis fluid proteome viz., LXR/RXR activation, complement system and acute phase response signalling, which are involved in immune and inflammatory responses. Collectively, our results show that intraschisis fluid comprises specific inflammatory proteins which highly reflect the disease environment. Conclusion: Based on our study, it is suggested that inflammation might play a key role in the pathogenesis of XLRS. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the complete proteome of intraschisis fluid, which could serve as a template for future research and facilitate the development of therapeutic modalities for XLRS. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={Proteolytic Aeromonas caviae P-1-1 growing at wide-ranging pH (7.0–11.0) and moderate salinity (0–5% NaCl) was isolated from cattle shed of Thanjavur, India. It produced lipase, gelatinase, and polyhydroxybutyrate. Different culture conditions, incubation time, carbon and nitrogen sources, vitamins, amino acids, surfactants, and metal ions for optimal growth and protease production of P-1-1 were examined. Maximum protease (0.128 U/mL) production was achieved with 1% fructose, 1% yeast extract, 0.1% ammonium sulfate, 3% NaCl, 0.1% CaCl2 · 2H2O, 1% glycine, 0.1% vitamin E, and 0.1% Tween-40 at pH 8.0 after 42 hr of incubation at 37°C. It was active over broad range of pH (7.0–12.0), temperature (15–100°C), and salinity (0–9% NaCl) with optima at pH 10.0, 55°C, and 3% NaCl. It retained 65 and 48% activities at pH 12.0 and 100°C, respectively. Partially purified protease was highly stable (100%) within pH range 7.0–12.0 and salinities of 0–5% NaCl for 48 hr. Cu2+, Mn2+, Co2+, and Ca2+ did not inhibit its activity. Its stability at extreme pHs, temperatures, and in the presence of surfactants and commercial detergents suggests its possible application in laundry detergents. Partially purified protease was immobilized and reused.

abstract={In the present study, two molecular complexes of 2,6-DHB with pharmaceutically active nutraceuticals i.e. nicotinic acid (NA) and nicotinamide (NIC) have been synthesized and preliminarily characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and FT-IR spectroscopy. Finally the crystal structures were solved by single crystal X-ray diffraction and the structures were analyzed in terms of supramolecular interactions. The salt 1 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group Cc, with a = 10.1503(1) Å, b = 12.3821(1) Å, c = 9.5291(1) Å, β = 94.343(1)°, V = 1194.20(2) Å3, Z = 4.

The molecular packing of both salts are stabilized by N+–H⋯O−, O–H⋯O−, N–H⋯O and O–H⋯O hydrogen bonding interactions. DFT calculations substantiate the features of crystal structures. The Hirshfeld surfaces and the associated 2D fingerprint plots were investigated which revealed that more than two-third of close contacts were associated with relatively weak H⋯H, C⋯H and H⋯C interactions. The use of 3-D Hirshfeld surfaces in combination with 2-D fingerprint plots revealed that these weak interactions play major role in molecular crystal packing. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The emergence and spread of multi-drug resistant (MDR) especially carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae is a major emerging threat to public health, leading to excess in mortality rate as high as 50-86%. MDR K. pneumoniae manifests all broad mechanisms of drug resistance, hence development of new drugs to treat MDR K. pneumoniae infection has become a more relevant question in the scientific community. In the present study a potential Streptomyces sp. ASK2 was isolated from rhizosphere soil of medicinal plant. The multistep HPLC purification identified the active principle exhibiting antagonistic activity against MDR K. pneumoniae. The purified compound was found to be an aromatic compound with aliphatic side chain molecule having a molecular weight of 444.43 Da. FT-IR showed the presence of OH and C=O as functional groups. The bioactive compound was further evaluated for drug induced toxicity and efficacy in adult zebrafish infection model. As this is the first study on K. pneumoniae - zebrafish model, the infectious doses to manifest sub-clinical and clinical infection were optimized. Furthermore, the virulence of K. pneumoniae in planktonic and biofilm state was studied in zebrafish. The MTT assay of ex vivo culture of zebrafish liver reveals non-toxic nature of the proposed ASK2 compound at an effective dose. Moreover, significant increase in survival rate of infected zebrafish suggests that ASK2 compound from a new strain of Streptomyces sp. was potent in mitigating MDR K. pneumoniae infection. © 2017 Cheepurupalli, Raman, Rathore and Ramakrishnan.},

abstract={There is evidence that certain club cells (CCs) in the murine airways associated with neuroepithelial bodies (NEBs) and terminal bronchioles are resistant to the xenobiotic naphthalene (Nap) and repopulate the airways after Nap injury. The identity and significance of these progenitors (variant CCs, v-CCs) have remained elusive. A recent screen for CC markers identified rare Uroplakin3a (Upk3a)-expressing cells (U-CCs) with a v-CC-like distribution. Here, we employ lineage analysis in the uninjured and chemically injured lungs to investigate the role of U-CCs as epithelial progenitors. U-CCs proliferate and generate CCs and ciliated cells in uninjured airways long-term and, like v-CCs, after Nap. U-CCs have a higher propensity to generate ciliated cells than non-U-CCs. Although U-CCs do not contribute to alveolar maintenance long-term, they generate alveolar type I and type II cells after Bleomycin (Bleo)-induced alveolar injury. Finally, we report that Upk3a+ cells exist in the NEB microenvironment of the human lung and are aberrantly expanded in conditions associated with neuroendocrine hyperplasias. © 2017 The Authors},

abstract={Incidence of disease in horticultural crops is one of the important problems affecting the production of fruits, vegetables and flowers. Regular monitoring of crops for early diagnosis and treatment with pesticides or removal of the affected crop is some of the solution to minimize the crop loss. Monitoring of the crops by human labour is costly, time consuming, error prone due to insufficient knowledge of the disease and highly repetitive at different stages of crop growth. These needs have motivated to design a line following mobile robot with vision sensors for navigation across the field for disease identification in a green house. The robot has been designed and simulated in an open source software known as Virtual Robot Experimental Platform (V-REP) with experimental field of 40 crops. Programming for navigation is done in Lua scripting tool which is embedded with the V-REP software. Capturing of images has been performed using camera. Processing of images for identification of disease and its representation in a Graphical User Interface (GUI) has been done using an algorithm in MATLAB R2011B which interacts with V-REP tool through socket communication. Texture based analysis has been done to identify the diseased crops among the healthy crops in the simulated field setup. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Spider robot is an eight legged mechanical vehicle that walks in space. Three or more legs of spider robot can be used for making the robot statically stable. The rest of the legs can be used to reach a new position or to operate a payload. The robot may move even if one or two legs become disabled. The objective of this paper is to model and simulate eight legged walking spider robot. This robot uses an eccentric cylindrical cam mechanism. The specialty of this mechanism is that it uses only two actuators to make the robot walk and even turn. Pro ENGINEER software is used for modeling of the spider robot and ADAMS software is used for simulation of the mechanism. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={There has been a growing demand for finding credible technological means to help children with Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD), a disability that causes children to have difficulties with social interaction, communication, cognitive skills and psychomotor skills. The clinical application for using robotics to further emphasize behavioural change in children with ASD has always been deliberated. This work proposes the use of a mechatronic training kit to impart psychomotor skills by addressing a specific daily life task. The objective is to enhance the psychomotor skills like pincer grasp, hand-eye coordination and bilateral coordination among children with ASD by training the children to wear the left and right shoes correctly. The results of this study show the usefulness of the mechatronic training kit in training the child to perform the task. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Patients with hemiparesis have difficulties maintaining their balance. These skills can be regained with the aid of external motors and using a microcontroller to control the actuation of the motors. A biped robot with servo motors attached at each joint is fabricated. A clay model of the paralytic leg is made and attached to the hip of the body and the other leg of the biped is modelled as a 3-DOF RRR robot. A CAD model of the prototype was considered for verifying the control strategies. The control strategies include COP (Centre of Pressure) balancing, CMP (Centre of Mass) balancing and stepping sequence (change of support) during the motion of the biped. The control system analysis is performed by analyzing the swing vibration of the leg and root locus plot for checking stability. The stability control is enhanced by taking feedback from gyroscope sensor. A graphical interface is made my using python for analyzing the values from gyroscope and accelerometer sensor. These values are plotted for analyzing the dynamic stability of the body. The joint velocities, acceleration and torque values are analyzed. The setup is simulated in v-rap software. After the analysis, the limiting joint angles were found. The servo motors are actuated to the limiting angles if the body becomes unstable, the biped robot is programmed in a way that it is always stable. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={This investigation presents an adaptive simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system using sensor fusion based on confidence weighted average technique. The confidence weights for the sensor data are adapted based on instantaneous sensor accuracy evaluated during robot navigation. To this extent, a performance metric called the map spread factor is formulated which is based on the mismatch between the past and present map retranslated using sensor measurements on robot location. As this metric evaluates the sensor performance without any prior knowledge of its characteristics based on the maps acquired from the scanner the method is independent of the type of sensor employed. Our experiments demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed approach over traditional extended Kalman filter based SLAM. © 2016 IEEE.},

In the crystal, molecules form as a dimer through a keto-enol type hydrogen-bonding pattern along with intermolecular C[sbnd]H⋯O interactions. The crystal structure of the title compound is further stabilized by intermolecular H⋯H interactions. Various intermolecular interactions present in the crystal structure are quantified by Hirshfeld surface analysis, PIXEL energy, NBO, AIM and DFT calculations. The energetics of the title compound is also compared with that of the two closely related analogs. Further, the vibrational modes of the interacting groups are characterized using both the experimental and simulated FT-IR and FT-Raman spectra. The experimental and calculated UV–visible spectra are compared and agree well. The time-dependent DFT spectra suggest that the ligand-to-ligand charge transfer within the molecule is responsible for the intense absorbance. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Spontaneous symmetry breaking is an important phenomenon observed in various fields including physics and biology. In this connection, we here show that the trade-off between attractive and repulsive couplings can induce spontaneous symmetry breaking in a homogeneous system of coupled oscillators. With a simple model of a system of two coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators, we demonstrate how the tendency of attractive coupling in inducing in-phase synchronized (IPS) oscillations and the tendency of repulsive coupling in inducing out-of-phase synchronized oscillations compete with each other and give rise to symmetry breaking oscillatory states and interesting multistabilities. Further, we provide explicit expressions for synchronized and antisynchronized oscillatory states as well as the so called oscillation death (OD) state and study their stability. If the Hopf bifurcation parameter (λ) is greater than the natural frequency (ω) of the system, the attractive coupling favors the emergence of an antisymmetric OD state via a Hopf bifurcation whereas the repulsive coupling favors the emergence of a similar state through a saddle-node bifurcation. We show that an increase in the repulsive coupling not only destabilizes the IPS state but also facilitates the reentrance of the IPS state. © 2017 American Physical Society.},

The optimal plan parameters of the proposed plan, such as the sample size, the acceptance and rejection numbers, and the number of successive (preceding) lots needed for making the decision whether to accept or reject the current lot, are determined using the approach of two points on the operating characteristic curve. Tables are constructed for different combinations of producer's and consumer's risks. The implementation of the proposed plan is also explained with a descriptive example. Comparison is also made with the existing sampling plans. In addition, an economic design of the proposed plan is also discussed and the optimal plans are determined, such that both producer's and consumer's risks are satisfied with minimum total cost of inspection. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Insulation diagnostics has been accepted and applied as a tool for condition assessment of high voltage equipment to identify the weak spots of the insulation. Partial discharge (PD) signal features indicate insulation condition of the equipment effectively. Extracting PD signal is one of the major tasks in PD measurement system. PD signals are characterized by a high-frequency current pulse from the noisy background. Noise detection and removal pose considerable challenges due to unknown sources that cause noise distribution. A Recent literature survey indicates there are only a few methods to detect a few of noises types. Though wavelet threshold function and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) technique evolved as noise detection tools not much work related to the design of robust techniques which will lead to a simultaneous reduction of types of noise has been reported to literature. This paper proposes a novel hybrid structure that combines wavelet threshold function and EMD technique, which has been applied to both numerically simulated PD pulses and later to the observed data from the laboratory. Quality metrics Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), Cross-Correlation (CC), Mean Square Error (MSE) and Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) are used to compare the results. The obtained result indicates the superior performance of proposed hybrid technique in denoising white noise pulses from the PD signatures. The average PSNR value of proposed hybrid technique for removal of white noises has been found to be more than the PSNR values of traditional methods. By fitting statistical distribution, the noise separated from the PD has been proven to be white noise. © 2006-2017 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN). All rights reserved.},

abstract={One of the main causes of blindness is diabetic retinopathy (DR) and it may affect people of any ages. In these days, both young and old ages are affected by diabetes, and the diabetes is the main cause of DR. Hence, it is necessary to have an automated system with good accuracy and less computation time to diagnose and treat DR, and the automated system can simplify the work of ophthalmologists. The objective is to present an overview of various works recently in detecting and segmenting the various lesions of DR. Papers were categorized based on the diagnosing tools and the methods used for detecting early and advanced stage lesions. The early lesions of DR are microaneurysms, hemorrhages, exudates, and cotton wool spots and in the advanced stage, new and fragile blood vessels can be grown. Results have been evaluated in terms of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and receiver operating characteristic curve. This paper analyzed the various steps and different algorithms used recently for the detection and classification of DR lesions. A comparison of performances has been made in terms of sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve, and accuracy. Suggestions, future work and the area to be improved were also discussed. © 2017 The Authors.},

abstract={The present work briefs the extraction of different kinds of nutraceutical plant molecules from different plants for the first time by using the remarkable extraction ability of a safe, "green" solvent: alkaline sucrose. The developed process was initially applied to isolate β,β-dimethylacryl shikonin (BDMS) and ursolic acid (UA) from Arnebia nobilis and Cotoneaster buxifolia, respectively. The extractive efficiency was determined by HPLC-DAD analysis. The versatility of the alkaline sucrose as extractive solvent was later confirmed by isolating four more different molecules from their respective plant matrices with significant recovery and purity. Further optimization by Box-Behnken experimental design model yielded a maximized amount of BDMS (18.2 mg/g of DM) and UA (2.2 mg/g of DM) with a high correlation coefficient (0.98-0.99), demonstrating a good fit between the regression model (second order) and the experimental results. The final purity of compounds through optimized process was greater than 90% (e.g. BDMS: 93%, UA: 96%, etc.). The optimized yields signify remarkable increase in final yield of compounds (e.g. BDMS: 152%, UA: 200%, etc.) than conventional solvent-based plant compound extraction, thus making the developed process a benign, green route for rapid isolation of plant compounds. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2017.},

abstract={Landslide is the most common natural disaster in mountainous regions. It causes damages to life and properties. The study area, Calicut–Nilampur–Gudalurghat section (SH37) falls under the Survey of India toposheet 58A-7/NE (1:25,000). The present study was carried out with landslide hazard zonation mapping on meso-scale. This paper explains how meso-zonation of landslide hazards (facet-wise) was made from investigations as per the norms given in Bureau of Indian Standard IS 14496:1998. Remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) was utilized for the preparation of thematic maps on 1:10,000 scale. The present study evaluates more detailed related factors of inherent causative factors (lithology, structure, slope gradient, relative relief, land use/land cover, and hydrogeology) involved in landslides. This method also incorporates effects of external causative factors like seismicity and rainfall as corrected rating. In the study area, 10 different facets have been identified. This area falling in facets 3, 4, 6, 7, and 10 come under high hazardous zone, the slopes falling in the facets 1 and 5 fall in the moderate hazardous zone, facet 2 in low hazard zone and other facets 8 and 9 show very high hazardous zone. Details of this work are presented in this paper. The landslide inventory points were collected with the help GPS in this ghat section. The inventory percentage 3.3% comes in low hazard zone, 18% present in moderate hazard zone, 57.4% in high hazard zone, and 21.3% under very high hazard zone. © 2017, Saudi Society for Geosciences.},

The adsorption property of ethanol on borophene nanosheet is investigated in terms of average energy gap variation, adsorption energy and Mulliken charge transfer. The variation in the density of states and energy band structure of ethanol adsorbed borophene nanosheet compared with its isolated borophene nanosheet clearly confirms the adsorption of ethanol molecule. The device density of states spectrum explains the variation in peak maxima owing to transfer of electrons between ethanol molecules and borophene base material. I-V characteristics support the variation in the current upon adsorption of ethanol molecules on the borophene molecular device. In order to verify the selectivity of ethanol molecules along borophene device in the ambient condition, the adsorption property of O2 is also studied. The findings confirm that borophene nanosheet can be used as an ethanol sensor. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

ATS in consistency with OXP was found to reverse TRAIL resistant HepG2 cells towards TRAIL mediated apoptosis by enhancing caspase-3 and cleavage of PARP. Additionally, ATS also suppressed the nuclear translocation of activated signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) thereby sensitizing the HepG2 cells towards only death receptor 4 (DR4) mediated apoptosis. Furthermore, ATS exposure in TRAIL resistant cells resulted in significant increase of both DR4/DR5 expression and STAT3 inhibition thereby arbitrating TRAIL mediated apoptosis in HepG2 cells. The increase in expression was comparable to that of STAT3 silenced cells. From all the above observations, we conclude that ATS up-regulated DR4 expression by targeting STAT3, which in turn sensitized HepG2 cells to TRAIL mediated apoptosis. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS},

abstract={Methylglyoxal (MG), a metabolic intermediate of glycolysis is a precursor for endogeneous production of advanced glycation end-products. The increased production of MG have negative influence over the structure and function of different biomolecules and thus plays an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiac complications. Retinoic acid (RA), an active metabolite of vitamin A, has a major role in preventing cardiac remodeling and ventricular fibrosis. Hence, the objective of the present study was to determine whether rats administered with all-trans retinoic acid (RA) could attenuate MG induced pathological effects. Wistar rats were divided into 4 groups. Group 1 rats were kept as control; Group 2 rats were administrated with MG (75 mg/kg/day) for 8 weeks. Group 3 rats were given RA (Orally, 1.0 mg/kg/day) along with MG; Group 4 rats received RA alone. Cardiac antioxidant status, induction of fibrosis, AGE receptor (RAGE) and cytokines expression was evaluated in the heart tissues. Administration of MG led to depletion of antioxidant enzymes, induction of fibrosis (p < 0.001), up-regulated expression of RAGE (3.5 fold), TGF-β (4.4 fold), SMAD2 (3.7 fold), SMAD3 (6.0 fold), IL-6 (4.3 fold) and TNF-α (5.5 fold) in the heart tissues compared to control rats. Moreover, the exogenous administration of MG caused significant (p < 0.001) increase in the circulating CML levels. Whereas, RA treatment prevented the induction of fibrosis and restored the levels of cytokines and RAGE expression. Methylglyoxal-induced fibrosis can lead to pathological effects in the heart tissues. RA attenuates the effects of MG in the heart, suggesting that it can be of added value to usual diabetic therapy. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

As-synthesized PANI was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy and surface area analysis. X-ray diffraction and FTIR spectroscopic studies confirmed the formation of PANI. Microscopic studies revealed that the morphology of PANI is spherical brushes comprising of straight and radially grown nanorods of different lengths. Capacitive storage performance of PANI was studied in a mixed perchlorate electrolyte consisting of HClO4 and NaClO4. A specific capacitance of 394 F g−1 with good rate capability was obtained for nanorod assembly of PANI. The improved storage performance of PANI is attributed to its morphology, which provides easy access to the electrolyte and short diffusion path length for ions. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Zinc oxide (ZnO) thin films have been deposited onto thoroughly cleaned stainless steel (AISI SS 304) substrates by reactive direct current (dc) magnetron sputtering and the films were doped with silver (Ag). The prepared thin films were analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) to investigate the structural and morphological properties. The thickness values of the films were in the range of 194 to 256nm. XRD results revealed that the films were crystalline with preferred (002) orientation. Grain size values of pure ZnO films were found to be 19.82-23.72nm. On introducing Ag into ZnO film, the micro-structural properties varied. Adhesion test was carried out with Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) in order to know the adherence property of the deposited films. Colony formation units (CFU) were counted manually and bacterial adhesion inhibition (BAI) was calculated. We observed a decrease in the CFU on doping Ag in the ZnO films. BAI of the film deposited at - 100 V substrate bias was found to be increased on Ag doping from 69 to 88%. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={The synthesis of strong electron-withdrawing group substituted aromatic amine and phenol-based benzoxazines is hampered due to the poor solubility of the reactant. In this article, a simple methodology is presented to synthesize the strong electron-withdrawing groups substituted benzoxazine monomers from a solution method using a low-boiling polar solvent. In order to achieve this, we used formaldehyde as a reactant as well as a solvent, and the reaction was carried out for a longer time. Also, benzylaniline derivatives were successfully prepared through benzoxazine. The monomers were polymerized by using solution polymerization method using lithium bromide as a catalyst. The structure of the monomers and polymers was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The thermally activated polymerization of the monomers was evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry, and thermal properties of polymers were analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis. © 2016 The Author(s).},

abstract={This research primarily focuses on improving the strength of Al 5083 alloy by both the ECAP and Cryo ECAP methodology. Equal Channel Angular Pressing (ECAP) is one of the best technologies that enable the direct transformation of conventional macro grained metals into sub-micron, ultra-fine and nano grained materials. Fine grain size increases the strength and the fracture toughness of the material and provides the potential for super plastic deformation at moderate temperatures and at high strain rates. The microstructure evolution in Al 5083, subjected to Room Temperature ECAP and Cryo ECAP were analysed. ECAP was carried out using an optimized die with Channel angle ‘ϕ’ = 90°and corner angle ‘Ψ’ = 20° through processing route A and C up to four passes. The results were thoroughly studied using TEM, SEM, and optical microscopic images. Initially the annealed sample had the grain size of 80 µm with the equi-axed grains. In Room Temperature, the hardness values and the mechanical strength were found to be increased from 88 to 410 HV and 306 to 453 MPa after four passes in route A and in route C the strength increased from 390 to 416 MPa after four ECAP passes. Moreover, in Cryo Condition, the sample was processed up to four ECAP passes at route A and route C. The hardness of 153 HV was obtained after four passes in route C and 164 HV obtained after four passes on route A. Additionally, fracture behaviour using SEM, grain size using TEM and crystallite size by X-ray diffraction studies were analyzed. It was observed that the Cryo ECAP showed marginal improvements in mechanical properties relative to the RT ECAP in case of Al 5083. © 2017, The Indian Institute of Metals - IIM.},

abstract={Magnetically impelled arc butt welding (MIAB) is said to be a hybrid solid-state welding technique which is mainly preferred for butt welding of hollow cylindrical parts such as pipes and tubes. The MIAB setup is robust and fairly simple in design, and requires low upset pressure than the methods like Friction welding. This study investigates the effect of MIAB welding parameters on T91 steel tubes and the experimental observations on the welded joints. The input parameters considered in the present work are welding current (900, 1000, 1100 A), tube thickness (3.5, 4.5, 5.5 mm) and weld time (6, 9, 12 s). The tensile strength and hardness measurements have been recorded and the cross sectional micro and macro images have been observed for the welded samples. Further, the welded specimens have undergone computed tomography and radiography tests. It is concluded from the study that MIAB is one of the feasible welding techniques for joining steel tubes. However, the result shows crack in the weld zone for selected parameters. This defect may be avoided by selecting the optimum welding parameters. © 2017, The Indian Institute of Metals - IIM.},

abstract={In this paper the Speech-to-Speech Translation (SST) system, which is mainly focused on translation from English to Dravidian languages (Tamil and Malayalam) has been proposed. Three major techniques involved in SST system are Automatic continuous speech recognition, machine translation, and text-to-speech synthesis system. In this paper automatic Continuous Speech Recognition (CSR) has been developed based on the Auto Associative Neural Network (AANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The HMM yields better results compared with SVM and AANN. Hence the HMM based Speech recognizer for English language has been taken. We propose a hybrid Machine Translation (MT) system (combination of Rule based and Statistical) for converting English to Dravidian languages text. A syllable based concatenative Text To Speech Synthesis (TTS) for Tamil and Malayalam has been proposed. AANN based prosody prediction has been done for the Tamil language which is used to improve the naturalness and intelligibility. The domain is restricted to sentences that cover the announcements in the railway station, bus stop and airport. This work is framed a novel translation method for English to Dravidian languages. The improved performance of each module HMM based CSR, Hybrid MT and concatenative TTS increases the overall speech translation performance. This proposed speech translation system can be applied to English to any Indian languages if we train and create a parallel corpus for those languages. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={In the present study, cut slope stability assessment along ghat road section of Kolli hills was carried out by using various geotechnical parameters of rock and soil slope sections and structural kinematics of major discontinuities is presented. The rock slope (RS) stability assessment was carried out using Rock Mass Rating basic (RMRbasic) and Slope Mass Rating (SMR) classification systems. The type of failure and their Factor of Safety (FOS) for individual RS was calculated using Hoek and Bray method. In the case of soil slopes (SS), the FOS was calculated using Circular Failure Chart (CFC) and Limit Equilibrium (LE) methods. The input data for the slope stability analyses were collected through extensive field work followed by stereonet plotting and laboratory test. There are six rock slope sections, and five soil slope sections were taken into consideration for the cut slope stability analyses. The area depicts class II (RS-1, 2, &amp; 6) and class III (RS-3, 4, &amp; 5) of RMR classes. The SMR result depicts for RS-1, RS-2, and RS-6 are 64.40, 60.02, and 60.70, respectively, and falls in class II stable condition. The SMR values of RS-3 and RS-5 were 44.33 and 57, respectively, and come under the class III partially stable condition. The RS-4 with SMR value of 17.33 falls under the class I completely unstable condition. The FOS of planar failure case indicates that RS-3 (FOS = 0.22) is more unstable, while all other sections are having greater than 1 FOS. The calculated FOS values using CFC method reveals that the FOS is very close to 1 for all the SS sections that fall under completely saturated condition which indicates that these slope sections may fail during heavy rainfall. In LE method, the sections SS-3 and SS-4 are unsafe under partially and completely saturated (natural slope) condition. In average slope condition, all the SS sections are unsafe under partially or completely saturated conditions. The facets 2, 3, 4, and 5 required mitigation measures, to improve the stability of slopes. Site-specific mitigation measures were suggested for partially or completely unstable rock and soil cut slopes. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={Concurrent tolerancing becomes an optimisation problem to find out the optimum allocation of the process tolerances in the given design function constraints. In traditional optimisation methods, finding out the optimum solution for this advanced tolerance design problem is complex. The proposed algorithms (elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm) and differential evolution extensively do better than the previous algorithms for attaining the optimum result. The aim of this paper is to suggest a model for optimal tolerance allocation by considering both tolerance cost and the present worth of quality loss such that the total manufacturing cost/loss is minimised. The suggested model takes into account the time value of money for quality loss and product degradation over time and consists of two new parameters: the planning horizon and the product user’s discount rate. From the outcome of this study, a longer planning horizon results in an increase in both tolerance cost and quality loss; however, a larger value of discount rate gives up a decrease in both tolerance cost and quality loss. Finally, a practical example is brought into reveal the effectiveness of the suggested method. © 2016, Springer-Verlag London.},

abstract={The green synthesis and characterization of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) derived from plants impart ecological and economic benefits to AgNPs. In addition, AgNPs have potential therapeutic roles in cytoprotectivity and anti-inflammation. The present work utilizes the aqueous extract of Phyllanthus acidus fruits for the production of AgNPs from aqueous silver nitrate solution. The synthesized AgNPs were characterized spectrophotometrically Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy analysis. The characterized AgNPs showed potent anti-inflammatory activity by scavenging nitric oxide and superoxide anions. In addition, blunting of the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) assayed both by ELISA and Western blot, using H2O2 – induced inflammation in rat peritoneal macrophages. Furthermore, short-term exposure to P. acidus-mediated green-synthesized AgNPs did not affect the viability of peritoneal macrophages, as assessed by MTT assay. Our findings indicate that P. acidus-mediated green-synthesized AgNPs could be a potential therapeutics to treat inflammatory diseases. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={We investigate the dynamics of a coupled waveguide system with competing linear and nonlinear loss-gain profiles which can facilitate power saturation. We show the usefulness of the model in achieving unidirectional beam propagation. In this regard, the considered type of coupled waveguide system has two drawbacks: (i) difficulty in achieving perfect isolation of light in a waveguide and (ii) existence of blow-up-type behavior for certain input power situations. We here show a nonlinear PT-symmetric coupling that helps to overcome these two drawbacks. Such a nonlinear coupling has close connection with the phenomenon of stimulated Raman scattering. In particular, we have elucidated the role of this nonlinear coupling using an integrable PT-symmetric situation. In particular, using the integrals of motion, we have reduced this coupled waveguide problem to the problem of dynamics of a particle in a potential. With the latter picture, we have clearly illustrated the role of the considered nonlinear coupling. The above PT-symmetric case corresponds to a limiting form of a general equation describing the phenomenon of stimulated Raman scattering. We also point out the ability to transport light unidirectionally even in this general case. © 2017 American Physical Society.},

We determined the sensitivity of the MG1655 and Δ10 strains to various antibiotics by disk diffusion method, as it is highly sensitive and quantifiable. We observed that the zone of inhibition of MG1655 with ciprofloxacin (10 μg) was 3 cm (averages) while that of Δ10 strain was 3.6 cm (Figure 3B). With ampicillin (10 μg), the zones of inhibition for MG1655 and Δ10 strain were 2.1 cm and 2.45 cm, respectively. With nalidixic acid, the zones of inhibition for MG1655 and Δ10 strain were 1.78 and 1.98 cm, respectively.

abstract={Centratherum punctatum Cass., a herb belonging to the family Asteraceae has been traditionally used as a curative against diverse disorders like inflammation, tumor, depression, and hypertension. Though the medicinal properties of this plant have been attributed to the presence of flavonoids, glucosides, alkaloids, Vitamin C, etc., the molecular constituents of this plant and of the flavonoids that contribute to its medicinal activity have not been explored yet. This work attempts to evaluate the potential of Centratherum punctatum extract as an anti-inflammatory agent. Ethanolic extracts of Centratherum punctatum analyzed by High Performance Thin Layer Chromatography (HPTLC) and Liquid Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) identified the presence of the flavones kaempferol, glycoside Isorhamnetin-3-O-rutinoside, and kaempferol-3-glucoside. The plant extract exhibited anti-oxidant property as confirmed by DPPH assay and IC50 value of 271.6 μg/mL during inhibition of protein denaturation, 186.8 μg/mL during RBC membrane stabilization, and 278.2 μg/mL for proteinase inhibition. Membrane stabilizing functions of flavones and flavones glycosides validated the anti-inflammatory potential of the extract. In silico evaluation using a rigorous molecular docking protocol with receptors of Cox2, TNF-α, Interleukin 1β convertase, and Histamine H1 predicted high binding affinity of the isoflavones and isoflavone glycosides of Centratherum punctatum Cass. The interactions have also been shown to compare well with that of known drugs valdecoxib through Gln178, His342, and Gly340, desloratadine (through Lys191 and Thr194) and belnacasin (through Asp288 and Gly287) proven to function through the anti-inflammatory pathway. This work establishes the anti-inflammatory potential of Centratherum punctatum Cass. extract as an alternative to existing therapeutic approach to inflammation through a systematic in silico approach supplementing the findings. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Ethnobotanical relevance Pogostemon elsholtzioides Benth. (Lamiaceae) is an aromatic shrub, endemic to eastern Himalaya region. The leaves are used for treating goiter and high blood pressure (BP) by indigenous people in Arunachal Pradesh, India. Young leaves are used as vegetable and leaf decoction is also used for cough, cold and headache by some indigenous communities in Northeast India. Aim of the study This species is used for treating hypertension and the genus Pogostemon is rich in essential oil. Therefore, the present study was aimed at investigation of the chemical constituents, vasorelaxant and cardiovascular effects of the essential oil of P. elsholtzioides. Materials and methods P. elsholtzioides was collected from Pasighat, Arunachal Pradesh, India and essential oil was extracted from shade dried leaves. Essential oil was analyzed by GC-FID and GC-MS and the volatile constituents were identified. Vasorelaxant and cardiovascular properties of the essential oil were studied against phenylephrine induced contraction in isolated endothelium intact aortic preparations and by measuring systolic and diastolic BP, mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) after carotid artery cannulation in Wistar rats. Results The essential oil was rich in sesquiterpenes and curzerene, benzophenone, α-cadinol and germacrone were major constituents. The essential oil exhibited significant vasodilation effect in phenylephrine induced contracted aortic rings. Vasorelaxant effect of the essential oil was also observed both in the presence and absence of Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester against phenylephrine-contracted aortic rings. It also induced reduction of systolic and diastolic BP, MAP and HR. Conclusions Essential oil of P. elsholtzioides exhibited significant vasorelaxant effect against endothelium intact aortic preparation mediated through nitric oxide dependent pathway and also reduced BP. However, further study is needed to screen the role of calcium ions in both intracellular and extracellular pathway. © 2017 Elsevier Ireland Ltd},

abstract={Two-phase flow measurement is important in process and chemical industries. In the present work, a measurement technique for the characterization of two-phase flows using a laser and an arrangement of the photodiodes is proposed and tested. Two-phase flow experiments were carried out in 1.80, 3.14, and 4.68-mm-diameter glass tubes. A high-speed camera was used to analyze the various optical patterns formed by a stationary laser beam on a screen during bubbly, slug, and stratified flows, which have been discussed in detail in Navisa et al. (2015). Photodiodes are arranged on the screen based on high-speed camera recordings. A procedure is demonstrated to calculate the flow regime velocity and length based on the photodiode outputs. The designed nonintrusive instrumentation determines the two-phase flow parameters in real time for flow in optically transparent mini channels. The accuracy of the measurement technique and the limitations are also discussed. © 2017, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={This paper proposes a variables quick switching system where the quality characteristic of interest follows a normal distribution and the quality characteristic is evaluated through a process loss function. Most of the variables sampling plans available in the literature focus only on the fraction non-conforming and those plans do not distinguish between the products that fall within the specification limits. The products that fall within specification limits may not be good if their mean is too away from the target value. So developing a sampling plan by considering process loss is inevitable in these situations. Based on this idea, we develop a variables quick switching system based on the process loss function for the application of the processes requiring low process loss. Tables are also constructed for the selection of parameters of variables quick switching system for given acceptable quality level and limiting quality level. The results are explained with examples. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={In parallel computing and computer networks, several different topologies for interconnecting processing vertices exist. It is quite an enormous task to compare such networks with reference to attributes such as diameter, average distance, traffic balance, fault tolerance, etc. In order to overcome the inherent drawbacks in ring topology, it is suggested to have a P-vertex ring that could lead to a double ring network. These notions have led to the generalised Petersen graph. Let p≥3 be a positive integer and let k ϵ{1,2,… p-1}\⌊p/2⌋. The generalized petersen graph GP((p, k) has its vertex and edge set as V(GP(p,k))={u_(i):i ϵZp }∪{u_i^’∶iϵZp} E(GP(p,k))={u_(i) u_(i+1):iϵZp }∪{u_i^’ u_(i+k)^’∶i ϵZp} ∪{u_(i) u_i^’:i ϵ Zp}. They form a pertinent family of 3-connected, 3-regular graphs with 2p vertices and 3p edges. These graphs are generally used in interconnection networks. The Petersen Graph is definitely a sought after objects among the graph theory community. It has served as a counter example to several open problems and conjectures. Even though it is cubic and without cut edges is not 1-factorizable and non-hamiltonian. Another surprising aspect is that it is highly symmetric even though its automorphism graph on directed paths of length three is transitive. In this paper, we probe its spectrum and determine its Estrada index, Laplacian Estrada index, signless Laplacian Estrada index, normalized Laplacian Estrada index and energy of a graph. While obtaining some interesting results, we also provide relevant background and problems. © Rushing Water Publishers Ltd., Philippines 2017.},

abstract={We report for the first time a cyclic voltammetric nitrate sensor with a low detection limit based on the immobilization of zinc oxide nanoparticles on the surface of the platinum working electrode using chitosan membrane. Cyclic voltammetric data demonstrated that zinc oxide nanoparticles can electrochemically reduce nitrate ions to ammonium ions with high conductivity. In order to estimate electroanalytical parameters for each of the nitrate concentrations, Gaussian and Lorentzian curve fitting algorithms were performed on cyclic voltammetric data. Among them, the best analytical performance results were obtained with Gaussian calibration linear model. The zinc oxide modified platinum electrode showed a linear response to nitrate ions over a concentration range from 0.1 to 2.0 mM with a low detection limit and high sensitivity of 10 nM and 39.91 μA/cm2 mM, respectively. The nitrate ion concentrations in drinking water samples were determined using Gaussian calibration linear model and the predicted, added nitrate ion concentration values showed good correlation. © 2017, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

abstract={Mini aerial vehicles have gained a lot of significance in the past five decades. The future defense strategies mainly rely upon mini aerial vehicles. In maneuvering a mini aerial vehicle, control of parameters like pitch angle, roll angle, side slip angle, etc., are very crucial and important. Due to geometry and weight constraints, controlling a mini aerial vehicle is very difficult. Mini aerial vehicles also gets easily disturbed from its path because of slight disturbance of wind. As weight constraint is imposed on mini aerial vehicle, low cost sensors are adopted. Low cost sensors gives noisy feedback, which still makes a challenging task to design a controller to track pitch angle for a mini aerial vehicle. The present work attempts to develop a flight simulator for Black Kite mini aerial vehicle and to design a proportional-integral controller to track pitch angle by taking feedback from an observer, which takes consideration of noisy sensor inputs. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.},

The parameters considered were different intensities of fire, load deflection behavior, spalling, crack pattern, stiffness, ductility and energy absorption. The three phases (300, 500 and 900 °C) of ISO834 fire curve were achieved in oil-burnt furnace of 250 kg capacity. The cooled beams were repaired for cracking and spalling and cured. The strengthening of repaired beams was achieved using glass fiber sheet with PP ECC (polypropylene engineered cementitious concrete) as binders. Numerical thermal stress analyses were carried out (ANSYS) for a thermal load of 300 °C. Data from flexure test showed that strengthening was effective for beam members affected by fire up to 500 °C, by shifting brittle shear failure to ductile flexural failure and improving the stiffness, energy absorption and ductility. Strengthening could not enhance the load deflection behavior and could not stop brittle shear failure if the fire loading in members exceeded 500 °C. Present technique could restore the strength and stiffness in members affected by medium fire intensity in an effective way, without carrying out any major repair for the damages. © Shiraz University 2016.},

abstract={Objective: The objective of the study was to determine the anticancer efficacy of Orthosiphon stamineus extract against Michigan Cancer Foundation-7 (MCF-7) and its phytochemical analysis through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Methods: Different solvents were used for leaf extraction and used for qualitative assay of phytochemicals using standard protocols. Different concentration (12.5, 25, 50, 100, and 200 µg/ml) of methanol extract and ethyl acetate extract of O. stamineus leaves were used to assess the in vitro cytotoxic effect using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Further, the ethyl acetate extract was subjected to GC-MS analysis, and the identification of components was based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology library database. Result: Of the hexane, methanol and ethyl acetate extracts, methanol extract found to contain more of phytochemicals followed by ethyl acetate. The inhibitory concentration 50 for methanol extract and ethyl acetate extract was found be 93.42 µg/ml and 215.3 µg/ml, respectively. GC-MS mass spectrum of ethyl acetate extract revealed the presence of squalene and phytol and antioxidants such as flavones. Sterols compounds such as vitamin E, ergosterol, cholesterol, and 3,7,11,15-tetramethyl-2-hexadecen-1-ol and terpenoids were also identified. Conclusion: The data obtained in this work could be useful as a chemical standard in checking the genuineness of this plant source. Data of the results further depicted that the selected traditional anti-cancer plants could be used not only as an anti-cancer but also as a good antioxidant. © 2017 The Authors.},

abstract={Stepped cascade aeration system is commonly used to aerate the water and wastewater to increase the dissolved oxygen during pre and post treatment process. In the present research, experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of a rectangular Cascade Aeration System with varying flow rates, risers and tread by maintaining constant width of the channel using water collected from reverse osmosis plant. The experiments were carried out with four different risers such as 0.15 m, 0.18 m, 0.225 m and 0.30 m. Each rise was investigated with five different tread of 0.60 m, 0.55 m, 0.50 m, 0.45 m and 0.40 m. Comprehensive experimental investigations were carried out for different hydraulic loading rates of 0.005 to 0.035 m3/s/m2. Results obtained from the experiments reveals that increasing dimensionless discharges promotes more aeration, attains a maximum up to dimensionless discharge= 2.22 and beyond this there was a significant decrease in aeration. In addition, the increased in number of steps significantly enhances air entertainment and surface fall rate in the Stepped Cascade Aeration System. A regression equation was derived by keeping aeration efficiency as response with dimensionless discharge and oxygen saturation concentration as influencing parameters. The dimension less discharge is a function of critical depth of the rectangular channel and step height, whereas oxygen saturation concentration represents the ratio of oxygen deficit and oxygen saturation concentration. Based on the experimental results, the optimum design and/or results such as number of steps (12 numbers) and hydraulic loading rate (0.025 m3/s/m2) with fixed tread width of 0.6 m were identified to achieve maximum aeration rate (0.5-0.60) in Aeration system. © School of Engineering, Taylor’s University.},

Experimental results reveal that, HPC with ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) (20%) and Quartz powder (10%) gave 68.4 MPa (for fck = 70 MPa) the maximum compressive strength among three different forms used. In terms of durability the same mix showed a reduction of 60% in voids compared to control concrete. The load carrying capacity of that mix was only 6% less than control concrete. Performance of HPC made with LWA and AEA was inferior to HPC with mineral admixture. Hence HPC with GGBFS (20%) and Quartz powder (10%) was an optimum mix among the various mixes used. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={A prolonged release drug delivery system was developed by loading Simvastatin-chitosan microparticles into poly vinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogels for enhanced wound healing efficiency. The microparticles prepared by ionic gelation method with varying composition of chitosan and surfactants (Tween 80/Pluronic F-127) were optimized for entrapment efficiency, morphology and drug-polymer interactions. Microparticles prepared with 0.3% between 80 and 0.5:5 chitosan: drug ratio showed maximum entrapment efficiency of 82% with spherical morphology and mild interaction between drug and chitosan. 5% PVA solutions loaded with pure drug and drug loaded microparticles at three different doses (2.5 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg equivalent of drug) were chemically cross linked using gluteraldehyde and HCl. The formulated hydrogels were optimized for swelling, in vitro release behavior and in vivo wound healing effect. Hydrogels containing 2.5 mg equivalent dose of Simvastatin microparticles exhibited maximum cumulative percentage drug release of 92% (n = 3) at the end of 7 days. The in vitro drug release data was supported by the higher swelling index of the low dose hydrogels. The in vivo wound healing study was performed using Wistar rats (n = 30, 5 groups with 6 animals in each group) for the formulated hydrogels (at 3 doses) and compared with the untreated animals and the positive control group treated with conventional topical Simvastatin ointment (1%). The wound healing effect was comparable to the in vitro results, wherein the animals treated with low dose hydrogels (replaced every 7 days) exhibited considerable reduction in the wound area compared to medium and high dose hydrogels. Statistically significant difference (P < 0.05) was observed in the wound area of the animals treated with low dose hydrogels compared to 1% ointment and untreated animals, as estimated by two-way ANOVA. The histopathology images of the different groups of animals also displayed the comparative changes in the wound healing process. Hence, the incorporation of Simvastatin-chitosan microparticles in PVA hydrogels has demonstrated significant wound healing efficiency at optimum dose. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

The premature and slow convergence over multi model fitness landscape is the main limitation in standard HSA. In the proposed hybrid algorithm the harmony memory vector of HSA is intelligently enhanced through PABC algorithm during the optimization process to reach the optimal solution within the search space. In hybrid approach, the exploration ability of HSA and the exploitation ability of PABC algorithm are integrated to blend the potency of both algorithms. The box plot and Wilcoxon rank sum tests are used to show the quality of the solution obtained by hybrid HS-PABC with respect to HSA.The computational results prove the integrated approach of the network reconfiguration problem along with optimal placement and sizing of DG units and shunt capacitors as an efficient approach with respect to power loss reduction and voltage profile enhancement. The results obtained on 69 and 118 node network by hybrid HS-PABC method and the standard HSA reveals the effeciency of the proposed approach which guarantees to achieve global optimal solution with less iteration. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In a cloud marketplace, the existence of wide range of Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) makes it hard for the Cloud Users (CUs) to find an appropriate CSP based on their requirements. The design of a suitable service selection framework helps the users in the selection of a suitable CSP, while motivating the CSPs to satisfy the assured Service Level Agreement (SLA) and enhance the Quality of Service (QoS). Existing service selection models employ random assignment of weights to the QoS attributes, replacement of missing data by random values, etc. which results in an inaccurate ranking of the CSPs. Moreover, these models have high computational overhead. In this study, a novel cloud service selection architecture, Hypergraph based Computational Model (HGCM) and Minimum Distance-Helly Property (MDHP) algorithm have been proposed for ranking the cloud service providers. Helly property of the hypergraph had been used to assign weights to the attributes and reduce the complexity of the ranking model, while arithmetic residue and Expectation–Maximization (EM) algorithms were used to impute missing values. Experimental results provided by MDHP under different case studies (dataset used by various research communities and synthetic dataset) confirms the ranking algorithm to be scalable and computationally attractive. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Background: Visual demands of school children tend to vary with diverse classroom environments. The study aimed to evaluate the distance and near Visual Acuity (VA) demand in Indian school classrooms and their comparison with the recommended vision standards. Materials and methods: The distance and near VA demands were assessed in 33 classrooms (grades 4 to 12) of eight schools. The VA threshold demand relied on the smallest size of distance and near visual task material and viewing distance. The logMAR equivalents of minimum VA demand at specific seating positions (desk) and among different grades were evaluated. The near threshold was converted into actual near VA demand by including the acuity reserve. The existing dimensions of chalkboard and classroom, gross area in a classroom per student and class size in all the measured classrooms were compared to the government recommended standards. Results: In 33 classrooms assessed (35±10 students per room), the average distance and near log-MAR VA threshold demand was 0.31±0.17 and 0.44±0.14 respectively. The mean distance VA demand (minimum) in front desk position was 0.56±0.18 logMAR. Increased distance threshold demand (logMAR range -0.06, 0.19) was noted in 7 classrooms (21%). The mean VA demand in grades 4 to 8 and grades 9 to 12 was 0.35±0.16 and 0.24±0.16 logMAR respectively and the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.055). The distance from board to front desk was greater than the recommended standard of 2.2m in 27 classrooms (82%). The other measured parameters were noted to be different from the proposed standards in majority of the classrooms. Conclusion: The study suggests the inclusion of task demand assessment in school vision screening protocol to provide relevant guidance to school authorities. These findings can serve as evidence to accommodate children with mild to moderate visual impairment in the regular classrooms. © 2017 Negiloni et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.},

abstract={Scientists from all over the world try to incorporate multi-disciplinary precursors to forecast the earthquake on a short-term basis. The authors here have analyzed outgoing longwave radiations acquired from polar-orbiting National Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminstration (NOAA) satellites and long-period infrasound waves recorded by the ground observatories in China prior to the recent Bonin Islands, Japan region earthquake which occurred on May 30, 2015 with the magnitude of 7.8. The anomalous outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) was observed on May 15, 2015, and was recorded by “NOAA 18” satellite during its “night pass.” Similarly, an abnormal infrasound spike was recorded at the Beijing station on May 17, 2015. The delay in observing anomalous infrasound waves compared to the OLR anomaly is due to these low-frequency waves traveling at low speed with the velocity range of 10–15 m/s. From the analysis of the results, it can be inferred that there is a substantial relation between parameters like OLR and infrasound waves; hence, the authors conclude that it is possible to forecast the earthquake on a short-term basis with reasonable accuracy. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Bay functionalized perylene diimide substituted with pyridine isomers, (2-pyridine (2HMP-PDI), 3-pyridine (3-HMP-PDI) and 4-pyridine (4-HMP-PDI)) have been synthesized and explored for selective coloro/fluorimetric sensing of heavy transition metal ions. HMP-PDIs showed strong NIR absorption (760–765 nm) in DMF. The absorption and fluorescence of HMP-PDIs have been tuned by make use of pyridine isomers. Reddish-orange color was observed for 2-HMP-PDI (λmax = 437, 551, 765 nm) whereas 4-HMP-PDI exhibited light green (λmax = 432, 522, 765 nm). 3-HMP-PDI showed orange-yellow (λmax = 431, 524, 762 nm). The fluorescence spectra of 2-, 3- and 4-HMP-PDI showed λmax at 585, 538, 546 nm, respectively. Interestingly, HMP-PDI dyes showed selective color change (intense pink color) and fluorescence quenching for Fe3+ and Al3+ metal ions in DMF. Absorbance spectra revealed complete disappearance of NIR absorption and intensification/appearance of new peak at lower wavelength. The concentration dependent studies suggest that 4-HMP-PDI can detect up to 36.52 ppb of Fe3+ and 43.12 ppb of Al3+ colorimetrically. The interference studies in presence of other metal ions confirmed the good selectivity for Fe3+ and Al3+. The mechanistic studies indicate that Lewis acidic character of Fe3+ and Al3+ ions were responsible for selective color change and fluorescence quenching. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid, member 1 (TRPV1), is a non-selective cation channel belonging to the transient receptor potential (TRP) family of ion channels. It occurs in the peripheral and central nervous system, activated by a variety of exogenous and endogenous stimuli, thus playing a key role in transmission of pain. This has been a target for chronic pain since more than a decade and a number of antagonists that progressed into clinical trials have failed due to the unexpected side effect of core body temperature rise, thus halting progress in this field. Of late, there has been an upsurge in research on this target, with the rat TRPV1 structure being determined, many new antagonists discovered that are temperature-neutral and many new therapeutic avenues being discovered for TRPV1, including diseases of respiratory and digestive systems, skin and bladder. Towards identifying diverse compounds to decipher the role of this target in various indications, here we report a 3D-QSAR model built using the new topomer-CoMFA methodology on a series of piperazinyl-aryl TRPV1 antagonists and the use of this model, along with a pharmacophore model and the shape of one of the potent compounds of this series, to virtually screen a subset of the ZINC database to find novel and diverse hits. These can serve as starting points to develop modality-selective antagonists for chronic pain and to elucidate the critical role of TRPV1 in the various new therapeutic areas. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Automatic personality perception is the prediction of personality that others attribute to a person in a given situation. The aim of automatic personality perception is to forecast the behaviour of the speaker perceived by the listener from nonverbal behavior. Extroversion, Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, Neuroticism, and Openness are the speaker traits used for personality assessment. In this work, a speaker trait prediction approach for automatic personality assessment is proposed. This approach is based on modeling the relationship between speech signal and personality traits using spectral features. The experiments are achieved over the SSPNet Personality Corpus. The Frequency Domain Linear Prediction and Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient features are extracted for the prediction of speaker traits. The classification is done using Instance based k-Nearest neighbor and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. The experimental results show that k-Nearest Neighbor classifier outperforms SVM classifier. The classification accuracy is between 90 and 100%. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={PIWI subfamily of proteins is shown to be primarily expressed in germline cells. They maintain the genomic integrity by silencing the transposable elements. Although the role of PIWI proteins in germ cells has been documented, their presence and function in somatic cells remains unclear. Intriguingly, we detected all four members of PIWI-like proteins in human ocular tissues and somatic cell lines. When HIWI2 was knocked down in retinal pigment epithelial cells, the typical honeycomb morphology was affected. Further analysis showed that the expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins, CLDN1, and TJP1 were altered in HIWI2 knockdown. Moreover, confocal imaging revealed disrupted TJP1 assembly at the TJ. Previous studies report the role of GSK3β in regulating TJ proteins. Accordingly, phospho-kinase proteome profiler array indicated increased phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3α/β in HIWI2 knockdown, suggesting that HIWI2 might affect TJ proteins through Akt-GSK3α/β signaling axis. Moreover, treating the HIWI2 knockdown cells with wortmannin increased the levels of TJP1 and CLDN1. Taken together, our study demonstrates the presence of PIWI-like proteins in somatic cells and the possible role of HIWI2 in preserving the functional integrity of epithelial cells probably by modulating the phosphorylation status of Akt. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Qualifications of intracellular structure were performed for the first time using the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) method for images of cells obtained by resolution-enhanced photothermal imaging. The GLCM method has been used to extract five parameters of texture features for five different types of cells in mouse brain; pyramidal neurons and glial cells in the basal nucleus (BGl), dentate gyrus granule cells, cerebellar Purkinje cells, and cerebellar granule cells. The parameters are correlation, contrast, angular second moment (ASM), inverse difference moment (IDM), and entropy for the images of cells of interest in a mouse brain. The parameters vary depending on the pixel distance taken in the analysis method. Based on the obtained results, we identified that the most suitable GLCM parameter is IDM for pyramidal neurons and BGI, granule cells in the dentate gyrus, Purkinje cells and granule cells in the cerebellum. It was also found that the ASM is the most appropriate for neurons in the basal nucleus. © 2017 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).},

abstract={Andrographis paniculata (A. paniculata) is a medicinal plant used in the Indian and Chinese traditional medicinal systems for its various beneficial properties of therapeutics. This is due to the presence of a diterpene lactone called ‘andrographolide’. Several biological activities like anti-inflammatory, antitumour, anti-hyperglycaemic, anti-fertility, antiviral, cardio protective and hepato-protective properties are attributed to andrographolide and its natural analogs. The studies have shown that not only this diterpene lactone (andrographolide), but also other related terpenoid analogs from A. paniculata could be exploited for disease prevention due to their structural similarity with diverse pharmacological activities. Several scientific groups are trying to unveil the underlying mechanisms involved in these biological actions brough aout by andrographolide and its analogs.

abstract={The environmental effects of production of cement have provoked to examine the growth of concrete with 100% replacement of cement with materials which are activated by alkali solutions. Alkali activated slag (AAS) concrete is eco-friendly and potentially deemed to be a division of sustainable process. As majority of the volume of concrete is consumed by aggregates, there is a necessary to decrease the utilization of natural aggregates resulting in reduction of exploiting natural resources and effective utilization of construction and demolition waste. The effect of recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) on the engineering and durability properties of alkali activated slag concrete (AASC) under ambient curing state has been investigated in this paper. Since, very few works were carried in the field of alkali activated slag concrete curing under ambient temperature state and the utilization of recycled aggregates, an investigation was performed in AASC mixes with varying RCA fraction to study their influence on strength (compressive, splitting tensile and flexural) and durability (absorption, sorptivity, chloride and sulphate exposure) properties of AASC. The outcome of the results concludes that the addition of RCA has no signification reduction in the properties of alkali activated slag concrete. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Attractors over OFDM is an emerging research concept which has immense potential for secured communication. The dynamic behavior of Rucklidge system leads to various strange attractors according to varying initial conditions and parameters. In our work one such new strange attractor has been developed and transmitted through OFDM and its behavior has been studied using MATLAB simulation. The performance of the system has been analyzed using BER vs Eb/N0 graph when the modulation schemes done with QPSK, 16-QAM and 64-QAM. It was observed that its security level has been enhanced because of the monovular nature of decoding it by using the same initial conditions as that of given at formation of strange attractor from the Rucklidge system. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={The primary role of Economic Load Dispatch (ELD) is for obtaining the most efficient operation out of a power system generation network. The main objective of performing the ELD is to minimize the generator fuel cost. The minimum cost function found using optimization techniques is a widely researched area. One such optimization technique is the Bat algorithm. In this communication, Novel Bat Algorithm has been introduced to solve the ELD problem. The Novel Bat Algorithm introduces the idea of using Doppler Effect and movement of bats between different habitats. It is compared with the Bat algorithm and the Particle Swarm Optimization to find the most efficient among them. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated by testing it on 5-unit and 6-unit systems. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={We show the existence of chimeralike states in two distinct groups of identical populations of globally coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators. The existence of chimeralike states occurs only for a small range of frequency difference between the two populations, and these states disappear for an increase of mismatch between the frequencies. Here the chimeralike states are characterized by the synchronized oscillations in one population and desynchronized oscillations in another population. We also find that such states observed in two distinct groups of identical populations of nonlocally coupled oscillators are different from the above case in which coexisting domains of synchronized and desynchronized oscillations are observed in one population and the second population exhibits synchronized oscillations for spatially prepared initial conditions. Perturbation from such spatially prepared initial condition leads to the existence of imperfectly synchronized states. An imperfectly synchronized state represents the existence of solitary oscillators which escape from the synchronized group in population I and synchronized oscillations in population II. Also the existence of chimera state is independent of the increase of frequency mismatch between the populations. We also find the coexistence of different dynamical states with respect to different initial conditions, which causes multistability in the globally coupled system. In the case of nonlocal coupling, the system does not show multistability except in the cluster state region. © 2017 American Physical Society.},

The source images are decomposed using the curvelet transform and the high frequency sub-band coefficients are fused by maximum selection rule, whereas the low frequency sub-band coefficients are fused by weighted linear combination rule. The human intelligence based brain storm optimization (BSO) algorithm is employed to find the optimal weights in fusing low frequency sub-band coefficients. Simulation have been performed to compare our results with other multi resolution fusion methods such as gradient (GRAD) pyramid, shift invariant discrete wavelet transform (SIDWT) and non sub-sampled contourlet transform (NSCT). The quality of the fused image is assessed using five different quality metrics and the results indicate that the proposed method outperforms other multiresolution fusion methods in terms of both subjective and objective quality metrics. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={The skip-lot sampling plans are widely used in industries for quality inspection of products in order to reduce the sampling costs and inspection efforts when products have good quality history. Also, the skip-lot sampling plan concept is sound and useful and it is economically advantageous to use the skip-lot approach in the design of sampling plans. Thus, the skip-lot sampling plans are useful to minimize the cost of the inspection particularly in costly and destructive testing. Hence, a new system of skip-lot sampling plans designated as SkSP-2-R plan is developed in this article by incorporating the idea of resampling procedure in the skip-lot sampling plans of type SkSP-2. A Markov chain formulation and derivation of performance measures for this new plan are presented. The properties and advantages of the SkSP-2-R plan are studied with single sampling plan as the reference plan. The response-to-change characteristics of the SkSP-2-R plan are also investigated, based on the average run length. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Ethno-pharmacological relevance Pattanga is botanically equated as Caesalpinia sappan Linn. (Family: Caesalpiniaceae) and is used in Ayurveda system of medicine since ages. According to Ayurveda, useful part is Heartwood, which is bitter, astringent and acrid and is useful in vitiated conditions of vata and pitta, burning sensation, wounds, ulcers, leprosy, skin diseases, menorrhagia, leucorrhea, and diabetes. It is used as a major ingredient in Ayurvedic formulations and preparations like Patrangasava, Chandanadya Thalia, and Karpuradyarka. Aim of the study The present study is planned to evaluate the gastroprotective activity of the selected Ayurvedic drug using three different in vivo gastric ulcer models, so as to provide scientific evidence for the Ayurvedic claims. Materials and methods For this study, Wistar albino rats fasted overnight were selected. The hydroalcoholic extract of Caesalpinia sappan heartwood at the dose level 250 and 500 mg/kg body weight was selected and administered orally before necrotizing agents. Antioxidant and antiulcer parameters were evaluated and the stomach samples were subjected for histopathological studies. In addition, PGE2 estimation and protein expressions of COX-1, COX-2 and iNOS were analyzed by Western blot. The plant extract was subjected to LCMS/MS analysis. In addition, Cytoprotective effect in isolated gastric mucosal cells, TUNEL Assay, Acid neutralizing capacity assay, H+/K+ ATPase inhibitory assay were performed. Results The ulcer protection was found to be 92%, 86% and 64% against ethanol, NSAID and pylorus ligation induced ulcer respectively. The hydro-alcoholic extract of C. sappan heartwood exhibited cytoprotective effect with 76.82% reduction against indomethacin-induced cytotoxicity at the concentration of 25 µg/ml. C. sappan showed 63.91% inhibition in H+/K+ ATPase inhibitory assay at the concentration 500 µg/ml. Conclusions Our results depict that Caesalpinia sappan heartwood possesses gastroprotective activity, possibly mediated through cytoprotection and antioxidant mechanisms. The data obtained in the present study provides scientific support for the traditional use of Caesalpinia sappan in the management of peptic ulcer. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd},

abstract={Abstract: The encapsulation of organophosphorus (OP) nerve agents by pillar[5]arene (P5) molecule, shows that adsorption occurs with a larger structural reorganization of the host molecule. The computed binding energies shows that the complexes formed are more stable inside the cavity. Tabun was found to have the highest binding energy among the studied OPs. The computed Gibbs free energy is negative for Dimethyl methylphosphonate, sarin and tabun, and are positive for soman (GD) and ethyl-S-dimethylaminoethyl methylphosphonothiolate (VX). The inclusion complexes were found to have lower band gap. The quantum theory of Atoms-in-molecules analysis shows that ρ values were positive which implies the existence of noncovalent interactions. The Laplacian of the charge density ∇2ρ for bond critical points bonds are small and are negative which indicates the depletion of electronic charge along the bond paths and existence of an electrostatic nature of bonding between the guest and host molecule. The noncovalent interactions analysis clearly shows the existence of hydrogen bonding and van der Waals bonding in these inclusion complexes. The energy decomposition analysis shows that the, interaction between the P5 and the larger guest molecules VX and GD are mainly due to electrostatic interaction and for small guest, the interactions are mostly of van der Waals type.

abstract={“The health of the people is really the foundation on which all their happiness and all their powers as a state depend.” - Benjamin Disraeli. A healthy society is obviously a healthy nation. Being healthy is a result of various factors such as lifestyle, income, choices, society, access to medical facilities, culture, and family. The life expectancy (LE) (i.e., average years a person is anticipated to live has almost doubled) in the past century and medical breakthroughs had a profoundly positive impact on human LE. The average LE of the people in India was 49.7 years during 1970-1975 gradually increased to the level of 68.45 years in 2016 according to the world LE reports. The objective here is to understand the factors determining LE and whether there are any possibilities for considerable improvements in LE in India due to various economic policies by the government. Statistical reports from various organizations are analyzed, and the conclusion is that the government spending on health care and awareness is to be enhanced. © 2017 The Authors.},

abstract={Efficiency of Enterobacter cloacae KU923381 isolated from petroleum hydrocarbon contaminated soil was evaluated in batch culture and bioreactor mode. The isolate were screened for biofilm formation using qualitative and quantitative assays. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to study the effect of pH, temperature, glucose concentration, and sodium chloride on diesel degradation. The predicted values for diesel oil degradation efficiency by the statistical designs are in a close agreement with experimental data (R2 = 99.66%). Degradation efficiency is increased by 36.78% at pH = 7, temperature = 35°C, glucose = 5%, and sodium chloride concentration = 5%. Under the optimized conditions, the experiments were performed for diesel oil degradation by gas chromatographic mass spectrometric analysis (GC-MS). GC-MS analysis confirmed that E. cloacae had highly degrade hexadecane, heptadecane, tridecane, and docosane by 99.71%, 99.23%, 99.66%, and 98.34% respectively. This study shows that rapid bioremoval of hydrocarbons in diesel oil is acheived by E. cloacae with abet of biofilm formation. The potential use of the biofilms for preparing trickling filters (gravel particles) for the degradation of hydrocarbons from petroleum wastes before their disposal in the open environment is highly suggested. This is the first successful attempt for artificially establishing petroleum hydrocarbon degrading bacterial biofilm on solid substrates in bioreactor. © 2017, The Microbiological Society of Korea and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Zinc oxide nanoparticles are one of the most extensively used nanoparticles in various commercial products. Depending on the purpose, the particles are coated with various agents including poly vinyl pyrrolidone, poly vinyl alcohol, ethylene glycol etc. As the particles are heavily used, the chance of the particles to get run off into the environment is very high. The study explains the difference in toxicity of bare and capped zinc oxide nanoparticles under various environmental conditions including humic acid and visible light against bacterial, algal and crustacean system. Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were used as model system for bacterial toxicity testing. Plate counting assay was employed for assessing the toxicity against bacteria. Chlorella pyrenoidsa was used for studying toxicity against algal system, which was evaluated using the chlorophyll estimation assay. Daphnia sp. was used for studying the toxicity in crustacean system. The particles had the ability to adsorb humic acid which further affected the stability of the particle. The study concludes that the presence of environmental factors including humic acid affects the toxicological nature of ZnO NPs. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Cardiotoxins (CTXs) are single polypeptide chain consisting of 59–62 amino acids with four disulfide bridges and globular proteins of simple β-sheet folds. The CTXs are one of principal toxic components causing haemolysis and damaging various cells and belong to three-finger toxin (TFT) superfamily of snake venoms. However, there is no natural or synthetic small molecular inhibitor to the protein toxins to date. In the present study, modes of interaction of cardiotoxin 1 (CTX1) from Indian cobra (Naja naja) with heterogeneous erythrocyte membrane (EM) model system have been extensively examined by using all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in near physiological conditions and comprehensive analyses of the MD data revealed two distinct principal regions (‘head groove’ and ‘loop groove’) of the protein toxin for establishing structural interactions with the EM system. Moreover, combined analyses of data from high-throughput virtual screening of NCI small molecular database, in vitro haemolytic assays for top-hits of the chemical compounds against crude venom of Naja naja and as well CTXs purified from the venom and pharmacokinetic examinations on the chemical compounds retarding haemolytic activities of CTXs suggested that Etidronic acid and Zoledronic acid are promising prototypic chemical inhibitors to CTXs of snake venoms. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Despite the sustainable availability, levan, a fructose based natural polysaccharide has not received significant attention in the development of enzyme immobilization technology. Herein, we prepared levan-xylanase (LXy) nanohybrid and characterized by scanning electron microscopy, particle size analyzer and zeta potential. To prevent the enzyme leakage from the nanohybrid, LXy was immobilized onto an alginate beads (NaAlg). Immobilization yield was optimized using a statistical method, central composite design. A maximum immobilization yield of 95.3% was achieved at 2.13% (w/v) of sodium alginate, 2.14% (w/v) of calcium chloride, 64 min of curation time and 1.4 mm bead size. Immobilized LXy retains nearly 80% of the enzyme activity at a wide range of temperature (20–90 °C) and pH (3–10). Immobilization of LXy onto NaAlg increases the activation energy from 28.50 J mol−1 K−1 to 39.38 J mol−1 K−1. Collectively, this result implies that LXy immobilized onto NaAlg increases the enzyme stability and retains its activity. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Surface functionalizations of quantum dots (QDs) are expected to improve their optoelectronic properties and advance their targeting nature, which is highly warranted for application in molecular imaging and biomedical diagnostics. Therefore, an understanding the interaction between surface functionalization agents and QDs is a prerequisite for their application. Herein, we investigated the interaction between cadmium sulfide (CdS) QDs and dietary T-antigen binding lectin (jacalin) isolated from Indian jack fruit seeds. Fluorescence spectroscopy study showed that CdS QDs effectively quenched the intrinsic fluorescence of jacalin. Analysis of fluorescence quenching at a different temperature indicated that the mechanism of interaction is static and a non-radiation energy transfer occurred within the molecules. The obtained binding constant, Ka value in the order of 104 M−1 at the tested temperature range suggested that the binding affinity between jacalin and CdS QDs is in the same range as those obtained for the interaction of lectin with carbohydrate. Thermodynamic analysis of the binding data, ΔH0=−44.24±1.21 kJ mol−1, ΔS0=−60.92±4.10 J mol− 1 K−1 and ΔG0=−26.21±0.1 kJ mol−1 suggested that the binding reaction is enthalpy-driven spontaneous process. Hemagglutination activity of jacalin is well preserved even after binding to CdS QDs, indicating that the jacalin-CdS QDs complex can recognize T-antigens of the malignant tissues. To support the claim, we demonstrated selective fluorescence labeling of chronic myeloid leukemia cells, K562 with jacalin-CdS QDs complex. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In this paper, a novel information hiding scheme based on pseudo magic squares is proposed. The pseudo magic square pattern is generated using the Knight’s move algorithm, whereas diamond encoding (DE) and adaptive pixel pair matching (APPM) embedding schemes adapts rhombic shaped and non-uniform pattern respectively. The momentous feature of the proposed embedding scheme is its ability to generate several pseudo magic squares for a given embedding parameter. On contrary, DE and APPM map one fixed pattern to an embedding parameter. Thus, the proposed system can achieve higher payloads by concealing data using a pattern chosen from a variety of compact neighborhood sets. Depending on the size of the message bits, the order of the pseudo magic square is determined and one pattern among the set of the possible pseudo magic squares can be utilized during the embedding phase. The secret digits are embedded in the cover image based on a randomized sequence. The performance analysis in the experimental results reveal that the proposed algorithm not only provides increased payload with less distortion but also increases the security of the embedding processing by allowing the application to employ one among the several square patterns for every secure communication. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

The algorithm for fusing the images is based on the supporting structure of normalized convolution. Here the idea is projection of local signals onto a subspace. The adaptive nature of the window function in adaptive normalized convolution helps to gather more samples for processing and increases signal-to-noise ratio, decreases diffusion through discontinuities. The validation of proposed method is done using simulated experiments and real-time experiments. These experimental results are compared with various latest techniques using performance measures like peak signal-to-noise ratio, sharpness index and blind image quality index. In both the cases of experiments, the proposed adaptive normalized convolution-based super-resolution image reconstruction has proved to be highly efficient which is needed for satellite imaging, medical imaging diagnosis, military surveillance, remote sensing, etc. © 2016, Springer-Verlag London.},

abstract={This work proposes an augmented facility to the existing LFU-based web cache replacement policy. The proposed policy takes into account three additional factors such as dynamicity of the cached pages, semantic relation between the cached and the incoming pages, and least frequently used web pages and the impact of the victimized pages to decide the pages to be purged. Hence, it is named as DSLV to reveal this strategy. This policy is intended to improve the performance of only the client cache. By introducing dynamicity levels, obsolete pages are filtered from the caching process. The semantic module identifies the semantic relationship between the cached pages. Therefore, the new incoming page and the cached pages can be customized as per the interest of the users and their access pattern. The best variation in LFU policy that avoids cache pollution is adopted. Victims are the pages that are removed from the cache for want of space. These victimized pages are monitored so that the victim module identifies the reason for getting victimized and tries to tune the policy for better performance measures. Simulation results ranked by the performance metrics namely file hit ratio, speedup, delay saving ratio, and number of evictions disclose strong induction for this kind of customized technique for client cache as an efficient enhancement to the already established LFU replacement policy. © 2016, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals.},

abstract={Aim: Regeneration of functional peripheral nerve tissue at critical-sized defect requires extracellular matrix analogs impregnated with appropriate biosignals to regulate the cell fate process and subsequent tissue progression. The aim of the study was to develop electrospun aligned nanofibers as architectural analogs integrated with RADA16-I-BMHP1 as biofunctional peptides. Materials & methods: Aligned poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA)-RADA16-I-BMHP1 nanofibers were fabricated and characterized for their in vitro potential using rat Schwann cell line and in vivo potential using a 10 mm sciatic nerve transection rat model. Results: PLGA-peptide scaffolds significantly promoted higher expression of genotypic markers and bipolar extension of Schwann cells. Further, PLGA-peptide treated animals promoted the native collagen organization, remyelination and showed significantly higher recovery of sensorimotor and motor function than PLGA-treated groups (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that self-assembling peptide nanostructures on aligned PLGA nanofibers provided better cell-matrix communication with significant functional restoration of the sciatic nerve. © 2017 Future Medicine Ltd.},

abstract={The present study was aimed to determine the efficacy of nicorandil in treating cardiac reperfusion injury with an underlying co-morbidity of vascular calcification (VC). Adenine diet was used to induce VC in Wistar rat and the heart was isolated to induce global ischemia reperfusion (IR) by Langendorff method, with and without the nicorandil (7.5 mg/kg) pre-treatment and compared with those fed on normal diet. The adenine-treated rats displayed abnormal ECG changes and altered mitochondrial integrity compared to a normal rat heart. These hearts, when subjected to IR increased the infarct size, cardiac injury (measured by lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase activity in the coronary perfusate) and significantly altered the hemodynamics compared to the normal perfused heart. Nicorandil pretreatment in rat fed on normal diet enhanced the hemodynamics significantly (P &lt; 0.05) along with a substantial reduction in the mitochondrial dysfunction (measured by high ADP to oxygen consumption ratio, respiratory control ratio, enzyme activities and less swelling behavior) when subjected to IR. However, this cardio-protective effect of nicorandil was absent in rat heart with underlying calcification. Our results suggest that, the protective effect of nicorandil, a known mitochondrial ATP linked K+ channel opener, against myocardial reperfusion injury was confined to normal rat heart. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Ornithine is a non-essential amino acid produced as an intermediate molecule in urea cycle. It is a key substrate for the synthesis of proline, polyamines and citrulline. Ornithine also plays an important role in the regulation of several metabolic processes leading to diseases like hyperorithinemia, hyperammonemia, gyrate atrophy and cancer in humans. However, the mechanism of action behind the multi-faceted roles of ornithine is yet to be unraveled completely. Several types of cancers are also characterized by excessive polyamine synthesis from ornithine by different rate limiting enzymes. Hence, in this review we aim to provide extensive insights on potential roles of ornithine in many of the disease related cellular processes and also on the structural features of ornithine interacting proteins, enabling development of therapeutic modalities. © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS},

abstract={The evolution of a separated boundary layer over a model airfoil with semicircular leading-edge has been illustrated for angles of attack (α) varying from -3 deg to 10 deg, where the Reynolds number (Rec) based on chord is 1.6 × 105 and the inlet freestream turbulence (fst) being 1.2%. The features of boundary layer are described through measurements of velocity and surface pressure besides the flow visualization using a planar particle image velocimetry (PIV). Freestream perturbations are amplified because of enhanced receptivity of the separated boundary layer resulting in pockets of disturbances, which then propagate downstream attributing to random fluctuations near the reattachment. The separation and reattachment locations including the onset and end of transition are identified for changing α. The reattachment point changes from 18.8% to 47.7% of chord with the onset of separation at almost 7%, whereas the onset of transition moves upstream from 13.2% to 9% with increasing α. The bubble bursting occurs at α = 10 deg. The transition in the separated boundary layer occurs through Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) instability for α = 0 deg and 3 deg, whereas the K-H mechanism is bypassed for higher α with significant viscous effect. © Copyright 2017 by ASME.},

abstract={Numerical studies on plate fins with longitudinal rectangular perforations placed perpendicular to an aluminum base plate are carried out under laminar natural convection conditions. In this paper, a detailed parametric study by varying the dimensions of fin and perforation is carried out to obtain a physical insight into the enhanced heat transfer characteristics of a perforated fin. The perforated fins are found to have an augmented heat transfer rate compared to the solid fins having same contact area. This paper uses a computationally efficient algorithm using soft computing to determine the optimized geometry with a limited set of numerical solutions. This is achieved with the help of artificial neural network (ANN). To reduce the effort in determining suitable parameters for ANN, genetic algorithm (GA) is used. The ANN is trained based on a minimal set of numerical/computational fluid dynamics (CFD) results. The trained ANN can then predict the base plate temperature for any other untrained set of parameters in the same range. A multiobjective optimization of the perforated fin is carried out with two objectives: minimum base plate temperature and maximum weight reduction. This is carried out by applying the GA on the ANN as the fitness function to obtain the multiobjective optimal. The obtained optimized fin geometry can thus be used effectively in many heat transfer applications that necessitate heat transfer enhancement with reduced weight compared to the conventional fins. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper focused on the effect of geometrical and machining parameters such as rake angle, nose radius, cutting speed, feed rate, and depth of cut on temperature rise during end milling operation. The experiments were conducted on Al 6351 with high-speed steel end mill cutter. Central composite rotatable experimental design methodology was employed to conduct the experiments. The temperature rise during machining was measured using K-type thermocouple coupled with the thermal indicator. A prediction model was developed using response surface methodology and the adequacy of the model was verified using analysis of variance. The predictive model was used to analyze direct and interaction effect of the machining parameters on temperature rise, which helps to select proper combination of machining parameters to obtain better quality in machining. Genetic algorithm was applied to optimize the machining process parameters to obtain minimum rise in temperature. A program was developed using C language to do the optimization and the best optimal combination of machining parameters gave a value of 0.0105 °C. © 2015, The Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering.},

abstract={Theranostics has received considerable attention since both therapy and imaging modalities can be integrated into a single nanocarrier. In this study, fluorescent iron oxide (FIO) nanoparticles and gemcitabine (G) encapsulated poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanospheres (PGFIO) conjugated with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, (HER-2) antibody (HER-PGFIO) were prepared and characterized. HER-PGFIO showed the magnetic moment of 10 emu/g, relaxivity (r2) of 773 mM−1 s−1 and specific absorption rate (SAR) of 183 W/g. HER-PGFIO showed a sustained release of gemcitabine for 11 days in PBS (pH 7.4). In vitro cytotoxicity evaluation of HER-PGFIO in 3D MIAPaCa-2 cultures showed 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.11 mg/mL. Subcutaneous tumor xenografts of MIAPaCa-2 in SCID mice were developed and the tumor regression study at the end of 30 days showed significant tumor regression (86 ± 3%) in the HER-PGFIO with magnetic hyperthermia (MHT) treatment group compared to control group. In vivo MRI imaging showed the enhanced contrast in HER-PGFIO + MHT treated group compared to control. HER-PGFIO showed significant tumor regression and enhanced MRI in treatment groups, which could be an effective nanocarrier system for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Statement of Significance Combination therapies are best suitable to treat pancreatic cancer. Theranostics are the next generation therapeutics with both imaging and treatment agents encapsulated in a single nanocarrier. The novelty of the present work is the development of targeted nanocarrier that provides chemotherapy, thermotherapy and MRI imaging properties. The present work is the next step in developing the nanocarriers for pancreatic cancer treatment. Different treatment modalities embedding into a single nanocarrier is the biggest challenge that was achieved without compromising the functionality of each other. The surface modification of polymeric nanocarriers for antibody binding and their multifunctional abilities will appeal to wider audience. © 2016 Acta Materialia Inc.},

To accomplish the proposed aim, we consider the thermo-optic coefficient of chloroform and silica to anlayse the temperature dependent propagation characteristics of the proposed DEPCF. The unique property of temperature dependent effective refractive index has been exploited to tune coupling length and transmission spectrum, using finite element method.

abstract={Low vision and blindness are important health problems that affect millions of people throughout the world. The most common and important pathologies are diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma as well as cataracts. The latter consists of an opacification of the lens of the eye which impedes the passage of light and represents one of the most important causes of vision loss. Among the risk factors for cataract development, there are life-style factors such as the use of tobacco, abuse of alcohol and unhealthy diet. In light of this, dietary components that possess anti-oxidant activity, such as polyphenols for instance, can be considered good candidates for human studies in the prevention and or treatment of such diseases. Among dietary components, the antioxidant capacity of certain polyphenols is well known, and these could be good candidates. In this review we focus our attention on the current scientific literature regarding to the effects of resveratrol on cataracts and other ocular diseases, along with its potential mechanism/s of action. A large number of preclinical studies support the involvement of resveratrol in clinical trials for the prevention and treatment of eye diseases induced by oxidative stress and inflammation, such as age-related cataract. © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS},

abstract={Background: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in lipoprotein lipase gene (LPL) have been shown to influence metabolism related to lipid phenotypes. Dietary factors have been shown to modify the association between LPL SNPs and lipids; however, to date, there are no studies in South Asians. Hence, we tested for the association of four common LPL SNPs with plasma lipids and examined the interactions between the SNPs and dietary factors on lipids in 1,845 Asian Indians. Methods: The analysis was performed in 788 Type 2 diabetes cases and 1,057 controls randomly chosen from the cross-sectional Chennai Urban Rural Epidemiological Study. Serum triacylglycerol (TAG), serum total cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were measured using a Hitachi-912 autoanalyzer (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). Dietary intake was assessed using a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. The SNPs (rs1121923, rs328, rs4922115 and rs285) were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction followed by restriction enzyme digestion and 20% of samples were sequenced to validate the genotypes obtained. Statistical Package for Social Sciences for Windows version 22.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL) was used for statistical analysis. Results: After correction for multiple testing and adjusting for potential confounders, SNPs rs328 and rs285 showed association with HDL-C (P = 0.0004) and serum TAG (P = 1×10−5), respectively. The interaction between SNP rs1121923 and fat intake (energy %) on HDL-C (P = 0.003) was also significant, where, among those who consumed a high fat diet (28.4 ± 2.5%), the T allele carriers (TT + XT) had significantly higher HDL-C concentrations (P = 0.0002) and 30% reduced risk of low HDL-C levels compared to the CC homozygotes. None of the interactions on other lipid traits were statistically significant. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that individuals carrying T allele of the SNP rs1121923 have increased HDL-C levels when consuming a high fat diet compared to CC homozygotes. Our finding warrants confirmation in prospective studies and randomized controlled trials. © 2017 The Author(s).},

We proposed a preprocessor to overcome the shortcomings of full parsing and modules to handle the partial outcome. The developed system, not only has the viability to be maintained easily, but also can adapt itself for a particular domain. In the primary experiment, out of 131 argument structures extracted from 96 sentences, 32 were extractable, 33 with ambiguity and the remaining 66 (non-extractable) for which partial result was determined. The work produced better result than the other full parser with reduced count of failure in extraction and ambiguity. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Histogram equalization (HE) is one of the simplest and effective methods for contrast enhancement. The contrast of an image is increased by HE. But HE fails to produce satisfactory results for wide range of low contrast images, because HE does not use a spatial feature that is included in an original image. In order to overcome this disorder the differential gray-levels histogram equalization (DHE) has been proposed. In this paper, we extend the DHE to color image processing. Then, hue and intensity information are taken into account for color image enhancement. Hue component is used for intensity processing. Even by keeping the intensity constant we can capture the edge by changing the hue. First the processing is done with intensity component and then with hue component. Finally intensity and hue component results are combined to produce better results. The proposed method has one parameter which controls the enhancement property of the color image. The guideline for the decision of the parameter which is agreed by the human sense is also described. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Glucose, a chief energy source in cellular metabolism, has a significant role in cell proliferation. Cancer cells utilize more glucose than normal cells to meet the energy demand arising due to their uncontrolled proliferation. The present work reports the development of a nano-interfaced amperometric biosensor for rapid and accurate monitoring of glucose utilization by cancer cells. A hybrid nano-interface comprising a blend of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene (GR) was employed to enhance the surface area of the working electrode and favour direct electron transfer. Glucose oxidase (GOx) immobilized on the interface serves as the sensing element due to its high selectivity and sensitivity towards glucose. Utilization of glucose was monitored at pre-determined time intervals in MiaPaCa-2 cancer cells. The results obtained from the amperometric technique were compared with the values obtained from a commercial glucometer. Alamar blue assay was performed to check the proliferation rate of the cells. A good correlation was obtained between the proliferation rate and glucose utilization. The designed biosensor was found to be unaffected by the presence of potential interferents and hence may serve as a novel in vitro tool to rapidly quantify the proliferation rates of cancer cells in response to different treatment strategies. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

Dielectric constant and dielectric loss measurements were carried out at different temperatures in the frequency range of 50 Hz - 2 MHz. The photoluminescence spectrum was recorded in the wavelength range 200–400 nm and the estimated optical band gap was ∼4.1 eV. Etching studies were carried out for different etching time. Thermal stability of CBLPM was determined using thermogravimetric analysis. Laser induced damage threshold study was carried out for the grown crystal using Nd:YAG laser. Size dependent second harmonic generation efficiency of the grown crystal was determined by Kurtz and Perry powder technique with different particle size using Nd:YAG laser with wavelength 1064 nm.

abstract={Biomechanical performance of functional cartilage is executed by the exclusive anisotropic composition and spatially varying intricate architecture in articulating ends of diarthrodial joint. Osteochondral tissue constituting the articulating ends comprise superfical soft cartilage over hard subchondral bone sandwiching interfacial soft-hard tissue. The shock-absorbent, lubricating property of cartilage and mechanical stability of subchondral bone regions are rendered by extended chemical structure of glycosaminoglycans and mineral deposition, respectively. Extracellular matrix glycosaminoglycans analogous polysaccharides are major class of hydrogels investigated for restoration of functional cartilage. Recently, injectable hydrogels have gained momentum as it offers patient compliance, tunable mechanical properties, cell deliverability, and facile administration at physiological condition with long-term functionality and hyaline cartilage construction. Interestingly, facile modifiable functional groups in carbohydrate polymers impart tailorability of desired physicochemical properties and versatile injectable chemistry for the development of highly potent biomimetic in situ forming scaffold. The scaffold design strategies have also evolved from single component to bi- or multilayered and graded constructs with osteogenic properties for deep subchondral regeneration. This review highlights the significance of polysaccharide structure-based functions in engineering cartilage tissue, injectable chemistries, strategies for combining analogous matrices with cells/stem cells and biomolecules and multicomponent approaches for osteochondral mimetic constructs. Further, the rheology and precise spatiotemporal positioning of cells in hydrogel bioink for rapid prototyping of complex three-dimensional anisotropic cartilage have also been discussed. © 2016 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={The use of renewable resources to develop functional materials is increasing in order to meet the sustainability challenges. In an era of inexorable evolution of antimicrobial resistance, there is a substantial increase in demand for the development of efficient antimicrobial thin film coating from renewable resources for public bacterial threats, food, biomedical, and industrial applications. In the present investigation, we have used cardanol, a phenolic compound having unsaturated hydrophobic tail isolated from cashew fruits, and linseed oil, a vegetable oil and an important biobased building block, which are cheap and easy to regenerate. This study reports the synthesis of cardanol based metal complexes having unsaturated hydrophobic unit and acrylated epoxidized linseed oil (AELO) prepared via epoxidation of double bonds followed by acrylation. The double bond present in the metal complexes and AELO is prone to form assembled thin film under atmospheric conditions, without the need of any initiators. Assembled thin film is one of the important aspects of nanotechnology holding a wide range of applications. 1H NMR and FT-IR analysis revealed the existence of a strong interaction between ligand and metal, which paves a way to develop a nonleachable metal based thin film coating. The leaching behavior of thin film coating was investigated under various aggressive conditions with the aid of UV-vis spectroscopy. The mechanical properties of assembled thin film coating material composed of cardanol-based metal complex and AELO are described using oscillatory rheology. Morphological and SAXD analysis clearly revealed the formation of the assembled structure in thin films. Thermal response of these materials has been investigated using TGA and DSC measurements. Intrinsic hydrophobic character was identified by contact angle measurement. Antimicrobial and biofilm inhibitory behavior of synthesized compounds and thin films were investigated against various human pathogenic bacterial strains. The assembled thin film coated catheter tube completely inhibits the biofilm formation of uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). Thus, the developed thin film coating material holds promise to be used as metal enabled, nonleachable coating materials for public bacterial threats, and food and biomedical applications. In particular, this material can be potentially used for developing urinary catheter tubes with antibacterial properties. © 2016 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Image registration deals with establishing correspondences between images of the same scene or object. An image registration algorithm should handle the variations introduced by the imaging system capturing the scene. Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) is an image registration algorithm based on local features in an image. Compared to the previous registration algorithms, SIFT is more robust to variations caused by changes in size, illumination, rotation, and viewpoint of the images. Owing to its performance, the algorithm is widely studied, modified, and successfully applied in many image and video based applications, in the domains such as medicine, industry, and defense. This paper is an outcome of extensive study on the state-of-art image registration algorithms based on SIFT. Around 20 algorithms based on the SIFT algorithm is discussed. A classification is made based on the objective with which the basic algorithm is modified. A comparative study on the performance, methodology of each technique is presented along with their applicability to various image processing applications and domains. © 2017 IETE.},

abstract={Casting defects account great threat to a growing foundry, since it is directly related to the economy. In this work, grey cast pump adapter casting process in a foundry is optimized to produce quality castings using design of experiments (DOE) and Computer aided Engineering (CAE) approaches. Prominent parameters like clay percentage, moisture percentage and mould hardness are considered for performing DOE with three different levels of Box–Behnken Design. Experimental trials were conducted and number of defective components was measured. Results are evaluated using Design Expert Evaluation software to obtain optimal settings. Analysis of Variance test revealed contribution level of each parameter in the casting process. DOE is an efficient tool to optimize casting process that can produce quality castings. In addition, possible defects in castings are analysed using CAE technique (PROCAST simulation software). Simulation using PROCAST is carried out to investigate internal defects by carefully designing gating and feeding parameters in pump adapter castings. Bottom filling is encouraged in the mould cavity to control metal filling process. It can be inferred that DOE and CAE PROCAST simulation has enabled to achieve uniform cooling rate and directional solidification to produce defect free grey cast pump adapter castings. © 2016 Engineers Australia.},

abstract={Sucrose, the most abundant disaccharide in Nature, contains glucose and fructose. In most of the plants sucrose accumulates in the leaves or gets stored in developing fruits, seeds, roots and tubers. Sucrose along with starch serves as a reserve carbohydrate in most of the plants (Nagem et al., 2004). Sucrose synthesis and cleavage in plants is significant in plant metabolism (Zheng et al., 2011; Figueroa et al., 2013). First it was believed that sucrose and its metabolism is a characteristic feature of plants only, but it was later found in oxygenic photosynthetic organisms. In cyanobacteria, sucrose serves as a carbon source and its metabolism is significant in nitrogen fixation. Recent studies show the presence of sucrose-related genes in non-photosynthetic organisms, such as proteobacteria, firmicutes and planctomycetes. These organisms would have acquired the genes of sucrose metabolism by horizontal gene transfer (Wu et al., 2015). © 2017 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={E-learning has become one of the famous platforms for academics and also in commercial environments, because in recent days, there is an exceptional in development and communication technologies. Also this platform gives a favourable chance for learners to study courses online, along with this, it provides a step to train themselves, through the asynchronous and synchronous learning network models. Certainly, conventional method of learning deals with the “one size fits all” approach, which leads to favour one educational approach, since in a regular class situation, teacher has to handle many students at the same time, this will create a stress, the students has to receive the same materials in this situation, ignoring their own requirement, desire, or choice. In e-learning method, numerous course materials will be available, where the learners feel hard to look for a suitable resource based on their requirements. So, recommender system (RS) is introduced, which is an appropriate solution for resource overload in e-learning environment. In order to get the efficient learning of knowledge and experience, the recommendation of content learning should consider the contextual information of learners, e.g., prior expertise of knowledge, target, method of learning, learning time, area of location and personal interests. Plenty of research work has been performed on E-learning system which mainly concentrates on the student’s requirements. In these research work, different methodologies has been used, they are: Multi-model ontology-based framework, Collaborative Filtering (CF) approach, Preference and Opinion-based REcommendation (PORE) algorithm, Proactive context-Aware recommender system, Ontology-based approach, Protus system for recommendation. The current research methodologies are explained with their advantages and disadvantages, so accordingly future work will be focused. © 2017, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.

The following suggestions are made to shop floor to eliminate the forging defect in the same product should be carried out. Fillet cracks can be eliminated through increasing the flash surface but it should not increase the thickness of the components. So optimizing the flash is needed. Overheating cracks and black spots can be reduced by using cleaning of furnace before forging and product should not be overheated and reheated during the forging. Slug material weight should be monitored before forging, Change in weight of the slug than the optimal weight has influence in the flow-ability which has chance of producing the fillet cracks. © 2017, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.

abstract={As the technology is growing rapidly in recent years, communication and signal processing systems become more complex with the increase in a number of elements or devices. To produce more reliable devices by eliminating the errors occurred by transient faults, there is a need for fault-tolerant techniques like Dual Modular Redundancy, Triple Modular Redundancy, and N-Modular Redundancy. These techniques often contain hardware redundancy which allows continued operation in the presence of faults and recovers the faulty hardware quickly and efficiently. Digital filters are one of the most commonly used in many applications, communications with filtering applications, data storage in CD-ROM or any hard disk drive, audio processing applications, and video processing applications. In this paper, different 5-modular redundancy configurations are used to get better performance, to lower the total power dissipation and to occupy less area. The circuits are synthesized and implemented on Altera EP4CE115F29C7 FPGA device using Quartus II 13.1 synthesis tool. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={In the current Internet era, social networks serve as a great platform for production and spread of real-time information. The complex web of a huge number of individuals connected to each other in a social network helps in spreading information. This phenomenon is called information diffusion. Information diffusion or ‘word of mouth’ technique is used in numerous number of applications like viral marketing, analyzing the spread of virus through a network, popular blog posts etc. In this project, various existing diffusion models used for spreading information are analyzed. To initiate the diffusion process, influential users (seed set) are found using degree discount heuristics. Utilizing the advantages of the existing diffusion models, a new hybrid model is created. Based on multi-level filters like location, gender, age and interests the activation probability and node threshold values are assigned. The existing models and the new hybrid model are compared with each other with parameters like seed set size and accuracy level. Finally, the hybrid model is proved to be the most efficient one in terms of relevance to whom the information is spread. © 2017, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc..

The system can be defined as an electronic medium that can store complete or partial patients record. To maintain these records, safe and secure methods are applied. There exists a two-factor authentication scheme for this system. But this scheme faced some security problems like password leak, lead to some attacks (card loss, offline) etc. Thus we proposed an efficient three-factor authentication scheme. This includes username; password and Biometric verification like face detection and thumb impression. Methodologies that are used for Biometric verification are RGB method and GrayScale. RGB method for face detection includes color, contrast, and saturation. Gray Scale method for thumb impression includes width, direction and angle. By these methods proposed system will overcome the existing problems. The advantage of the proposed system is very secured by using three-factor authentications.

abstract={Developments of social networking internet scenario are recommended for the requirements of scalable, authentic, secure group communication model like multicasting. Multicasting is an inter network service that offers efficient delivery of data from a source to multiple destinations. Even though multicast has been very successful at providing an efficient and best-effort data delivery service for huge groups, it verified complex process to expand other features to multicast in a scalable way. Separately, the requirement for secure electronic information had become gradually more apparent. Since multicast applications are deployed for mainstream purpose the need to secure multicast communications will become significant. There are various methods had discussed about the Scalability and Security of Multicasting. Here, analyzed about the current Multicasting schemes and provides an overview of emerging Scalable Secure Multicasting and related research work done in this area. Also comparisons are done between the various schemes to explain the advantages and limitations. There are different measures on performance of multicasting scheme depends upon the network size, group size, security, execution time, control overhead, data transmission overhead, bandwidth overhead, Key generation, and number of signatures, throughput, data loss, energy consumption and multicast group joining delay. In this paper, experimental evaluation shows that the performance analysis of the multicasting schemes on the basis of Response time, Average Energy Efficiency, Packet Delivery ratio, Key length and Average joining Delay. © 2017, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc..

abstract={In a life time, a person visits several hospitals to undergo medical examination for various health issues. When new health issues occur, a record of recent medical reports is necessary for diagnosis. Therefore it is crucial to exchange patient’s diagnostic information between the hospitals securely. To transmit such information securely in deceptive environment the effective way is encrypting and hiding it over patient digital photographic image and medical image. Among the various hiding techniques the most widely used technique for medical images is the Least Significant Bit (LSB) substitution technique. Many LSB substitution techniques were developed to enhance both security and image quality of stego-medical images. However, existing approaches were failed to maintain the quality of original images. To overcome this problem we proposed an Adaptive Row-Column (ARC) approach for LSB substitution technique that minimize mean square error (MSE) values and maximize the Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) to get both enhanced security and image quality. To further enhance the security and image quality of stego-medical images ARC algorithm is extended to embed both original and inverted cipher text (ARC-OI). © 2017, Scientific Publishers of India.

In the first layer, a different encryption technique is used through which the secret message in English language is translated into the combinations of different human languages based on the sender’s secret key. Using self constructed alphabet matrices the plain text is converted into Unicode format for three Indian languages Tamil, Hindi and Kannadam. A new key generation algorithm is designed to select the language combination. In the second layer, the translated secret data is further encrypted by the method of diagonal indexing. In the third layer, the resulting text is embedded into a cover text, from which a key is created using the position of the matched letters. In the fourth layer,after that the cover text is embedded in an image using last pixel bit embedding method and that image is passed to the receiver along with the key embedded in a separate image. We implemented the proposed method and tested for various size digital images and secret information. We also analyzed the PSNR values of stego-images to show the excellence of the proposed method. © 2017, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Social media are the technologies used for sharing the information through virtual communities and networks. Social media uses online social networks through linking the user’s profile with other individuals or groups. Multicasting denotes the forwarding messages to multiple receivers (R) through intermediate receivers (IR).However, the multicast method poses significant challenges in providing higher confidentiality and secured message multicasting rate in social media. In order to increase the confidentiality rate and secured message multicasting rate, Bloom Hash Signcryption based Secure Message Multicasting (BHS-SMM) Technique is introduced. BHS-SMM Technique is implemented using bloom filter hashing model and signcryption model. In BHS-SMM Technique using bloom filter hashing model, the messages are inserted into bloom filter using hash function with minimum space complexity. After inserting the message into the bloom filter, multicasting process is carried out in BHS-SMM Technique. For preserving the message in secured manner during multicasting process, signcryption model is introduced. Using signcryption model, only the authorized receivers access the message through performing the encryption and signature verification process. The encryption process is used to convert the plain text into cipher text with help of sender private and secret key. Finally, the digital signature is verified using public key of sender and the nun signcryption is performed where the cipher text is converted into the plain text. This helps to increase the confidentiality rate. An experimental result shows that the proposed BHS-SMM technique improves the security in terms of confidentiality rate, space complexity, communication overhead and secured message multicasting rate compared to the state-of-the-art works. © 2017, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.

abstract={This paper empirically estimates the volatility of stock returns in National Stock Exchange of India (NSE) and Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) by using symmetric and asymmetric GARCH models. Daily data of Nifty 50, Nifty midcap 100, BSE 30 Sensex and BSE 200 index covering the period from 30th September, 2006 to 15th, September, 2016 were used for analysis. Lagrange Multiplier (LM) test was employed to check the presence of heteroscedasticity in residual of returns series. LM test reveals the presence of ARCH effects in returns of Nifty 50, Nifty midcap 100, BSE 30 Sensex and BSE 200 indices. The result from GARCH model reveals that previous and current news had impacts on conditional volatility of stock returns in NSE and BSE. The result from TGARCH and EGARCH models suggest that bad news generates more conditional volatility than good news of same magnitude. The result of Power GARCH models however show that positive shocks increases conditional volatility than negative shocks of same magnitude. Finally the result shows that the existence of persistence volatility, asymmetric effects and volatility clustering in National Stock Exchange of India (NSE) and Bombay Stock Exchange of India (BSE).},

abstract={The adsorption behaviour and electronic properties of ethanol vapour on MgFe2O4 ceramic nanostructures are studied using density functional theory technique. The structural stability of MgFe2O4 nanostructure is determined with the help of formation energy. The adsorption behaviour of ethanol molecules on MgFe2O4 base material is analysed in terms of average energy gap variation, Mulliken charge transfer, band gap and adsorption energy. The most prominent adsorption sites of ethanol vapours on MgFe2O4 nanostructure are investigated at atomistic level. The density of states spectrum reveals the clear picture about the electronic properties of MgFe2O4 nanostructure. The density of states and electronic band gap confirmed the adsorption of ethanol vapours on MgFe2O4 nanostructure. The changes in the energy band gap and density of states are observed upon adsorption of ethanol vapour molecules on MgFe2O4 nanostructure. The density of states spectrum also confirms the changes in peak maxima due to the transfer of electrons between MgFe2O4 nanostructure and ethanol vapours. The adsorption of oxygen atom from ethanol vapour on iron in MgFe2O4 is found to be more prominent rather than other adsorption sites. The findings show that MgFe2O4 nanostructure can be utilized to sense the presence of ethanol vapour in the atmosphere.},

abstract={This research work investigates the performance, combustion and emission characteristics of a low heat rejection engine operated on diesel and diethyl ether blends. The combustion chamber walls of the diesel engine insulated by ceramic material were referred to as low heat rejection (LHR) engine. In the LHR engine, an improvement in fuel economy would be obtained by recovering the waste heat rejected to the cooling system as useful work. Initially, the diesel fuel was tested in the conventional engine as a baseline reading for comparison. Then the engine was insulated by coating the engine components of the piston crown and the cylinder liner with aluminum titanate using plasma spray method. In this work, the experiments are conducted using diesel and diethyl ether blends in a conventional and low heat rejection engine at constant speed condition. The experimental results indicate that the brake thermal efficiency increases with increased percentage of diethyl ether in the blends. The maximum brake thermal efficiency was found to be 33.24% for LHR engine using diesel-diethyl ether blend (Diesel 85% &amp; Diethyl ether 15% by volume) at full load condition. The emissions of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon are decreased due to better combustion characteristics and higher NOX emissions are observed with low heat rejection engine (LHR) compared to the conventional engine using diesel and blended fuels.

From the Legendre spectral solutions, we are then able to analyze the efficiency of the enzymatic reaction model parameters on the solutions to the dynamic Michaelis-Menten enzymatic reaction equations. The numerical results demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed spectral approach. The Legendre computational matrix method (LCMM) is shown to be a, rather useful and efficient tool for constructing analytical solutions to the dynamic Michaelis-Menten enzymatic reaction equations. Convergence analysis of the proposed method is discussed. Some illustrative examples are given to demonstrate the validity and applicability of the proposed method.},

abstract={In the present scenario of emerging concepts of nano materials and micro technologies, researchers are investigating how and what nano materials can be used to improve different characteristics of conventional concrete. With increase in trend towards the wider use of concrete for prestressed concrete and high rise buildings there is a growing demand concrete with higher strength. In the present research, the effect of nano silica on high performance concrete has for been studied. Nano silica is an ultrafine airborne material with spherical particles less than 20 nm in diameter, the average being about 15 nm. Concrete mixes prepared by replacing portland cement with nano silica at 1%, 1.5%, 2%, 2.5%, 3% with curing age of 28 days. The mechanical tests like-compressive strength, flexural strength, modulus of elasticity, splitting tension test and rapid chloride permeability test of high performance concrete were studied. The micro analyses were studied using scanning electron microscope and energy dispersive spectroscopy to know the effect of nano silica on high performance concrete. The experiment result shows that, at 3% of nano silica has better mechanical properties, voids were also reduced because of that denser matrix was formed in the high performance concrete. © 2017, Fundatia Serban Solacolu.

abstract={One of the most important concepts which plays a critical role in marketing, is brand positioning. Most of the companies now regard positioning at the heart of competitive strategy. As the ultimate aim of any business strategy is to satisfy the customer, gaining a valued position in the minds of customers is essential. Brand positioning refers to target consumer‘s reason to buy the company’s brand in preference to others. It ensures that all brand activities have a common aim; is guided, directed and delivered by the brand‘s benefits and reasons to buy; and it focuses at all points of contact with the consumer. In simple terms, it is relating to what customer think when they think about a brand. This study was conducted in Tamilnadu with the primary objective of determining the major attributes that are important to customers while choosing a particular brand of cement. Two types of customer groups are targeted in this study namely, cement dealers & sub dealers and influencers who are Engineers, Builders, Promoters and Architects. The sample size for the study is 150 which consist of 75 dealers and 75 influencers. Random sampling technique is used to draw the samples. ‘Two dimensional factor’ method was employed to map the brand perception of the respondents. The respondents were asked to rank the attributes of cement that influence their choice, out of which top two attributes were extracted. These attributes are then considered to build the perceptual map for various leading cement brands. From the analysis researchers found that ‘Quality’ and ‘Availability’ are the top two attributes ranked by dealers. For influencers, ‘Setting time’ and ‘Strength’ have emerged as top two attributes. The perceptual map indicated that ‘Sankar’ and ‘Dalmia Cements’ brands have a good perception and close positioning in the minds of the respondent groups. © Serials Publications Pvt. Ltd.},

abstract={The rationale behind on the subsidies depends on the fact that they should be distributed equally among the regions and farmers for attaining the objective of rapid growth in agricultural production. But there has been large inter regional disparity in the use of agricultural input subsidies, which has relatively increased over the time periods. The results reveal that 71.25 per cent of respondent farmers view the level of benefits of agricultural input subsidies at moderate level followed by high level [19.25 per cent] and low level [9.50 per cent]. There is significant difference between size of holdings and benefits of agricultural input subsidies. In addition, there is significant difference in receiving benefits from agricultural input subsidies by respondent farmers among the different states. Therefore, it is recommended that the respective authorities should communicate properly about benefits of agricultural input subsidies among farmers and make them to use agricultural input subsidies efficiently. The agricultural input subsidy programmes should be transparent and combined with credit programmes that can allow farmers really benefit from subsidy programmes. © Serials Publications Pvt. Ltd.},

abstract={Wear is a common property exhibited when two materials rub against each other. The present research work aims to investigate the influence of chromium (Cr) on wear characteristics of powder metallurgy (P/M) plain carbon steel (Fe-0.5%C) and to find optimal parameters for minimum wear loss and frictional coefficient of the P/M alloy steels. The sintered-forged plain carbon steel and with addition of 1% and 2%Cr P/M alloy steels were made into cylindrical pins to conduct wear tests as per the standard. The Design Expert (DE) software was used for conducting the dry sliding wear tests. Addition of Cr reduces the mass loss due to the formation of chromium carbides embedded in the ferrite grain matrix in the microstructure. The optimum working parameters found for the minimum mass loss and coefficient of friction from the Taguchi-grey relational analysis are 50 N load and 113.5 rpm speed irrespective of the alloy steels.

For any organization it is important to understand the value of the employees to manage the company or business. The feedback obtained from the survey among the employees can be very helpful for the management to bring some changes in the policies and working condition that motivate employees.

abstract={Aggression is a common issue with students with low emotional intelligence, because they don't have the skills they need to communicate or manage their emotions appropriately. Emotional intelligence is acquired implicitly from family dynamics and by taking part in school, church, and community activities. These aspects, or skills, include self-expression of emotions, conflict resolution, and empathy. Self-expression is a person's ability to communicate how they feel in any given situation. The data were collected based on simple random sampling from Master of Business Administration students from engineering colleges located in and around Trichy. 150 questionnaires were distributed and 136 complete forms were received with 90.7% response rate. The primary data were analyzed using cluster analysis with the help of SPSS package. Therefore it is recommended that appropriate emotional literacy training programs in institutions of higher education should be framed to develop characteristics correlated with efficient leadership related to empathy, stimulating and steering others and conscientiously managing oneself as most relevant for scholastic pursuits. Thus emotional intelligence evaluations are excellent interpreter of leadership expertise and recognize the latent worth of these evaluations being used in the staffing and promotion of scholarly leaders. © Serials Publications Pvt.

In our culture, 'Study' has a religious significance too. Goddess Saraswathi, is considered to be responsible for the gift of studies amongst humans. 'Skills' is an 'ability to do something well'-An expertise. There is a common paradigm between these two words 'study' and 'skills' and, it is the 'devotion' that is anticipated to impart in these two refined qualities into human effort. Study Skills has gained much importance in the field of education, especially in higher studies where it is required for excellence in one's domain. In recent times, students have been exposed to multi fold activities of learning and performing consistently for various occasions that test their caliber. Imparting appropriate study skills among the student community has a socio cultural and socio economic factor that has become inevitable and need to be recorded. Based on these factors and considering the individual acumen of each student the study skill as a strategy varies. Study Skills are transferable.

abstract={Life demands certain qualities in individuals, when confronted with negative situations. It is at those times that the inherent earnestness of an individual is identified. People use a variety of measures to ensure that those negative situations do not make them lose good opportunities and relationships. There are various measures, which are termed as soft skills, which enable people to be successful in both personal and professional life. One such quality is assertiveness, which helps them to have a healthy communication style; by preventing other people take advantage of you and at the same time enable one to have a right to express their feelings and rights without appearing domineering or superior. This study has been taken to know the level of assertiveness among professional students and to suggest suitable measures to improve the same. The study is based on primary data collected by way of administering the RATHUS Assertive Schedule. Random sampling method was used by acquiring data from students pursuing Master of Business Administration in and around Trichy. Out of the 200 questionnaires distributed 183 complete forms were received with 91.5% response rate. The internal consistency of the questionnaire is considered as good as it has Cronbach's Alpha as 0.819. The primary data were analyzed using percentage analysis and ANOVA single factor with the help of SPSS package. Gender does affect assertiveness of the respondents as they perceived that they hesitated to compliment others and accept compliments, because they were shy, irrespective of male or female and urban, semi-urban or rural areas. Similarly, locality does have a relationship with assertiveness towards self, others and situations as they hesitated to engage themselves in group discussions, or were embarrassed to return defective goods. They find that being a single child or having siblings does not make them assertive as they have a hard time saying "No." The relationship between submissiveness and aggressiveness should be adjusted, where they are trained in assertiveness to improve their self-esteem and popularity among peers. It should be emphasized that assertiveness helps one to express themselves effectively and productively without being pushy. This study can be applied by everyone in education, information technology, hospitals, banks and insurance sectors.},

abstract={The paradigm shift in banking sector from branch banking to internet banking has made the banks to think about application of technology in back and front end activities to enhance service quality. This initiative will become fruitful only when the employees are treated as internal customers and they should be motivated to extend quality services to customers. The aim of the study is to evaluate the service quality of HDFC bank as per its employees' perception using the SERVQUAL model. The primary data were collected from 133 customers of HDFC Bank, Tiruchy branch and 116 questionnaires received are complete in all aspects. The data collected were analysed with the help of mean, standard deviation and paired t-Test with the help of SPSS package. It is inferred from the analysis that employees' perceptions were lower than expectations. These negative gaps show that internal service level is below the perception in relation to expectation among bank employees. The service quality dimensions with expectation of tangibles have negative status on the employee satisfaction. This study can be applied to service sector like insurance, tourism, hospitality and hotel to measure acuity of employees.},

abstract={The demonetization announcement has made the buyers to restrict their discretionary purchases like automobiles. Hence the automobile manufacturers have to take extra efforts to attract buyers besides the existing discounts and attractive schemes. Many manufacturers have made a decision of keeping production lines idle to cope up with drop in sales and excess inventory in December 2016. This has reflected in the prices of stocks in automobile sector. The aim of the study is to analyze the impact of November 2016 Demonetisation policy on the share prices of Automobile industry. The impact of demonetization has resulted in the decline of investment made by the investor in short period based on their interest and preference of investing in this industry. Correlation and Regression methods have been applied to the data drawn from the NSE website through SPSS package. Using this method the relation between Auto motive index and share prices of respective companies were analyzed. The share prices of selected companies for a period of 94 days (Pre-demonetisation-47 days; Post-demonetisation-47 days) were considered for the study. Tata Motors Share prices are highly related with Nifty Auto, followed by M&M, Bajaj and Eicher. Maruti Suzuki is least related with Nifty Auto when compared to other selected companies. The results in Pre- demonetisation period are found to be less correlated, except the Tata Motors were correlation value is Positively Strong Correlated. The study can be extended to other sectors Real estate, health, construction and hospitality sectors.},

abstract={Six Regional Rural Banks with 17 branches covering 12 districts were started with the objective of developing the rural economy by promoting agriculture, trade commerce, industry and other productive activities in the rural areas in December 1975. The RRBs suffered overall net loss of 279 crores, 280 crores and 129 crores at the end of March 1996, 1997 and 1998 respectively. At the end March, 2005 166 RRBs secured profit of 903 crore and 30 RRBs suffered losses of 155 crore and net profit was 748 crores. The Credit-deposit ratio was 57 percent and the net Non Performing Assets stood at 5.15 percent. The path of restructuring of RRBs was considered to ameliorate the operational viability of the Regional Rural Banks by taking the advantage of the economies of scale and strengthen the weak banks. The Indian Government initiated the process of structural consolidation of RRBs in 2005-06. As a result of merger, the number of Regional Rural Banks reduced from 196 to 64 at the end of March 2013. The net profit rose to 2,200 cores and the Credit-Deposit ratio increased to 63 percent and the net NPAs reduced to 3.4 percent from 4.84 percent. An attempt has been made in this paper to study whether restructuring of RRBs has really strengthened and repositioned and brought any progress in the performance of RRBs in India. For this purpose the researchers have studied financial results of RRBs before and after merger/amalgamation from 1997-98 to 2012-13.},

abstract={We report on the template electrodeposition of different copper/copper oxide nanoparticles on pencil graphite lead substrate using ionic and neutral surfactant templates. Physical structure and electrochemical properties of the modified electrodes were shown to be influenced by the nature of surfactant template. These copper modified pencil graphite electrodes exhibited very good catalytic activity towards hydrogen peroxide reduction reaction, which could be used for the sensitive and selective detection of H 2 O 2 . A maximum sensitivity of ca. 158 μA/mM/cm 2 , lower limit of detection (LOD) of 0.35 ± 0.04 μM, response time of &lt;2 seconds and a linearity in wide range of concentration from 1 μM to 13 mM were observed. These electrodes were highly selective towards hydrogen peroxide with little interference from glucose, fructose, ascorbic acid, dopamine, uric acid, urea, chlorides, nitrates and sulphates even at 100 fold higher concentrations of the interfering species compared to H 2 O 2 concentration. Practical feasibility of the sensor was demonstrated by detecting H 2 O 2 in human blood serum and milk samples with good recovery. Our methodology enables one to prepare the electrode within two minutes and to complete the analysis within another 60 seconds, enabling the quantitative detection of hydrogen peroxide in less than five minutes using a freshly prepared, cost-effective electrode without any complicated procedure. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Usability forms the stepping stone in measuring the easiness of using any website. In this paper satisfaction obtained by users while using websites of Indian public sector banks is measured based on dimensions such as usability, trust, content, aesthetics and behaviour. Primary data is collected through questionnaire which has 36 questions distributed to 22 active volunteer student users in the age group of 18 to 23 years. Students recorded their opinion for the 36 questions presented in the questionnaire by visiting individual banks website one by one until the entire 27 public sector banks website satisfaction level have been observed. This resulted in 594 total responses. After discarding missing value entries we landed with 532 valid responses. Principal Component Analysis using varimax rotation with Kaiser Normalization was carried out using SPSS to identify the dimensions. Finally structural equation model was analysed using visual PLS. Results indicate dimensions usability, trust, content, aesthetics and behaviour contribute significantly for measuring the level of satisfaction experienced by a user while interacting with websites of Indian public sector banks. © Serials Publications Pvt.

A comparative analysis was made in the current study between India and China on people practicing open defecation in rural and urban areas, its effect on death caused by communicable diseases and the extent to which the practice has been reduced through the health expenditure and conditions of improved sanitations. For the purpose of study, the annual time series data for the period 1990 – 2015sourced from World Bank wereemployed.The result of the cause-effect analysis indicated that the total public and private health expenditure as a percentage of GDP and improved sanitations in rural and urban areas in China hadsignificantly brought down the practice of open defecation and the cause of death due to communicable diseases. In case of India, it was observed that the rate, at which health expenditure and the improved sanitations had been increased, was found inadequate to bring down the practice of open defecation and the cause of death due to communicable diseases. It would be appropriate to admit the fact that the policy-makers, bureaucrats, corporate, public and other organizations have a collective responsibility to improve better living conditions. © Serials Publications Pvt.

abstract={The rapid research on the traditional recommender systems has proved the usefulness of the decision support tools on various real-time applications. In the recent years, hybrid recommendation models have become more popular due to its increased efficiency to manage the information overload problem. The context-aware location recommendations based on user's emotions improves the user satisfaction levels, but still the emotion based recommendation models are not explored completely due to the real-time issues in the acquisition of the user's emotions. This article presents an effective recommendation model for the location recommendation through exploiting the emotion of the user from online social media. In the proposed model, User, Point-of-Interest and User's Emotion during travel are the three main factors taken into consideration to generate recommendations. The proposed location recommendation models correlate the positive and negative impact of the user's emotions to generate the list of user relevant locations. The developed models are evaluated on the large-scale real world datasets and obtained results were compared with the existing baseline models. The presented results prove the improved efficiency and accuracy of the proposed location recommender system through validation by standard evaluation metrics.},

Engineers need to be creative and innovative but the present day engineering education does not cater to igniting the brain to take up challenges and problems and come up with creative solutions. Student engineers are loaded with more of theoretical and conceptual courses which drain of their energy and interest in evolving something new. In industrialised nations the government and educationists are exploring ways and means to inculcate and develop creativity and innovative problem solving skills in the students pursuing engineering curriculum. This has permeated engineering students to venture into many start-ups and very many are succeeding. Creative ideas though may be stupid initially, in due course with proper description and processing evolve to be a better thing than what was expected. The profession of Engineering ought to be a creative profession but students often are of the opinion that creative behaviour is not encouraged in their classes and teaching. This study aims to understand the kind of creativity that is present in the engineering graduates working in Information Technology sector. The study has been focused on the employees of software industry residing at Chennai, the Tier I city and Coimbatore, the Tier II city and the primary data were collected through the distribution of a pre-tested research questionnaire. Among the five levels of creativity as identified by Taylor it was analysed and found that the engineering graduates working in IT firms were proficient in expressive and technical creativity but lacking in other levels namely inventive, innovative and emergent creativity.},

This disclosure of insightful data violates individual privacy. In order to achieve privacy many privacy preserving techniques have been proposed recently and one such technique to preserve privacy is to use various operators in genetic algorithm (GA). In this paper we compare the various mutation techniques in genetic algorithm and their appropriateness to achieve data privacy. From our experimental results it is evident that the outcome of the mutation process depends on various parameters such as type of data and the binary pattern used for replacement. © RJPT All right reserved.},

abstract={Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to originate a statistical model for delamination factor, surface roughness, machining force and also to determine and compare the effects of machining parameters (spindle speed, fiber orientation angle, helix angle and feed rate) on the output responses during end-milling of glass fiber reinforced polymers (GFRP) by using desirability functional analysis (DFA) and grey relational analysis (GRA). Design/methodology/approach - Based on Taguchi's L27 orthogonal array, milling experiments were carried on GFRP composite plates employing solid carbide end mills with different helix angles. The machining parameters were optimized by an approach based on DFA and GRA, which were useful tools for optimizing multi-response considerations, namely, machining force, surface roughness and delamination factor. A composite desirability index was obtained for multi-responses using individual desirability values from DFA. Based on this index and grey relational grade the optimum levels of parameters were identified and significant contribution of parameters was ascertained by analysis of variance. Findings - Fiber orientation angle (66.75 percent) was the significant parameter preceded by feed rate (15.05 percent), helix angle (7.76 percent) and spindle speed (0.30 percent) for GFRP composite plates. Originality/value - Multi-objective optimization in end-milling of GFRP composites using DFA and GRA has not been performed yet. © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The centre fuselage of an aircraft plays a very crucial role as most of the important parts such as the front fuselage, aft fuselage and the wings are connected to it. So any load applied on these parts will be transferred to the centre fuselage. Hence it was essential to study the centre fuselage briefly in order to attain high design safety. Fatigue is the process of repeated cyclic loading of a component, which leads to an early failure of the same. The sources of fatigue in an aircraft are the parts connected to it, such as the wings, and the differential pressure between the inside of the fuselage and the outside atmosphere as a result of cabin pressurization. The high pressure inside the fuselage tries to expand the fuselage, whereas the stringers and bulk head prevent it from happening. This change in pressure happens frequently and this results in the fatigue of the centre fuselage. The vibratory loads acting on the other parts are transferred to the centre fuselage, which are also major contributors to the fatigue. The centre fuselage of an aircraft was designed using Pro-E software. The standard aluminium alloy was selected for the material. The various loads acting on the centre fuselage were studied and added to the centre fuselage, along with a differential pressure in a cyclic manner.},

abstract={In biomedical, objective of the semantic web is a pillar to connect plenty number of related data for information. Human and machine readable is the main theme behind web of science. Open linked data is the guideline for merging concepts, location and persons. Existing work is employed on Resource Description Framework (RDF) for machine learning purpose, GRDLL, POWDER, R2RML and SHACL are the existing work available in the market. The limitations of RDF for manipulating the data is not providing intellectual information retrieval, SPARQL is the query language playing a vital role. RDF is a lightweight and not possible for creating negative ontology. It is not holds good for negative expressions, cardinal values and metadata. The proposed methodology consisting of try model: (i) Backward chaining methodology in artificial intelligence; (ii) OWL-RDF is an intellectual query retrieval and (iii) Open linked data is used for obtain information’s from heterogeneous sources. It concludes Web Ontology Language (OWL) is the logic based language with a fine interoperability in web contents and always expresses the clear meaning. Using different biomedical datasets HCUP, data.gov, healthdata.gov, HMD, SEER, MHOS, DRUGBASE, and so on, open linked data consume information through the technique called OWL choreography. © 2017, Scientific Publishers of India.

abstract={This paper proposes a new scientific decision framework (SDF) under interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy (IVIF) environment for supplier selection (SS). The framework consists of two phases, where, in the first phase, criteria weights are estimated in a sensible manner using newly proposed IVIF based statistical variance (SV) method and, in the second phase, the suitable supplier is selected using ELECTRE (ELimination and Choice Expressing REality) ranking method under IVIF environment. This method involves three categories of outranking, namely, strong, moderate, and weak. Previous studies on ELECTRE ranking reveal that scholars have only used two categories of outranking, namely, strong and weak, in the formulation of IVIF based ELECTRE, which eventually aggravates fuzziness and vagueness in decision making process due to the potential loss of information. Motivated by this challenge, third outranking category, called moderate, is proposed, which considerably reduces the loss of information by improving checks to the concordance and discordance matrices. Thus, in this paper, IVIF-ELECTRE (IVIFE) method is presented and popular TOPSIS method is integrated with IVIFE for obtaining a linear ranking. Finally, the practicality of the proposed framework is demonstrated using SS example and the strength of proposed SDF is realized by comparing the framework with other similar methods. © 2017 R.

This principle is implemented using alternate converter topologies viz SEPIC converter or Z- source converter at the front end of the six-pulse inverter. Both the converters are capable of regulating the DC link voltage over a considerable range so as to control the motor speed in a closed manner. Simulation of entire drive system in MATLAB/SIMULINK platform covering both the converter configurations are presented and compared.

abstract={In this work, we report for the first time a chemoswitchable mesoporous silica nanocarrier encapsulating methylene blue photosensitizer for photodynamic therapy against breast cancer. We have successfully demonstrated that tumor-specific release of the hydrophilic photosensitizer methylene blue in combination with laser irradiation at 670 nm to MCF-7 cancer cells efficiently induced reactive oxygen species and subsequent cell death. Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MCM-41) with spherical morphology were synthesized using sol–gel method and were surface functionalized with 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane (MPTMS) by evaporation-induced self-assembly. The thiol groups underwent spontaneous oxidation forming disulphide bonds thereby retaining the methylene blue molecules in the pores for a longer time. The unmodified and thiol-functionalized mesoporous silica samples were characterized using electron microscopy, spectroscopy, and surface analysis. The chemo-responsiveness of the thiol-functionalized samples was demonstrated by the addition of the thiol reducing agents glutathione and β-mercaptoethanol. In vitro studies revealed that the thiol-functionalized samples exhibited greater cytotoxicity on irradiation with laser when compared to their unmodified counterparts and free drug. As the levels of GSH in normal cells are considerably low, our results indicate that this chemoswitchable system may be an effective strategy to induce cancer cytotoxicity.

MANET is one of the most promising wireless network architectures. It is dynamic nature in terms of movement of mobile nodes leads to frequent link failure. The establishment of communication is very challenging due to the active mobility of nodes. This may be due to several reasons like hardware crash or software problems and nodes that move away from the particular network. Link failure in a particular network aborts the transmission of data from the source to the destination which leads to performance degradation of the network. A wide variety of network protocols have been proposed for instantaneous re-routing of the packets by considering several parameters.

This survey studies the evolution of implementation of genetic algorithm principle in robot path planning to real multi objective genetic algorithm. The classical approaches may produce the best solution for the given problem space which consumes the huge amount of computational power and memory. The computational complexity in turn time complexity increases proportional to the complexity of environment and configuration of robot. Whereas it is evident from the research domain, the heuristic approaches emerged with better approaches to overcome the disadvantages of the classical approaches. The genetic algorithms playing the important role in finding solution like robot path planning which are considered as NP-hard problem. The refinement in the Genetic Algorithm lead through the another leap in robot path planning considering all the objective functions as fitness functions instead of one of the objectives as fitness function and other objectives are added as constraints. The Multi Objective Genetic Algorithm implementation is generating the challenging performance either with some variations in the implementation or with hybridization of other methodologies.},

As indicated by these patterns, expanding test information volume is viewed as a potential overhead in the testing business. In this paper, another test information Compression technique based on Referenced Bit Reserve Scheme with Bit Masking (RBR) Code is displayed. The essential motivation of Bit-Mask is to make a record of confounded qualities and their respective positions to pack unique number of guidelines; this could be utilized only or joined along with the reference directions for unraveling the code words. In this work, a reference set with variable veil numbers are connected, which were used with the RBR calculation to decrease the code word length with increased recurrence directions. Additionally, a novel RBR choice calculation was proposed to expand the guideline coordinate rates. For this procedure, an RBR calculation is intended to lessen the calculation time of encoding calculation. This coding strategy encodes 2n perfect or contrarily better instance into just one test data portion or multiple experimental data portions. The recreation result demonstrates that the compression ratio and calculation time is decreased. From the analysis of Experimental inferences indicate that the propounded RBR technique enhances a compression ratio and a test time on International Symposium on Circuits and Systems '89 circuits in multifarious cases compared to the inferences of the previous work without a substantial burden on the hardware. © IAEME Publication.},

abstract={Cloud computing [1] is a distinctive field to overcome the hardware needs by storing and accessing the data over the internet. This technique allows the users to pay only for the workloads and resources they use. The main issue about the cloud is providing security [9] while accessing the data. There are many attacks [2] in this environment. As the cache memory is permanent, there is a possibility that high value data may reside in it as residual memory. One such could happen in cache of the cloud system also. Attack focusing such data is termed as cache involved side channel attack. This attack focus on recovery of key or any valued information that is used for encryption and decryption rather retrieving the plain text and cipher text. The advantage of cloud computing is scalability and used to store any kind of data remotely. The idea here is that the cloud's architecture is liable to be influenced by side channel attack and such attack in the cloud cannot be overcome by conventional means without disturbing the cloud model. There are two solutions to solve this muddle. Sequential side channels and parallel side channels are the techniques. These techniques must be enacted inside the hypervisor of the cloud system. These secure hypervisors are designed in such a way that they do not interfere with the cloud model and bears less overhead. © IAEME Publication.},

abstract={Cloud computing has become a major part of our daily lives as almost every application that we use uses cloud services. Hence it is implicit that the reliability and security of a cloud service be mandatory. To ensure smooth operation in cloud, the possibility of a failure is predicted by means of a proactive prediction mechanism. In this paper,Hybrid Failure Prediction (HFP) mechanism is proposed by incorporating statistical and machine learning methods for predicting the Virtual machine failure in proactive manner.The average CPU utilization of a virtual machine (VM) to compute the expected utilization value upon addition of tasks to that VM by calculating the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA). This expected value is compared to a threshold (T), which is a measure of the actual capability of the machine. The results are validated using various machine learning techniques to ensure that the VMs predicted for potential failures have tasks that tend to over-utilize CPU resources. The tasks that were to be run on a machine that may fail can be either delayed until the machine regains stability or may be run on a different machine which has the capacity to incorporate that task without causing the machine to fail. © IAEME Publication.},

abstract={Web caching plays a very important role in improving the speed of web page access and also to reduce the bandwidth usage. In browser level caching the browser contains its caching mechanism which is isolated from any other browsers present in the Local Area Network (LAN). The browser access pages either using local cache or from the web server. The mechanism increases access time if the cache has not been available in the local system. In this proposed system, Local Area Network level caching has been introduced to access caches from other nodes in the LAN. The LAN computer nodes have been programmed with Bloom filters to access necessary caching information. The proposed system has been tested for single node-multiple requests and multiple node-multiple requests scenarios. The experimental results show that the technique is very efficient for browsing the web on the slow connections as the transfer in the LAN will be fast. The proposed system outperforms regarding access time for accessing the web page. © IAEME Publication.},

abstract={From ancient times images are being used for varying reason from personal to scientific to research. For that, Images needs to be either stored or transmitted across the network to other party. Due to security reasons, intended users may not store or transmit the image as plain. But if images are subjected to encryption, the resultant image is always a noise like and, there will always be a suspicion by the unintended third person. To avoid suspicion, optimization is done on the encrypted image to make them visually meaningful. The proposed method is to split a single color image into three images, i.e., Red image, Green image and Blue image which are encrypted separately and later merged into a single color image and then wavelet transformation is applied to render the encrypted image visually meaningful. Based on the experimental results, the proposed method is rated good on visual perceptibility of encrypted image and proved to be superior over other methods. © IAEME Publication.},

abstract={The major issue due to nodes mobility in mobile ad hoc network is link failure. Though, different methods have been proposed for fast re-routing of the packets by considering the hop count as the parameter, they still lack in end to end delay. Hence, we propose Instant Route Migration protocol, which constructs the path instantaneously considering the path distance and hop count. We have implemented the partial topology aware mechanism in order to find the shortest path rapidly. This involves cache maintenance at every node for re-routing packets to the destination in case of link failure. Our proposed solution achieves maximum throughput, less end to end delay and provides instant route migration than the existing systems. © IAEME Publication.},

abstract={Now-a-days the data is expanding rapidly in terms of volume, veracity, velocity, variety etc. This exponential growth of data is the result of evolution of social web which in turn led to increase in usage of online services by people to consume and generate data in real time. This growing data is not only structured and semistructured but unstructured as well, which is the main reason behind the lack of useful information from this vast amount of data. So, here arises the difficulty in choosing relevant items of specific category like movies, products, music, books etc., so here comes the Recommender systems with its new and emerging technologies that makes the work of users easy in choosing the most relevant and appropriate among this big data. The heart and source for these recommender systems is the information provided by users in social websites. The techniques implemented in these recommender systems run around the idea of recommending the users based on their taste in preferences, historical information and past activities, on the attributes of user and also on behavioural patterns of all other users. This procedure is known as Collaborative Filtering. This is a mostly used technique which provides recommendations based on the demographic attributes of the users such as age, gender, occupation etc., and also based on the similarity with the other users. This Procedure also uses ratings given by users as feedback which also plays an important role in recommending. So in this project we generate quality recommendations from vast amounts of data using the methodologies of various techniques discussed above. Our recommendations in this project are limited to movies.},

It is the top most preferred techniques when implementing recommendation systems. In recent times, more interest has turned towards GPU-based parallelized hybridization design implementation of filtering algorithms. The concurrent way of solving any problem is preferable to everyone nowadays. The objective of GPU-based parallelized hybridization design is to produce recommendations in parallel and combine the results. We have proposed Parallel Weighted Hybridization Design (PWHD) method which combines the results of different recommendation system generated using Parallel User Based Collaborative Filtering (PUBCF) and Parallel Item Based Collaborative Filtering (PIBCF).We have evaluated all these methods with standard evaluation metrics.

abstract={Information in the internet is evolving in terms of high volume through different sources. Extracting tuples from HTML pages has been an important issue in various web applications such as web data integration, e-commerce market monitoring, and mash ups that repurpose and selectively combine existing web data services. Data Mining is the process of analyzing data from different perspectives and summarizing it into useful information. Text Mining uses many applications of Data Mining. Text Mining is the discovery of unknown information by automatically extracting and relating the information from different resources. Text is classified based on the content that is used for mining. It is done based on comparing the text documents with the database. In the existing system, techniques like named entity recognition, information retrieval, information extraction and knowledge discovery are used for text mining. Google used page rank method to retrieve and rank the documents. However, Google rank may not provide the documents with the most relevant information. In the proposed system, information retrieval is used to collect many web documents and pre-processing the web documents and extract the text data. Then a word is identified as bio medical entity or not by using a Database with medical keywords. The page containing more bio medical words is ranked first. More relevant documents can be obtained by re ranking the documents using medical database.},

abstract={Mobile ad hoc networks are infrastructure less network, mostly used during the time of crisis. Ad hoc networks are deployed where setting up of fixed access points and backbone infrastructure are not viable. The topology and the host of the network changes frequently. Data must be routed via intermediate nodes. These networks are vulnerable to security threats. One such threat is the blackhole attack. On receiving the data, blackhole just drops the data without informing the source and the destination. Monitoring the lost traffic or the ongoing traffic can be the solution to uncover the effects of blackhole. This paper involves proposing a solution to detect and isolate the blackhole node using a technique called Neighbour Coverage. The proposed technique detects the compromised node using bogus data and finds an alternate route from the source to the destination as a blackhole node acts as an intermediate node. Thus it terminates the packet loss and ensures secure transmission of data. © IAEME Publication.},

abstract={Traditional image search engine provides images based on textual words associated with them. Multiple images have textual words in common. Therefore, the search engine displays images which are also not relevant to user's needs. Hence, this search provides some irrelevant images which lead to non-optimal image search. So, image search based on textual words remain major disadvantage of the existing search engine. Aiming at reduced memory usage and more likely to provide an ideal and better image search, this paper employs the concepts of image feature extraction, hashing techniques, hamming space calculation and relevancy retrieval of images. Query image and all other images in the database are subjected to feature detection and extraction. Features are manipulated to binary hash code, where they can be made as reference to each image. Images are ordered by the hamming distance calculated from hash code. The most relevant images are then retrieved as per user's query image. It can be employed for various applications such as entry check, that uses images rather than finger print recognition or even in guest detector in houses or offices and much more. © IAEME Publication.},

abstract={The utilization of heat transfer fluids with improved specific heat and thermal conductivity will be beneficial for enhanced energy collection in solar thermal systems. Accordingly, hybrid nanofluids comprising ZnO nanoparticles and encapsulated paraffin wax in propylene glycol-water mixture were prepared and characterized. The influence of encapsulated paraffin wax concentration (4–16 wt. %) and ZnO nanoparticle concentration (0–2 vol %) revealed that the thermal conductivity and specific heat could be improved to a maximum of 10.4% and 18.7% respectively, in comparison with those of propylene glycol-water mixture, at their appropriate concentrations. The presence of ZnO nanoparticles was found to influence the phase change characteristics of encapsulated paraffin wax, in such a way that the latent heat due to phase change was increased at an optimum concentration of ZnO nanoparticle concentration. While the maximum enhancement in overall heat transfer coefficient of 15.37% was obtained for the hybrid nanofluid sample that had both thermal conductivity and specific heat higher than the base fluid, the maximum enhancement in heat transfer rate (13.54%) was obtained for the hybrid nanofluid that had 18.65% enhancement in specific heat. The results of present investigation reveal the potential of hybrid nanofluids for energy management. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

The reason behind attacks is that common intermediate medium which transmits information in wireless medium are very much susceptible to Denial of Service attacks. Unlike the traditional Internet DoS attack which comprises of staggering service requests to the host, in wireless networks constrained bandwidth and routing functionality combined with nodes which lead to fresh opportunities for dispatching DoS attacks and impersonation attacks. Here, it is suggested that a key establishment scheme to encounter Denial of Service attacks. This is essential in securing communications in a wireless environment. The proposed scheme comprises of three stages, namely key-sharing, key-detection and route establishment. In IoT environment the sensor nodes are distributed and the end user should obtain the authenticity to ensure the competence of security for accessing a node in the network.

abstract={Background and Objective: Cryptococcus neoformans (C. neoformans) is an emerging opportunistic fungal pathogen, which usually causes infection in immunocompromised hosts. Limited antifungal drugs are available to manage cryptococcal meningitis, which requires new effective class of drugs with less toxicity. The aims of the study were to enhance the production of antifungal compound from a new strain of marine Nocardiopsis synnemataformans AF1 against C. neoformans using statistical approach, to determine the molecular weight of the purified compound and to evaluate the effect of antifungal compound against the major virulence factors of C. neoformans, namely capsule and melanin. Materials and Methods: A new strain was screened and isolated from marine sediments based on antagonistic assay against C. neoformans. The antifungal compound was produced using Oyster shells as the substrate. The solid state cultural conditions were selected by one factor, time method and optimized by using response surface methodology. The antifungal compound was extracted using xylene and purified using HPLC. The purified fraction showing inhibitory action against the C. neoformans capsule growth and melanized cells were studied using MALDI-TOF MS. The minimum inhibitory concentration was determined using dilution method. Cytotoxicity was observed by HepG2 cell line. One-way ANOVA and t-test performed to test statistical significance for multiple comparisons. Results: The optimized condition to produce the antifungal compound from the new strain AF1 are found to be, 50% initial moisture content, 2% yeast extract, Oyster shells with the particle size of 16 and temperature at 40°C. The antifungal compound exhibits a significant reduction in C. neoformans cells, capsule size (30.18%) and melanized cells (99.3%). The MIC for the purified compound is estimated to be 200 µg mL-1. The MALDI-TOF MS estimated the molecular weight as 242 Da. Conclusion: The results of this study show that the new strain N. synnemataformans AF1 isolated from marine environment exhibited potential antagonistic activity against C. neoformans. © 2017 Sudarshan Singh Rathore et al.},

abstract={The consumption of melamine and urea contaminated cow milk causes indigestion, acidity, ulcers and kidney stones in humans. In this context, a highly sensitive acetylcholinesterase cyclic voltammetric biosensor based on zinc oxide nanospheres modified Pt electrode has been successfully developed for the simultaneous determination of melamine and urea in cow milk sample. The fabricated bioelectrode showed 100% permeability to the binary mixture of melamine and urea, which in-turn enhanced selectivity. In addition, linear regression models for the estimation of binary mixture of melamine and urea in cow milk were formulated by keeping added melamine and urea as dependent variables and the estimated electrochemical paremeters as independent variables. The prediction performance of linear regression models was validated using %recovery, relative prediction error and root mean square error for cross-validation. The developed Pt/ZnO/AChE/Chitosan bioelectrode detected melamine and urea over a range of 1-20 nM with a limit of detection of 3 pM and 1 pM respectively. The proposed sensor exhibited good recovery (99.96-102.22%), thus providing a promising tool for analysis of melamine and urea in cow milk samples. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={It is intuitive to understand how sensory information gets to the brain and how motor information can travel to the muscles together where these two systems allow us to detect and respond to the world around us but how do we engage with that world, how do we determine what is important, and how do we fall in the analysis. These higher cortical functions involve the complex interplay between neurotransmitters and hormones throughout the entire nervous system. There are two major anatomical behaviors; the limbic system and hypothalamus. These structures that support much higher cortical functions hypothalamus is a very small structure but it is absolutely critical for life and it allows us to respond to both the internal and external environment and to maintain homeostasis. The limbic system is important for learning and memory, and all emotional aspects of behavior importantly limbic and hypothalamic structures are interconnected with each other. Let’s begin with an anatomical overview of the hypothalamus in the middle section. You can delineate the hypothalamus from the thalamus through the hypothalamic sulcus anteriorly, the hypothalamus extends to the anterior commissure, and the optic chiasm inferiorly and it includes the mammillary bodies and extends to the infundibula stock where it communicates with the pituitary glands. It is a coronal section through the brain. It is the third ventricle, you can identify the thalamus on either side of the third ventricle and underneath; the thalamus is the hypothalamus and it extends laterally to these descending fiber bundles which are part of the internal capsule. The hypothalamus is structurally part of the diencephalon but it functions as part of the limbic system through reciprocal connections. It helps to maintain homeostasis in the entire body through influences on the endocrine system and importantly through its primary influence on both the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems; the limbic system is extremely old from an evolutionary perspective in its connections and it is interposed between the hypothalamus and the neocortex and providing a bridge between endocrine visceral emotional and voluntary responses to the environment. © 2017 The Authors.},

abstract={Economical attention in the field of steel structures is gaining importance over the years and has motivated researchers for the development of many algorithms, such as : Genetic, Particle Swarm, Artificial Bee Colony,… etc. These algorithms aim at achieving optimal design of truss structures. In this paper, Differential Evolution Algorithm with discrete design variables is applied to optimize the design of plane truss structures. Optimization of trusses aims at reducing their weight; i.e., in search of a most economic section. The optimum values for cross-sectional areas of truss members are to be such that they minimize the structural weight of truss, without violating the constraints. The constraints are a specified range of area, as well as deflection and stress values with upper and lower limits which have to be satisfied by each and every individual member of the truss. Fitness values are calculated for the population from the objective function derived and penalized if the constraints are violated. The process of differential evolution starts with an initial population and continues until the termination condition is satisfied. C++ programming language is employed for efficient operation. To study the efficiency of Differential Evolution Algorithm applied to truss optimization, five plane trusses are designed. When compared with manually designed truss structures, the result of DEA is found to give robust and superior truss structures. Final results show that the optimized weight of trusses obtained is 30% less than that of the same truss designed manually. Ultimately, a common DEA applied program to optimize any plane truss is developed and optimal F and CR values are found. © 2017 JUST. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={In this study, a facile method to synthesize non-toxic copper sulfide nanoparticles was reported, and the antibacterial activity of the nanoparticles in infected zebrafish was evaluated. Transmission electron microscopy showed that the CuS NPs are spherical in shape with a size range from 10 to 25 nm. FTIR spectra revealed that the CuS NPs were stabilized by N-lauryltyramine. CuS NPs exhibit very good antibacterial activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, and the minimum inhibitory concentration was determined as 12.5 μM. In vitro mechanistic studies revealed that CuS NPs kill the bacteria by damaging their cell membranes and producing reactive oxygen species. Therapeutic activity of CuS NPs was tested in bacteria-infected zebrafish. The route of administration of CuS NPs was via an injection and medicated bath. Both routes of drug administration were suitable to cure the fish from bacterial infection. Bacterial colony count assay revealed that the CuS NPs depleted the infectious bacteria from the fish body within 24 h. Strikingly, CuS NPs in concentration eight times than the MIC did not show toxicity in the liver and brain of zebrafish. Moreover, the NPs exhibited good hemocompatibility with human red blood cells. Our study demonstrated for the first time that CuS NPs are a safe antibacterial agent, and medicated bath with zebrafish is a hassle-free model for testing the antibacterial activity of nanoparticles. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

The measurement of the liquid film thickness in two phase flows is prominent in various heat and mass transfer applications such as in boilers. To determine the thin film thickness is the aim of this study. A glass tube of diameter 4.7 mm is used for conducting the experiment and a laser pointer is used to obtain an image pattern on the screen. Using the principles of Optics, a method has been proposed to determine the thin film thickness and also to characterize the different types of flow. The thin film thickness obtained in the proposed method is validated using Image Processing.},

abstract={Background: Epilepsy causes when the repeated seizure occurs in the brain. Electroencephalogram (EEG) test provides valuable information about the brain functions and can be useful to detect brain disorder, especially for epilepsy. In this study, application for an automated seizure detection model has been introduced successfully. Materials and Methods: The EEG signals are decomposed into sub-bands by discrete wavelet transform using db2 (daubechies) wavelet. The eight statistical features, the four gray level co-occurrence matrix and Renyi entropy estimation with four different degrees of order, are extracted from the raw EEG and its sub-bands. Genetic algorithm (GA) is used to select eight relevant features from the 16 dimension features. The model has been trained and tested using support vector machine (SVM) classifier successfully for EEG signals. The performance of the SVM classifier is evaluated for two different databases. Results: The study has been experimented through two different analyses and achieved satisfactory performance for automated seizure detection using relevant features as the input to the SVM classifier. Conclusion: Relevant features using GA give better accuracy performance for seizure detection. © 2017 Journal of Natural Science, Biology and Medicine | Published by Wolters Kluwer-Medknow.},

This study explores the implementation of fault-tolerant systems using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan images with image enhancement algorithms. If some of the pixels in the image become faulty or erroneous, the accuracy of the information is lost and hence the necessity of fault-tolerant systems would be more important. The high-pass filters are used here to obtain edges in the images with hardware redundancy techniques like Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) which are used to tolerate one single event error. The 5-MR methods are also explored to tolerate two errors. This is a kind of case study demonstrates with producing high frequency content even from the blurred input image. These biological systems are implemented on Altera EP4CE115F29C7 FPGA device using Quartus II synthesis software tool.

abstract={The present investigation is focussed on to develop and study the densification and deformation of cold forged pre-alloyed ATOMET 4601 and admixed with 2% TiC high strength alloy steels. Elemental TiC powder was homogeneously mixed with ATOMET prealloyed powder through Powder Metallurgy (P/M) route. The physical properties of P/M alloy steel powders were measured as per the ASTM Standards. The cylindrical sintered preforms of size ł25x12 mm were used for the present work. In order to study the plastic deformation and densification characteristics of the alloy steels preforms, the specimens were subjected to cold upset with an incremental load. The axial load was increased upto the appearance of fine cracks on the lateral surface of the deformed alloy steel preforms. Physical measurements have been taken on deformed and undeformed specimens to calculate stress and strain values. The density of specimens was evaluated by the Archimedes' principle for the as sintered and the specimen after each deformation. The influencing parameters such as true axial stress, true height strain, true lateral strain, density and hardness were correlated each other for the deformation and densification studies of the alloy steels. Microstructures of alloy steels taken by optical microscope were also corroborated with deformation properties. It is found from the plots that addition of TiC to prealloyed powder deteriorates the plastic deformation and densification properties of ATOMET 4601 alloy steel. The titanium carbides embedded between the ferrite gains drastically affect the plastic flow of TiC added alloy steel.},

abstract={M2 polarization of macrophages is predominant in case of tumors and some other infectious diseases for disease progression. Repolarization of the M2 phenotype to the M1 state may be required to cure diseases. Hence, it is of great interest to find out a material that would repolarize the M2 phenotype to the M1 state. Herein, the arabinogalactan protein from Andrographis paniculata (ApAGP) was used to prepare a silver nanoparticle-ApAGP (SNP-ApAGP) bioconjugate, which was characterized via UV-vis spectroscopy, zeta potential analysis, FT-IR spectroscopy, and HR-TEM. Studies suggest that SNP-ApAGP (2.5 μg mL-1) up-regulates ROS generation, NO generation, and pro-inflammatory cytokine release (IL-12, IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-6). SNP-ApAGP also down-regulates the arginase-1 activity and anti-inflammatory cytokine release (IL-4 &amp; IL-10) in M0, M1, and M2-polarized peritoneal macrophages in vitro. Therefore, SNP-ApAGP induces M1 polarization in M0 macrophages, enhances the pro-inflammatory activity of the M1 phenotype, and can also repolarize M2 macrophages into the M1 phenotype. Therefore, SNP-ApAGP could be used for treating various infectious diseases and cancers where repolarization of M2 macrophages may be required to cure the disease. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={Mechanical properties and band structure of rhombohedral BiFeO3 nanostructures were studied using density functional theory for different pressures in the range from 0 to 50GPa. The elastic constant of BiFeO3 nanoceramics was determined and different moduli were calculated for various applied pressures. The bulk (B) and shear (G) modulus show an increasing trend on applied high pressure. The findings of the present work also confirm that the hardness of BiFeO3 increases with the applied pressure. The ductility of BiFeO3 nanostructure increases upon increasing the pressure, which is confirmed from Poisson's ratio and B/G ratio. The band structure studies were also carried out under high pressure and showed that the band gap decreases upon increase in the applied pressure.},

abstract={The variations in impact strength of self-compacting concrete reinforced with recycled Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) Pieces were examined using Weibull reliability analysis. For this purpose, the experimental results of an earlier research were investigated statistically using the two parameter Weibull distribution. The shape and scale parameter of Weibull distribution function was determined from five statistical methods namely Least-Squares (LS) regression of Y on X, Least-Squares (LS) regression of X on Y, Empirical Method (EM), Energy Factor Pattern Method (EPM) and Graphical Method (GM). The Weibull parameters were used to describe the impact strengths (number of blows required to cause first crack and failure) in terms of reliability. Further, regression equations were developed between the impact strength and reliability of self-compacting concrete reinforced with recycled CFRP Pieces. In order to validate the developed linear regression equations, six reliable statistical indicators namely Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD), Integral Absolute Error (IAE), Relative Root Mean Square Error (RRMSE) and Relative Percentage Error (RPE) have been used. Results suggested that the LS- X on Y, EM and EPM are more effective to estimate the Weibull parameters. The developed linear regressions equations which were validated by six statistical indicators show a good fit and higher accuracy. © 2017, Fundatia Serban Solacolu. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Increase in environmental pollution, energy scarcity, depletion of fossil fuels and to secure future fuel supply, the need of non petroleum based alternative fuels becomes essential. These alternative fuels are used to increase the efficiency and reduce adverse effect of green house gases. Owing to high octane rating, liquified petroleum gas (LPG) proves to be more efficient than petrol mixed with methanol up to 2 ml/min which is used as an alternative fuel in this study. This alternative fuel can be used in the SI engine with slight modification in the fuel supply system. The experiments are conducted in 4-cylinder, 4-stroke petrol engine with bi-fuel activated by the solenoid. The actuator diverts LPG through the vaporizer kit to the carburetor. The flow rate of LPG is calculated using suspended weighing scale. Liquid methanol enhances the LPG prior to the vaporizer kit due to gravity. The vaporizer kit is heated by engine hot water which results in temperature raise in LPG vapour thereby methanol gets evaporated. The petrol engine is initiated by LPG and run by a mixture of LPG and methanol by reducing the LPG flow. The operating characteristics of engine are investigated with varying the quantity of methanol and LPG. The thermal and mechanical efficiencies are found to be increasing with the addition of methanol, whereas the specific fuel consumption and the emission characteristics such as CO, CO2, HC and NOx are reduced. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2017.},

abstract={Optimization is proved proficiency method, which is used for finding required process conditions to give the maximum or minimum value of the function. A new metal based alloy with a defined composition of Copper (84%) Aluminium (12%) Nickel (4%) is proposed. The powder has synthesized by a powder metallurgy process for the production of near net-shaped components through mechanical alloying. It is more complex to attain the properties in the making of materials for marine applications. The main objective of this study was to obtain an alloy compact with high density and hardness and consider a set of optimal process parameters like sintering temperature, holding time and compaction pressure. The alloy has a set of desired properties to suit the needs of the marine applications, porous material filters and electric friction equipments. The combination of Cu–Al–Ni offered in marine applications like rotary hydraulic actuator, hydraulic tube due to high mechanical strength, good corrosion resistance. Copper, Aluminium and Nickel powders are mixed by ball milling equipment and compacted at pressures 550, 590 and 630 MPa using Universal Testing Machine (UTM). These compact specimens have been sintered in an electric muffle furnace at temperatures 640, 695 and 750 °C at different holding times of 30, 60 and 90 min. The L9 orthogonal array was designed with the combination of input factors and their levels. The experiments were conducted at each level to measure the maximum hardness and density. Grey Relational Analysis was applied to find the optimum input parameter configuration. ANOVA was adopted to determine the level of significance of input factors. Confirmatory experiments were done to verify the optimal results. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2017.},

The electronic transport properties of NiFe2O4 nanowire are studied in terms of density of states, transmission spectrum and I-V characteristics. The density of states gets modified with the applied bias voltage across NiFe2O4 nanowire device, the density of charge is observed both in the valence band and in the conduction band on increasing the bias voltage. The transmission spectrum of NiFe2O4 nanowire device gives the insights on the transition of electrons at different energy intervals.

abstract={DNA damage analysis plays an important role in determining the approaches for treatment and prevention of various heritable diseases. Comet assay or single-cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) is a method recognized for studying DNA damage in a single cell. Comet assay images were collected from PubMed by searching with the keyword “Comet Assay”. Various steps involved in analyzing the images were removing artifacts, counting comets, labelling comets, partitioning comet into head and tail, calculating area and intensity. Finally the percentage of DNA damage was calculated. We created a standalone tool named “CoMat” for the detection and quantification of DNA damage by processing the comet assay images using MATLAB and VB.Net platform. The user interface was created using VB.Net platform for uploading an image file and saving the calculated parameters in an Excel file. The MATLAB code functions for analyzing the images were written in the MATLAB code editor and a VB.Net extension was created by adding MATLAB function files to Classes under Build.NET Assembly in the MATLAB environment. The created Dynamic-link library (dll) extension was then added as a reference for Visual Basic for executing MATLAB functions through VB.Net. CoMat can process different types of image formats such as JPEG, TIFF, BMP, and PNG. The tool removed unwanted gel artifacts and background noises efficiently. It is also capable of analyzing both silver stained and SYBR green stained images by converting them into grayscale images. It will be able to process only if the image is of higher resolution. The calculated area and intensity values were stored as a cell array in MATLAB which was then exported into an Excel sheet. The results predicted by CoMat were accurate and it was an efficient standalone tool for analyzing DNA damage in a single cell using comet assay images. © 2017, Pharmainfo Publications.

abstract={Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to find out the optimum machining parameters using Taguchi technique with principal component analysis (PCA) during end milling of GFRP composites. Design/methodology/approach - In multi-objective optimization, weight criteria of each objective are important for producing better and accurate solutions. This method has been employed for simultaneous minimization of surface roughness, cutting force and delamination factor. Experiments were planned using Taguchi's orthogonal array with the machining parameters, namely, helix angle of the end mill cutter, spindle speed, feed rate and depth of cut were optimized with considerations of multiple response characteristics, including machining force, surface roughness and delamination as the responses. PCA is adopted to find the weight factors involved for all objectives. Finally analysis of variance concept is employed on multi-SN ratio to find out the relative significance of machining parameter in terms of their percentage contribution. Findings - The multi-SN ratio is achieved by the product of weight factor and SN ratio to the performance characteristics in the utility concept. The results show that a combination of machining parameters for the optimized results has helix angle of 35°, machining speed of 4,000 m/min, feed rate of 750 mm/rev and depth of cut of 2.0 mm. Originality/value - Effect of milling of GFRP composites on delamination factor, surface roughness and machining force with various helix angle solid carbide end mill has not been analysed yet using PCA techniques. © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Objective: This study intends to operationalize brand equity and form a standard measure of it that could be used across cosmeceutical products to measure brand equity. It attempts to provide an indication of a set of items that can contribute to brand equity. Methods: A survey instrument containing the said brand equity concept was administered to a sample pool of 200 select beauticians and consumers of a leading Indian Cosmeceutical brand identified using stratified random sampling method, from among the universe of the users of the product in Tiruchirappalli district, Tamil Nadu. Results: The results obtained confirm that the dimensions, viz., brand awareness, perceived quality, brand loyalty, brand association, and brand image were found to significantly contribute to brand equity in cosmeceutical products. The regression confirms that perceived quality and brand associations are not causal drivers but are only indirect drivers of brand equity. Further, the dimension perceived quality was very strongly related with both brand loyalty and brand image, and brand loyalty was very strongly related with brand association among the beauticians segment of the sample. In the case of the brand equity dimensions among consumers, the brand association was very strongly related with brand awareness, perceived quality, and perceived quality was very strongly associated with the brand image. Conclusion: The outcomes of the study confirm that cognitive components of perceived quality and brand association were less contributing to brand equity and the affective component of brand loyalty had stronger underpinning on brand equity construction and hence play an important role in brand management. The brand equity structure gives a very good clarification of brand equity drivers and also their relationships, to formulate a cause and effect model. The model can form a basis for more action-based tactical and operational marketing strategies. © 2017 The Authors.},

abstract={The theory of reference frames and switching functions are effective in analyzing the performance of the induction motor fed from VSI (Voltage Source Inverter). In this work, mathematical model of Adjustable Speed Drive (ASD) is developed by taking synchronous reference frame equations for induction motor, switching function concept for VSI and non-switching concept for diode bridge rectifier. Simulation model of induction machine is implemented using dq0 axis transformations of the stator and rotor variables in the arbitrary reference frame. The corresponding equations are given in the beginning and then the developed model is implemented using MATLAB/Simulink. In this work, the proposed model is implemented using basic function blocks. The performance of induction motor is analysed for different frequencies. The developed model is tested for the steady state behavior of machine drive. The proposed mathematical model is validated by the simulation results. Copyright © 2017 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The use of fibers to strengthen materials, which are weak in tension, goes back to ancient times. Nowadays, many types of commercially available corrosion free fibers are being used to reinforce cement concrete, thereby improving the behaviour of structural elements. Even though extensive investigations have been conducted to study the behaviour of steel fiber reinforced concrete (SFRC) and polypropylene fiber reinforced concrete (PFRC), the use of jute fibers, which are locally available in large quantities, has not received much attention and studies reported so far are old and few. The present study focuses on the use of jute fibers in improving flexibility and ductility properties in concrete and has been carried out to investigate the feasibility of developing jute fiber reinforced concrete (JFRC) using jute fibers varying from 0.15 to 0.6, by volume. To improve the concrete toughness, a small fraction of short fibers and fly ash (0 to 30% by weight of cement) was added to the concrete mix. fibers provide resistance to crack propagation and crack widening before being pulled out or stressed to rupture. Tests were conducted on different specimens with optimum fiber parameters and results are compared with those normally used for reinforced concrete specimens. © 2017 JUST. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={This study describes the development of performance and emission characteristics on partially stabilized zirconia (PSZ) coated diesel engine fuelled by biodiesel with cetane number enhancing additive of Di-tertiary-butyl peroxide (DTBP). Additive was added to biodiesel in 1% by volume. The biodiesel was prepared from palm oil using simple base catalyst transesterification process. Biodiesel with additive and petroleum diesel were used as the test fuels. The experiment was conducted on a single cylinder, four stroke, water cooled and direct injection coated engine and to determine the performance and emission characteristics of engine running on the test fuels. The results were compared to uncoated engine, running on test fuels. The thermal efficiency for biodiesel with additive fuel was found to be comparable to diesel fuel operation at part load and slightly higher at rest of the load in coated condition. Exhaust emission measurements showed that NOx levels could be significantly reduced using biodiesel with additive fuel compared to diesel fuel in the same experimental conditions. There was no significant improvement on performance and emissions (except HC and CO) of uncoated engine running on biodiesel with additive fuel. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Purpose: Wheelchair users face great difficulty in transferring themselves from one surface to another, for example from wheelchair to a toilet commode. In such cases, mostly a caregiver’s assistance may be required, but it affects one’s dignity. The purpose of this paper is to develop a robotic self-transfer device, which is aimed at offering privacy and independence to people with lower limb disabilities in performing daily activities. Design/methodology/approach: The device, attached to a powered wheelchair, is useful in transferring a user from a wheelchair to a toilet commode or any other surface following simple and natural transfer procedure without the need of any caregiver. The user can achieve transfer by operating joysticks. The device employs two linear actuators and a motor to accomplish the transfer. Trials were carried out to test the performance of the device by involving potential beneficiaries. Findings: The device could successfully transfer the participants from a wheelchair to a chair with less effort in less than a minute. The results of the trials show that the participants felt comfortable in using the device. It was also found that the device is superior to other existing transfer systems in terms of comfort and operation. Originality/value: The existing self-transfer systems are alternative solutions that serve the purpose of mobility coupled with self-transfer. Instead of developing an alternative mobility solution, this paper proposes a novel design of a self-transfer device that can be used as an attachment to wheelchair. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Allowable stress design (ASD) factors mentioned in Section J10, AISC Specification (AISC 360-10) have been used. The stresses in web and stiffeners due to axial loading from brace are computed based on the dispersion parameters and compared with FEM analyses done using Abaqus. Allowable strength is calculated as per the provisions in the code. The results indicate that local yielding of web and stiffeners govern the design of tubular brace to I beam joints considered in the study.},

abstract={Geopolymer concrete (GPC) is the best alternative greener material to the existing cement concrete which is most expensive, resource and energy consuming. Geopolymer technology not only has the potential to reduce global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions caused by ordinary Portland cement (OPC) production, it also has exceptional mechanical and durability properties. Until in recent times, the comprehension of structural GPC was exceptionally inadequate; moreover there is no prescribed codal provision for mix proportioning of geopolymer concrete. With the intention of overcome the limited resource of structural behavior of GPC, this work was proposed to assess the effect of tension reinforcement percentage (1.0, 1.5 & 2.0) and shear span/depth (1.9 & 2.9) on the flexural behaviour of reinforced alkali activated slag concrete beams with ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) as source material. The properties such as load carrying capacity, flexural strength, moment carrying capacity, deflection and ductility behaviour of six RGPC beams were experimentally evaluated using two-point loading and the results were compared with the existing codal provisions (BS 8110, BIS 456, ACI 318). The results infer that the experimental value shows superior performance than the predicted values prescribed by the codes. © IAEME Publication.},

abstract={The behavior of SiO2 and metakaolin in an aggressive environment, when used separately as a supplementary cementitious material, was studied for three different replacement levels: 5%, 10%, and 15%. SiO2 and metakaolin were used in two states, namely unground and ground (ultra-fine). Ultra-fine state was achieved by subjecting the mineral admixtures to grinding in a planetary ball mill for an optimum period of one hour. The microstructure of the unground and ground mineral admixtures was studied using Scanning Electron Microscope and X-Ray Diffraction. The compressive strength of these systems in normal and aggressive environments was tested after initial curing in water for a month, and another subsequent curing in acid or base environment for a period of three months to arrive at the rate of deterioration. The rate of corrosion in rebars was also determined using Half-cell potential method. The results obtained from the tests were compared with control concrete. Based on the results, it was understood that concrete with 10% ground SiO2 and 5% ground metakaolin provided better resistance to deterioration and corrosion. It also exhibited improved microstructure as well as filler action. Comparing the results of the two admixtures, performance of concrete with ground metakaolin was found to be better than that of ground SiO2. © 2017 Sharif University of Technology.

abstract={In order to detect a weld defect using machine vision techniques, it is necessary to ascertain occurrence of noise and estimate the noise level in a weld X-radiography image. In general, noise, particularly, Gaussian or normal noise, appears in an image during the image acquisition process. While implementing image-processing techniques, the presence of Gaussian noise in an X-radiography image degrades the desired result. Therefore, we should ensure the presence of noise in the test image. To solve this problem, this study proposes a new scheme in which a single image can be taken instead of two, i.e., an original noise-free and a noisy image. We employed the anisotropic diffusion technique proposed by Perona-Malik for image smoothing and noise level estimation using standard deviation. The standard deviation between the input and smoothened image confirms the presence of noise in the test image. The proposed scheme delivers accurate results, irrespective of the presence or absence of noise, and estimates noise level. © 2017 Pushpa Publishing House.},

abstract={Digital images are foremost way of communication in the modern world but the images may possibly noisy due to acquiring process. To ensure the image quality and visibility, image denoising or noise reduction is important process in the image preprocessing techniques that is image restoration. Weld X-radiography images are generally having characteristics such as low-contrast, noisy and small size of feature space. It is necessary to improve the quality of the image for accurate feature extraction. Noise reduction is the challenging task in the denoising process without disturbing of features. An anisotropic diffusion is the famous method for image denoising. This paper studies various anisotropic diffusion based denoising methods and are experimented on noisy weld X-radiography images. Finally, the performance of the methods is evaluated by Mean Square Error (MSE) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) measures. This performance analysis steps forward for further experiment of image segmentation and feature extraction process on noisy weld X-radiography image. © 2017 Pushpa Publishing House.},

abstract={Intake of water contaminated with lead (Pb 2+ ) and mercury (Hg 2+ ) ions leads to various toxic effects and health issues. In this context, an amperometric urease inhibition-based biosensor was developed to detect Pb 2+ and Hg 2+ ions in water matrix. The modified Pt/CeO 2 /urease electrode was fabricated by immobilizing CeO 2 nanoparticles and urease using a semi-permeable adsorption layer of nafion. With urea as a substrate, urease catalytic activity was examined through cyclic voltammetry. Further, maximum amperometric inhibitive response of the modified Pt/CeO 2 /urease electrode was observed in the presence of Pb 2+ and Hg 2+ ions due to the urease inhibition at specific potentials of −0.03 and 0 V, respectively. The developed sensor exhibited a detection limit of 0.019 ± 0.001 μM with a sensitivity of 89.2 × 10 −3  μA μM −1 for Pb 2+ ions. A detection limit of 0.018 ± 0.003 with a sensitivity of 94.1 × 10 −3  μA μM −1 was achieved in detecting Hg 2+ ions. The developed biosensor showed a fast response time (&lt;1 s) with a linear range of 0.5–2.2 and 0.02–0.8 μM for Pb 2+ and Hg 2+ ions, respectively. The modified electrode offered a good stability for 20 days with a good repeatability and reproducibility. The developed sensor was used to detect Pb 2+ and Hg 2+ ions contaminating Cauvery river water and the observed results were in good co-ordination with atomic absorption spectroscopic data. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Risk management is a concept which becomes very popular with a number of businesses. The demand for infrastructure is going to be in great volume in the coming future. Use of modern construction equipment's and techniques has accelerated the growth. As the industry grows the associated risk also grows. Risk management in construction is an important area needing attention for successful completion of the project. Many companies often establish a risk management procedure in their projects for improving the performance and increase the profits. Construction projects are complex in nature with significant budgets, making reduction of risks the main focus. The questionnaire prepared for the survey was formulated by seeing the relevant literatures in the area of construction management. This research seeks to identify the risk factors that affect the performance of small, medium and large construction projects, using appropriate tools and technique and to develop a risk management framework. For doing various analyses, we collected 180samples in small, medium and large construction firms. The responses were analysed by reliability & validity, rank correlation using the software of SPSS. This model enables to know the strategies that propose risk prevention, risk relocates future suggestion. A risk free project is one with some reasonable profit for the parties involved and zero dispute condition. A well-drafted, balanced contract with a proper administration can mitigate exposure to risk and keep the project on track. Construction Managers must nullify the impacts of the contingencies of risk with their specific contractual, financial and organizational requirements. In order to achieve this balance, proper Risk identification and Risk analysis is required. This study investigates, categorizes and evaluates the risk and develops a risk management policies and guidelines to the company contractor which can be adopted at the construction project site for better and risk free construction work. © IAEME Publication.},

abstract={Objectives: Today water is a scarce & precious commodity and it is emerging as a demand everywhere. Most of water is wasted when people don't turn off the faucet out of laziness or negligence. People leave water running, while brushing one's teeth or forgetting to shut the tap after the bathtub has been filled. To avoid wastage, sensors are fitted and the automatic operation of the sensors controls the wastage. This paper focuses on studies of the amount of water spent daily and reduces the consumption of water In order to save considerable amount of money as well as energy resources. Methods/Analysis: Drip calculators is a device installed, and it measures that a faucet releasing three drops a minute wastes appx 1 ml of water and more than 1.4 litres per day or approximately 511 litres per year. The adoption of automatic faucets, sensor urinals and low flow aerators make considerable amount of water savings as well as a cost-effective solution for water crisis. Equipped with motion sensors, automatic faucets only turn on and release water if a person is detected. Once the sensor determines that no one is in front, the valve closes automatically. In order to find the cost effectiveness, a Theatre in Trichy named as La cinemas have been studied. Findings: By installing these devices Initial cost is more but it's a better approach for effective water saving measures. The benefits of automatic faucets are not only limited to (i) Water conservation but also helpful for people with Mobility problems; (ii) Reduce the risk of disease transmission (iii) saving in water Cost and Energy Conservation. The finding focuses on eradicating the water demand in Academic institution and to estimate the total percentage of savings in water and to have healthy environment. Applications/Improvement: It can be practically adopted for urban and semi urban belt. The cost incurred for transportation and Diesel consumption can be minimized. Further this technique can be recommended in public buildings in order to have economical water system. © IAEME Publication.},

abstract={Lifetime ofWireless SensorNetwork (WSN) is an important issuewhich affects its implementation in various real time applications. The major factor behind the energy consumption inWSN is its data collectionmechanism.The direct data transmission fromeach sensor node to the Base Station (BS) consumes more energy than other alternatives. Also it is unnecessary, due to redundant data transmission because of geographically closer nodes. Clustering is the best data collection architectural model for WSN since it takes care of in-network processing which handles redundant data within the network.The techniques used for the network having uniform node distribution are not suitable for the networks which have nonuniformly distributed nodes. This paper contributes a novel clustering algorithm: Fuzzy Logic Based Energy Efficient Clustering Hierarchy (FLECH) for nonuniformWSN. The clusters in FLECH are created using proper parameters which increases the lifetime of the WSN. Fuzzy logic in FLECH is wisely used to combine important parameters like residual energy, node centrality, and distance to BS for electing best suitable nodes as CH and increases the network lifetime. FLECH performance is verified in different scenarios and the results are compared with LEACH, CHEF, ECPF, EAUCF, and MOFCA.The simulation results clearly indicate the lifetime increase by FLECH over other algorithms and its energy conservation per round of data collection in the network. © 2017 Baranidharan Balakrishnan and Santhi Balachandran.},

abstract={The quality of exported canned citrus sinensis and citrus limetta degrades slowly owing to the excess liberation of methanol from the pectin of canned citrus sinensis and citrus limetta. To detect the methanol liberation, an electroactive inorganic-organic nanocomposite modified working electrode was fabricated by immobilizing reduced graphene oxide/ferricyanide (rGO/Fe(CN)6 3−) on the surface of Pt electrode via chitosan membrane. The electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol by Fe(CN)6 3− was observed at the anodic potential of 243 mV (vs Ag/AgCl), which was shifted negatively to almost 36 mV when compared with that of direct electrochemical oxidation of Fe(CN)6 4− in the Pt/Chitosan/rGO/Ferricyanide electrode.

abstract={Self-compacting concrete (SCC) is treated as a special concrete in modern applications due to its passing ability, filling ability and resistance against segregation. SCC has a significant role to play in the areas of mass concreting, like pier construction, foundation,… etc. In addition, it is also preferred for light-weight concrete structures; namely, precast members. In the present paper, a sincere attempt was made to study the effect of metakaolin (MK) on high-strength SCC. For this purpose, SCC with a characteristic compressive strength of 60 MPa was used with four different percentages of MK to replace cement, ranging from 5% to 20% with an increment of 5%. Fresh properties, such as slump flow, passing ability and filling ability, as well as mechanical properties, such as compressive and tensile strengths, were studied. Compressive strength was found to be higher for SCC with 20% MK. Split tensile strength was higher for MK with 10% replacement of cement. The correlation equation and root mean square value (R2) were obtained for the relationship between cube compressive strength and cylinder axial compressive strength to determine the best fit, respectively. © 2017 JUST.

abstract={Evidences suggest that the presence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with cerebrovascular diseases related cognitive decline in dialysis patients. As mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated in neurodegenerative disorders, we hypothesized that changes in brain mitochondria occur due to vascular calcification induced by renal failure and the opening of the mitochondrial potassium channel using nicorandil may prevent its dysfunction. Brain tissues from rats with vascular calcification were studied. Nicorandil (7.5 mg/kg b.wt.) was given either concomitantly or after the induction of calcification. The brain tissues were evaluated for antioxidant capacity, mitochondrial enzymes and oxidative phosphorylation efficiency along with the progression of calcification. The results suggested that renal failure, elevated the calcium, phosphorus product in the brain. The brain cytoplasm and mitochondrial fractions showed an elevated TBARS and a corresponding decline in the antioxidant enzymes, indicating a severe oxidative stress. The elevated brain mitochondrial enzymes like NADH dehydrogenase, and succinate dehydrogenase in the disease control groups, reversed to the near control level after nicorandil treatment. We observed that nicorandil was more effective when given after calcification. It reduced the biochemical alterations associated with calcium and phosphorous toxicity in the brain, by preserving mitochondria, the key target for treating neurodegenerative diseases. © 2017, Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology.

abstract={This work focusses on a new, efficient energy detection based spectrum sensing and in addition mitigating the threats of the physical layer of cognitive radio. The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the energy detection method is concatenated with Gould transform. Concatenated approach along with proper choice of windows and its size resulted in improved probability of detection and improvement in signal to noise ratio. Many new classes of security, threats and challenges may be introduced in Cognitive Radio (CR) where attackers could destroy the fundamental function of cognitive radio network and may cause interference to primary users which is not desirable or may deny the licensed spectrum of Primary users (PU) to other secondary users by surpassing PUs in cognitive radio. This is called the Primary User Emulation (PUE) attack. This paper concentrates on dipping the primary user emulation attack by means of an authentication technique. This is achieved by embedding an authentication tag in the error control code, specifically turbo code. This tag is based on chaotic Pseudo Noise (PN) sequence algorithm and Katayapadi algorithm and the same has been implanted in Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). © 2017, Scientific Publishers of India.

abstract={Physical and chemical properties of groundnut oil and mustard oil are studied at different concentrations of two antioxidants Tocopherol and Tert- Butyl Hydro Quinone (TBHQ). Classification of vegetable oils in terms of their usage safety, stability in transport, easy reuse characteristics and overall health benefits is vital to categorize them for quality. Hence, to increase the shelf life of oil in cooking and pipelining, vegetable oils are added with different concentration of antioxidants to improve the permanence. Properties like viscosity, relative density, electrical quality factor and acid value are analyzed with the addition of antioxidants. Variation of viscosity with temperature for different concentration of oil was observed. Empirical equations like Wright's ASTM Equation and Akerlof - Oshry's relating viscosity with temperature are computed and compared and Wright model (R2 = 0.999-0.995) is highly correlated. The experiential value of relative density and acid value show good variation with the addition of tocopherol even below 10 mg/100 mL and random variations with TBHQ. The present study also states that addition of TBHQ to groundnut oil do not produce any synergistic effect with the antioxidant in the oil and also do not impede the oxidation reaction effectively.},

abstract={Nowadays, the most important study to provide confidentiality is digital image encryption. More and more proposals have been committed to inquire about Visual Secret Sharing (VSS) techniques. Traditional scheme was mainly focused on binary images and later investigations were extended to grayscale and color images. Visual cryptography encodes the secret information into n shares and distribute among of group of participants. Qualified participants can reconstruct the original image by superimposing the collected share images. Regrettably, the previous schemes still have weakness during the construction of secret shares and reconstruction on secret image. In this paper we present a reversible visual cryptography technique for color images using Galois field theory. A secret image is split up into two sub images and shared by the cover image to construct the stego images. Additionally Galois field theory is applied to construct brother stego images for effective transmission. Individual stego and brother stego images reveal nothing. The Galois field inverse operation of exponential is employed to reveal the secret image and pair of pixels in the brother stego images reveals cover images. © 2017, Scientific Publishers of India.

abstract={The attainment of security level in telemedicine communication systems might be a sensitive research area because of its content confidentiality. The proposed Intrusion Detection System (IDS) research work presents a model for detecting attempts of attacks to acquire unauthorised access to a web based telemedicine system. The process of attacks detection would be performed by applying Conditional Random Field (CRF) based approach because of its structured prediction feature. The proposed mechanism deals with structured prediction approach and hence it is suitable for identifying the attacks over the web based telemedicine application. From the experimental observations, the proposed scheme offers high efficiency with accuracy in terms of detecting the attacks (Probe, R2L, U2R and DoS). This model presents proficient results over the medical data communication in terms of efficient attack detection time, false alarm rates along with good classification accuracy. © 2017, Scientific Publishers of India.

abstract={Nanofluids, engineered colloidal dispersions of solid nanoparticles in liquid, belong to new category of heat transfer fluids that have evinced intense research activities in the recent past. Metal oxides have been widely used as solid phase for nanofluid formulation owing to their advantages such as relatively lower density, chemical stability and ease of preparation. This review paper resumes the research carried out on metal oxide based nanofluids: preparation, thermo-physical properties, the molecular level mechanisms influencing the transport properties and the testing of nanofluids for cooling applications. The influence of nanofluid formulation and physical parameters such as nanomaterial morphology, temperature, pH, additives, and the viscosity of base fluid on the transport properties of nanofluids has been reviewed. The physico-chemical interactions between the metal oxide nanoparticles and the molecules of the base fluid play an important role in determining the thermal conductivity and viscosity of the colloidal dispersions. Hence, desirable thermo-physical properties of nanofluids can be achieved by engineering the interactions between the metal oxide nanoparticles and the base fluid molecules by adopting appropriate formulation strategy. Scale-up of preparation of nanofluids is still a challenge and needs to be addressed, upon which the use of nanofluids as heat transfer fluids in solar thermal applications, industrial cooling, thermal management in fuel cells, etc. can be accomplished. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Purpose - This study aimed to develop a mathematical model for delamination and surface roughness during end milling by using grey relational analysis (GRA) and to determine how the input parameters (cutting speed, depth of cut, helix angle and feed rate) influence the output response (delamination and surface roughness) in machining of hybrid glass fibre-reinforced plastic (GFRP) (abaca and glass) composite using solid carbide end mill cutter. Design/methodology/approach - The Four factors, three levels Taguchi orthogonal array design in GRA is used to conduct the experimental investigation. The Shop Vision inspection system is used to measure the width of maximum damage of the machined hybrid GFRP composite. The Shop Handysurf E-35A surface roughness tester is used to measure the surface roughness of the machined hybrid GFRP composite. "Minitab 14" is used to analyse the data collected graphically. Analysis of variance is conducted to validate the model in determining the most significant parameter. Findings - The GRA is used to predict the input factors influencing the delamination and surface roughness on the machined surfaces of the hybrid GFRP composite at different cutting conditions with the chosen range of 95 per cent confidence intervals. Analysis on the influences of the entire individual input machining parameters on the delamination and surface roughness has been conducted using GRA. Originality/value - Effect of milling of the hybrid GFRP composite on delamination and surface roughness with various helix angle solid carbide end mill has not been analysed yet using the GRA technique. © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme has been predominantly used for the detection of pesticides and metal ions. But, these sensors respond to pesticides as well as metal ions at certain concentration, which results in poor selectivity. Hence in this work, the amount of thiocholine produced during AChE inhibition has been estimated to detect the residual activity of AChE enzyme in-turn to enhance the efficiency of the biosensor. In this context, Pt/ZnO–CeO 2 /AChE/Chitosan based biosensor has been developed for sensitive voltammetric quantification of thiocholine in AChE. The sensor exhibited enhanced electron transfer rate, good conductivity and biocompatibility. Both the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters were simultaneously optimized using second order polynomial regression to get the best conditions for ATCh determination. Under optimized experimental conditions, the redox peak current was linear over the concentration range of 0.1–1.5 mM with detection and quantification limit of 0.05 and 0.15 μM respectively and the sensitivity of 1.47 μA mM −1 . © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Human effort is an integral part of any organization. The success of the project is directly influenced by the candidates involved in the project. Due to the constraint of time and cost, selecting the right candidate for the task is a key factor to be investigated. Researchers have proposed different optimization model for achieving the task. But, all these models consider the input vector to be a known parameter. With the help of this vector, knowledge is derived. In this paper, we deviate from the traditional setup and make efforts to analyze the input with the help of known pattern. The pattern is generally binary in nature. We propose a novel research model that uses Expectation Maximization (EM) and Maximum Likelihood (MLE) approaches for evaluating the input vector. We test the model over a personnel evaluation setup in Startup Company. Finally, results from confusion matrix infer that, the proposed model is effective in guessing the right personnel for the project. © 2006-2016 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).

From the work we have studied, we found that a Steiner tree with bounded Steiner vertices offers a good solution. A novel algorithm to construct a Steiner tree with vertices and bounded Steiner vertices is proposed in this paper. The algorithm finds a path from each source to each destination at a minimum cost and minimum number of Steiner vertices. We propose both the sequential and parallel versions. We also conducted a comparative study of sequential and parallel versions based on time complexity, which proved that parallel implementation is more efficient than sequential. © 2017 KIPS.},

abstract={The foremost intention of data mining is to extort unfamiliar patterns from huge set of data. There is a marvellous escalation in the quantity of data anthology with the rapid growth in technology. In recent years, with the advancement in information technology many hospitals started storing various information related to patients in the electronic format commonly referred as Electronic Health Records (EHRs). If used rightly EHRs can precisely identify diseases and add to the effectiveness of healthcare delivery. Quality of treatment given to the patients can be still improved if these records are shared among various hospitals. The key obstruction in data sharing is the sensitive medical information existing in the EHR. The revelation of sensitive data results in privacy breach of individuals, which results in the usage of many privacy preserving techniques. This work is provoked with the necessity to mutually guard private information and facilitate its use for research purpose. In this paper we present a new approach for generating noise to preserve privacy using a neural network. The pseudo identifiers in the data set (EHRs) are used as the input to the network nodes. Output generated by the neural network is added with the original data to generate the sanitized data. We have compared the output of the proposed method with the existing approaches and it seems too superior to the existing methods. © 2017, Scientific Publishers of India. All rights reserved.},

When some of the nodes are overloaded and other nodes are moderately or even under loaded, the process of load balancing redistributes the work load. By this means, utilization of resources and response time can be enhanced. Numerous algorithms are available for dynamic load balancing. Based on the current position of the system, these algorithms make the load balancing decisions. Several factors such as performance indices, load estimation, amount of information exchanged among nodes, load levels comparison, system stability, choosing remote nodes, and estimation of resource requirements should be taken into account.

abstract={Background: There have been discussed several data hiding techniques in an image which can embed the data in secret manner. However, after retrieving the secret data from an image, the original cover image information is not possible to be reconstructed. It is an important issue to have a lossless data hiding scheme which can reconstruct the original cover image without any loss after extracting the secret data. Materials and Methods: In this study a novel idea is introduced for lossless data hiding using adjacency pixel difference. Results: Here histogram is drawn for the pixel difference and secret bits are embedded only in the peak point of the histogram and tested on five gray scale cover images. Conclusion: In this method good amount of secret data can be embedded with high PSNR value. © 2017 R. Anushiadevi et al.},

abstract={The applications of Bubble column reactors in gas-liquid multiphase reactions are widely observed in process industries. Biochemical reactions such as wet oxidation and algae bio-reactions are carried out in bubble column reactors. In this article, an image processing based comprehensive algorithm is developed to identify the trajectory of bubbles in a bubble column reactor. Photographs of bubbles moving up in a bubble column reactor are recorded for different velocities using a high speed camera. An algorithm is developed to plot the trajectory of the bubble. The developed algorithm can be used with experimental and numerical results to trace the trajectory of bubbles. The algorithm is applied to the results of volume of fluids (VOF) simulation to identify the bubble path in Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids. Based on the algorithm, numerical results obtained on Newtonian fluids are used to train an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to find the temporal position of the bubble. Superficial fluid velocities, nozzle diameter and time are the input parameters. The trained Levenberg-Marquardt based neural network can find the position of the bubble at any instant of time. The designed algorithm can study the dynamics and position of a bubble in process applications carried out in a bubble column reactor. © 2017 by De Gruyter 2017.},

abstract={Autism spectrum disorder is becoming a global challenge as the number of children affected by it increases drastically. Autistic children suffer from impairments such as social interactions, language and communication skills, cognitive skills and psychomotor skills. A number of technological systems have been put to use for training children with autism. The children’s attraction towards robot and robot like features promotes the use of assistive technology in rehabilitating autistic children. This paper focuses on teaching psychomotor skills to autistic children by employing a robotic training kit. The scope of the training includes learning the concept of directions and the ability to operate a joystick so as to manipulate the robot as per given instructions. Training and trials were conducted under the supervision of a speech therapist. The study demonstrated the positive response of employing the robotic kit in imparting the knowledge of directions, hand–eye coordination and palmar grasp. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={Cardiotoxins (CTXs) are principal toxic components of snake venoms and the protein toxins exhibit a wide range of biological activities such as systolic heart arrest, membrane depolarizations and lysis of erythrocytes by interacting with components on cell membranes. In the present study, lead chemical inhibitors to the CTX1 (an S-type CTX from Naja naja) and as well to the CTX VI (a P-type CTX from Naja atra) were screened by means of high-throughput virtual screening method. Despite similar three-dimensional folds of the protein toxins, they showed differential binding interactions with the chemical molecules and the differential binding interactions could be attributed to the differences in the structural contexts of the surface regions for the two protein toxins. Moreover, a comprehensive analyze on the data suggested that compounds such as Tricyclene, Myrcene, Physagulin D (1->6)-β-D-glucopyranosyl-(1->4)-β-D-glucopyranoside and Forsythoside would act as lead inhibitors to the CTXs. And, implications of the study for designing small molecular inhibitors to the CTXs of snake venoms are also concisely discussed. © 2016 Pharmainfo Publications. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The reduction in specific heat commonly encountered due to the addition of nanoparticles to a heat transfer fluid such as propylene glycol-water mixture, can be overcome by co-dispersing surfactant-encapsulated paraffin wax, leading to formation of a hybrid nanofluid. Experimental investigations have been carried out on the preparation and evaluation of thermophysical properties of a hybrid nanofluid containing pluronic P-123 encapsulated paraffin wax (70–120 nm diameter, 1–5 wt.%) and sand nanoparticles (1 vol%) in propylene glycol-water mixture. The comparison of results of differential scanning calorimetry of pure paraffin wax and encapsulated paraffin wax revealed encapsulation efficiency of 84.4%. The specific heat of hybrid nanofluids monotonously increased with paraffin wax concentration, with 9.1% enhancement in specific heat for hybrid nanofluid containing 5 wt.% paraffin wax, in comparison to propylene glycol-water mixture. There exists an optimum paraffin wax concentration (1 wt.%) for the hybrid nanofluid at which the combination of various thermophysical properties such as specific heat, thermal conductivity and viscosity are favorable for use as heat transfer fluid. Such a hybrid nanofluid can be used as a substitute for propylene glycol-water mixture in solar thermal systems. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Targeting tumor metabolism by natural products is a novel approach and provides rationale for anti-cancer drug discovery. The present study aims to explore the impact of morin and/or esculetin on c-myc induced energy metabolism in 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) induced colon cancer in rats. In order to achieve this aim we analyzed the expression of glucose and glutamine transporters and the key enzymes of glycolytic pathway besides the markers of neoplastic changes viz., mucin depleted foci (MDF), beta catenin accumulated crypts (BCAC), and markers of cell proliferation viz., proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), argyrophilic nucleolar antigen (AgNOR), c-myc, c-jun and c-fos. All the parameters tested in the present study are highly influenced by the phytochemicals morin and/or esculetin in a way to prevent colon carcinogenesis. Morin and/or esculetin supplementation effectively targets tumor metabolism via β-cateinin/c-myc signaling and affects glycolysis and glutaminolysis to abrogate colon cancer in rats. The anti-cancer effect of morin is more pronounced than esculetin. The effect obtained through the combined treatment of morin and esculetin is comparable to that of individual supplementation of morin and there is no synergistic effect. Overall individual supplementation of morin scores well as a potential anticancer agent targeting glycolysis and glutaminolysis in colon cancer. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Multistep model of colon carcinogenesis has provided the framework to advance our understanding of the molecular basis of colon cancer. This multistage process of carcinogenesis takes a long period to transform from a normal epithelial cell to invasive carcinoma. Thus, it provides enough time to intervene the process of carcinogenesis especially through dietary modification. In spite of the in-depth understanding of the colon cancer etiology and pathophysiology and its association with diet, colon cancer remains a major cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Phytochemicals and their derivatives are gaining attention in cancer prevention and treatment strategies because of cancer chemotherapy associated adverse effects. Being the largest group of phytochemicals traditionally used for medicinal purpose in India and China, terpenoids are recently being explored as anticancer agents. Anticancer properties of terpenoids are associated with various mechanisms like counteraction of oxidative stress, potentiating endogenous antioxidants, improving detoxification potential, disrupting cell survival pathways and inducing apoptosis. This review gives a comprehensive idea of naturally occurring terpenoids as useful agents for the prevention of colon cancer with reference to their classes, sources and molecular targets. Based on the explored molecular targets further research in colon cancer chemoprevention is warranted. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Welding of powder metallurgy (P/M) materials continues to be challenging due to the complexities in terms of thermal and metallurgical processes as a result of porosity. Though fusion welding may reduce or totally eliminate porosity levels in the weld zone, metallurgical changes in the heat-affected zone (HAZ) and PMZ may pose problems relating to strength of the welded joints. The present research work aims to study the mechanical and metallurgical changes in a sinter-forged pre-alloy Atomet 4601 (Fe-0.54 % molybdenum (Mo)-1.8 % nickel (Ni)+0.3 %C) low alloy steel subjected to tungsten inert gas (TIG) welding. Green cylindrical compacts were sintered in a nitrogen-purged muffle furnace at a temperature of 1120 °C for 20 min and subjected to cold upsetting to get various densities of specimens. TIG welding was performed on the forged alloy steel plates with suitable filler material. The TIG-welded alloy steel was subjected to tensile and micro hardness tests, in addition to micro-examination and SEM fractographs of the fractured surfaces. Weld metal porosity has been observed in the case of parent metals with lower density. Increasing the density of alloy steel is found to enhance the tensile strength of parent metal and welded joint of alloy steels—partly due to absence of weld metal porosity. Formation of lamellar acicular ferrite at the fusion zone makes the welded joint stronger than the parent metal. The SEM image of fractured surface reveals brittle mode of fracture of the welded joint during tensile testing. © 2016, Springer-Verlag London.},

abstract={In oil exploration data centers, the seismic exploration process employs multiple applications that are highly specific and replaceable. In addition, the various software versions depend on a particular version of the operating system. As the server purchase from different times, the operating system is also different, with the server scrapped, the newly purchased server operating system version is higher than the original server, resulting in the original application software that cannot be used further. To solve this problem, the software life cycle needs to be extended an independent application software resource pool with a hardware system that is required to be built. Herein, the Docker containerization technology has been used to construct seismic and geologic software pools in a virtualized manner. Furthermore, the hardware and software have been separated from each other, and the hardware resources have been allocated to each container using a scheduling algorithm. By runtime start speed comparison, the physical disk usage comparison test proves that the seismic software has the advantage of being lightweight through the container, and by the analysis of effect of application on conventional module, it proves that the software running in the container has a good effect and is available independence and concurrency. The analysis of the resource-scheduling effect of the scheduling algorithm works well. Thus, we confirmed that the proposed method is effective and has a good promotional value. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Safe-deposit box is a medium that can be used to store one or more valuable objects. Safes have a function to protect valuables from theft or robbery. At the beginning of the discovery of safes, used only in the form of a safety lock. However, as the development of the times found some features that can be used on safes to secure objects in the safe. Eg fingerprint detector, or better known by the name of fingerprint, password and buzzer. Fingerprint is a feature where this feature using the authenticity of a person's fingerprint, in this case the owner safes. Password is a password that can be input via a keypad. Of course, this password is only known to the owner of a safe and can be changed periodically. While the buzzer is a marker of when the safe was forced open by thieves or robbers.Safes used in this final project is controlled by mikrontroler named Arduino Uno.

abstract={Robustness of the controller is vital in many process industries. The robust controller will not only compensate for disturbance but also for the parametric variation in the process itself. This paper proposes the design of such a robust propositional-integral (PI) controller for a non-linear level control process, like hemi-spherical tank system, using volumetric observer. In a level control system, the volume has a linear relation to the differences in inflow and outflow, whereas the rate change in height is non-linearly related to the flow difference. The robustness of the proposed controller was enhanced by using volume error instead of level error. The volume error is derived by using a volumetric observer, which observes the tank volume and a volume estimator, which estimate the desired tank volume. This enables a linear controller like PI controller to be more robust over the entire span of tank height. The robustness of the proposed controller was compared with the conventional controller and its performance is validated by using the averaged performance indices like averaged-ISE, ITAE and IAE. Simulation results illustrates that the proposed controller has faster response and lesser oscillations. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Over 80% of the world’s people with visual impairment are living in countries which are financially dire. And over 50% of them are above the age of 50 years. The need for a system or of technology that would enable this sector of people to perceive the world in much the same way as the rest of us is imminent. The article presents a novel way to eliminate the use of data acquisition system (DAQ) systems/micro-controllers by incorporating a headphone jack. With the aid of a headphone jack, a cost-effective wearable ultrasonic module that would enable people with visual impairment to virtually see is implemented. Unlike conventional walking canes or its derivatives that do not offer effective feedback, the ingenuity in the proposed module is that it offers audible feedback to the user. The ultrasonic sensor is coupled with the headphone jack and the output of the sensor is relayed to the earphones with the help of a free mobile app (Mic To Speaker). This substantially reduces the cost of the module (since no DAQs/micro-controllers are used) and the processing needed as well. © The Author(s) 2017.},

abstract={In this paper, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with Set Partitioning in Hierarchical Trees (SPIHT) propounds to accomplish an image compression. A lossy technique is introduced through the PCA which is followed by SPIHT to enhance the compression performance. The Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) value of the reconstructed image acquired from the PCA methods is not found to be sufficient which can be further improved by another method called SPIHT. In this paper, a hybrid compression model is constructed to accomplish the benefits of both PCA and SPIHT. In the bio-medical research, compression becomes necessary due to transfer of patients images from one group of experts to other experts group. So that, the proposed image compression technique is useful for conserving the storage space needed for healthcare systems. Finally, it is concluded that the proposed PCA-SPIHT performs better than other recent state-of-the-art techniques with acceptable loss of image quality. © 2017, Scientific Publishers of India.

DPABM-2 did not show significant fluorescence changes to external stimuli, however, DPABM-3 and DPABM-4 exhibited off-on fluorescence switching. DPABM-3 also showed tunable fluorescence via polymorphism. Interestingly, DPABM-5-7 showed alkyl chain orientation dependent self-reversible thermochromism. DPABM-5 and DPABM-7 exhibited decrease of fluorescence intensity with temperature whereas DPABM-6 showed increase of fluorescence intensity. Solid state structural analysis revealed the influence of alkyl chain length on the molecular conformations and packing. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) studies indicate that phase change of materials from crystalline to amorphous and vice-versa was responsible for fluorescence switching with external stimuli. Further, AEE of DPABM derivatives and the reactive ethylene-malononitrile has also been exploited for fabricating hydrazine sensing polymer composite film. Thus simple change of alkyl chain lengths lead to the generation of polymorphism, mechanochromism and temperature dependent self-reversible fluorescence switching materials. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

abstract={The bubble detector is used to detect the amount of neutron and hence used to measure the neutron dose under intense gamma field. Usually, this device is used in the field of atomic energy to manipulate the neutron dosage. The radioactive premises bubbles will be formed based on the radioactive. It can be used to monitor radioactive exposure. The number of nucleated bubbles yields the neutron dose. Hence the accuracy of the measurement depends on the counting of bubbles. This work proposes an image processing based different edge detection technique to find the edges of the bubbles and analyses the edge detection operator. Whereas several algorithms are projected for the aim of image edge detection technique, the matter of finding the image edge detection remains an open challenge in the image processing field, particularly in things wherever the image quality is poor condition. In this paper we deal with the finding and extraction of bubble edge of a Dosimeter bubble detector image using different digital image processing edge detection techniques. This technique is used for finding discontinuities in intensity values. Thereby it is used for finding the boundaries of bubble objects within the image. Here in this study, we can come to know the boundaries of bubbles which can be found in different edge detection technique to get better results for counting bubbles and various advantages and disadvantages of edge detection techniques. © 2017, Scientific Publishers of India, All rights reserved.},

abstract={This study examines the low-energy impact response of Fibre Reinforced Concrete (FRC) made of binary and quaternary cementitious blends, comprising of Lime Sludge (LS), Fly Ash (FA) and Metakaolin (MT). Hooked end steel fibres of aspect ratio 50 were used at different volume fractions of 0.5%, 1.0%, and 1.5%. Altogether 34 concrete mixes were designed using binary and quaternary cementitious systems with water-to-cementitious ratios (w/c) of 0.32 and 0.4. The binary systems were designed with various LS proportions ranging from 5% to 15%, although the quaternary system consisted of various proportions of LS (5%, 10% and 15%), 15% of FA and 5% of MT as a partial substitute of cement. Impact test was conducted on FRC specimens using drop weight facility, recommended by American Concrete Institute (ACI) Committee 544. Based on the obtained experimental results, an analytical multiple linear regression analysis was executed to evaluate the impact energy at first crack and failure of FRC made with binary and quaternary cementitious blends. These result reveals that replacing cement by optimized proportions of 10% LS, 15% FA and 5% MT as a pozzolanic material along with steelfibres has significantly enhanced the impact energy absorption capacity of concrete. © 2017, Fundatia Serban Solacolu.

abstract={Fluorescent carbon quantum dots (CQDs) synthesized using an amino acid-based phenolic chelating ligand, 2-(2-hydroxybenzylamino)propanoic acid, via a hydrothermal method showed selective turn-on fluorescence for Zn2+ and turn-off for Pb2+ in aqueous medium. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed uniformly dispersed spherical CQDs (3-5 nm). Fourier transform infrared and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies confirmed carboxyl, hydroxy and amine-based surface functional groups. The CQDs exhibited good fluorescence intensity at 488 nm as well as excitation wavelength-dependent fluorescence. Interestingly, Zn2+ addition selectively blue shifted the fluorescence from 488 to 460 nm with a broad fluorescence, which led to white emission in the solution. In contrast, Pb2+ addition substantially quenched the fluorescence with a red shift in λmax. Thus, the CQDs showed selective sensing of Zn2+ and Pb2+ ions in aqueous media with completely distinguishable response. Concentration-dependent studies suggested that the CQDs can detect down to μM concentrations of Zn2+ and Pb2+ ions. Interference studies revealed good selectivity for Zn2+ and Pb2+ ions in the presence of other metal cations. Importantly, the fluorescence sensing of both Zn2+ and Pb2+ ions was performed in zebrafish eggs to demonstrate the biological application of the synthesized CQDs. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.},

abstract={Entrepreneurs attempt to change the factor combinations and thus increase productivity and profits.They are exceptionally versatile with only a meager amount of resources at their disposal. Their potential is such that they will build a machine by themselves if they are not able to buy and they can improvise a technique on their own if they cannot reproduce. They respond to changes in market conditions and new demands to the extent of information and circumstances available. The spirit of enterprise is inbuilt in them. This spirit is an outcome of the traits they possess. Today, women entrepreneurship is a global phenomenon. India as a developing economy is not lagging behind in promoting women entrepreneurship. Women have emerged as entrepreneurs, emancipated, educated and empowered by the massive development programmes of the government and women liberation movements. Women have progressed into a new era and aim to be active in 4E's namely Electricity, Electronics, Energy and Engineering (Massod Rana Zehra, 2011). Women are encouraged by reservations, incentives and subsidies to operate in different fields especially in the SSI sector. Thus, this study attempts to assess the oddity possessed by women entrepreneurs and the supporting role played by Government agencies in the development of women entrepreneurship in Thanjavur district.},

abstract={A drop-weight impact test was conducted to evaluate the impact resistance of Green High Performance Plain Concrete (GHPPC) and Green High Performance Fibre Reinforced Concrete (GHPFRC) subjected to freeze-thaw cycles in water containing 3.0 % NaCl solution. The green high performance concrete mixtures were prepared using 10 % of micro silica as cement replacement, 30 % of copper slag as fine aggregate replacement and hooked end steel fibres were incorporated at 1.0 % volume fraction. All the specimens were frozen and thawed for 25 cycles, following which the impact strength of the frozen and thawed specimens was determined. Due to the variations in impact test results, a reliability analysis was carried out using two parameter Weibull distribution and its Weibull parameters were determined using two methods viz., Energy pattern factor method (EFM) and Method of Moments (MOM). Furthermore, impact strength in terms of reliability was reported using the average value of Weibull parameters obtained from these two methods. The results revealed that impact resistance of GHPPC and GHPFRC specimens subjected to 25 cycles of freeze and thaw in water containing 3% NaCl solution was significantly reduced. © 2017, Kauno Technologijos Universitetas.

abstract={One of the most recent organizational issues that have yet to receive much attention is incivility in the workplace. Civility in the workplace has received even less attention. And incivility has more impact of such behaviors on the organization. There is a cause significant unenthusiastic impact on employee morale, effectiveness, lost time, and reduced productivity in spite of increased level of incivility is a problem in organizations to date there has been little research done to investigate how organizations can be more civil. Various researches has identified the workplace incivility is related with affecting individual relationship and behaviour which results in job dissatisfaction and turnover. but most of the studies provided the focus of individual behaviour at workplace. Most of the organisations are fail to aware of the consequences of uncivil behaviour which could affect organisation values, and employees interest on the job, time, productivity and performance. To identify the same, the present study focuses on the various factors involved in workforce civility towards their effective work etiquette practices, communication patterns, cost and reward based procedures and practices, conflict resolution and negotiation practices. The research was conducted in one of the leading multinational company dealing with printing of currency notes for Reserve Bank of India. Sample size of 200 employees working in Chennai division is considered for the study. The research has pointed out that out of five components of work force civility, the factor cost & reward alone has significant impact over work force civility among employees. The other components of work force civility such as effective work etiquette, communication, conflict resolution and negotiation has no significant impact on work force civility among employees. The study concluded that Civility & Incivility are specific to today's organisation policy and practising culture in the work place. © Serials Publications Pvt. Ltd.},

The paper also attempted to find out the willingness of the respondents to contribute ideas to "India Innovation Lab for Green Finance". Methods/Analysis: The study is a descriptive study with survey method. The sample constituted 820 respondents from four major cities in Tamilnadu (Chennai, Madurai, Coimbatore and Trichy). Convenience sampling method was adopted for collecting primary data through interview schedule. The secondary data were collected from books, journals and websites. The data were analyzed using appropriate statistical tools such as Percentage analysis, weighted average with ranking, Chi-square and One-way ANOVA. Findings: Compared to the other awareness factors, green growth was ranked high and idea generation and submission was ranked last with respect to awareness level of respondents. Based on ANOVA, qualification and research experience of the respondents have influence on their awareness towards green growth and idea generation & submission. Recommendations: This paper unwrap the very low awareness among the respondents towards the innovative initiative of the Government to fund green infrastructure projects. The paper suggests the Government to conduct free seminars in universities/colleges, include green infrastructure and green finance in the school/college curriculum, attempt collaborative campaigns with local Governments, and to form special committees with varied experts and promote campaigns through social media networks. © Serials Publications Pvt.

abstract={India is in a threshold of a unique era. For the first time from time immemorial, India is in a situation of having a huge demographic dividend over all countries of the world. India has the advantage of demographic dividend and a pool of young English-speaking people, all demographic studies agree that by 2022 India would be one of the higher volume young workforce in the world with average Indian's age being 29, compared to 37 for China and the US, and 45 for Western Europe. In addition, at 7.1 % GDP growth rate projected for Quarter ending March 2017, India is still the fastest growing economy in the world and this is going to need millions of skilled manpower to power this economy. Though the productive group has demographic dividend benefit but still India is not leveraging it as most of the population in working age not employable fully. At the other side, industries are running with scarcity of workforce. The study has been focused on the employability skills of software professionals working in software industry in Bengaluru. NASCOM registered five companies were selected randomly and two hundred IT professionals comprising forty respondents approximately belonging to various departments were randomly selected for the collection of primary data. The six employability factors such as Numerical ability, Logical ability, Domain Knowledge, Communication Skills, Learning Agility & adaptability and Interpersonal skills were considered. The findings have given a significant approach in employability skill of IT professionals. The first three skills which have significant impact over the overall employability skills are termed as Hard core skills and the remaining three as communication skills, learning agility and interpersonal skills are termed as soft core skills. According to the HRD ministry, engineering institutions in India (6,214) registered nearly 2.9 million students out of which 1.5 million engineers are graduated every year. It is only a quantitative numbers which do not ensure any employability skills. The number of higher education institutions, profit ploughing education leaders, schooling system and quality of faculty members and learning methods is some of the issues to be highlighted for the progress of education system in India. © Serials Publications Pvt.

abstract={Both agricultural input subsidies and output price support are complementary to each other for achieving higher level of agricultural productivity, profitability and growth. The 400 respondent farmers are chosen from the states of Andhra Pradesh, Telengana, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu for the present study by using multi stage random sampling method. To accomplish the objectives and test the hypotheses, the percentage analysis, Analysis of Variance [ANOVA] test and t-Test are carried out. The results reveal that 71.25 per cent of respondent farmers are of the view that the level of awareness towards agricultural input subsidies at moderate level. Further there is significant difference between size of holdings and awareness of respondent farmers towards agricultural input subsidies. The results imply that 71.50 per cent of respondent farmers view that the level of awareness towards minimum support prices at moderate level and there is significant difference between size of holdings and awareness of respondent farmers towards minimum support prices. Besides, there is no significant difference between awareness of respondent farmers towards agricultural input subsidies and minimum support prices. By and large, agriculture is dominated by small and marginal farmers in Southern states of India, who are resource poor and low capacity to buy agricultural inputs, therefore, the Government should put more efforts to increase the awareness of marginal and small farmers towards agricultural input subsidies through effective awareness campaigns. The Government should distribute more agricultural input subsidies to targeted marginal and small farmers as compared to medium and large farmers. In addition, the Government should fix minimum support prices in such a way it covers cost of production and procure crops timely from targeted medium and large farmers. © Serials Publications Pvt.

abstract={Mobile telephones are playing a predominant role in today modern world. It becomes an massive integral part of progress, growth, success and efficiency of the business and world economy. Consumers are considered as a backbone of all business avenues and it associated with all the business activities concern with consumer and consumer satisfaction. The brand acts as via media to consumer to finalize and quickly recognized a product as they are familiar with or other they like very much. The power of a brand facilitates the consumer to buy the product and facilitate them to quick finalization of purchase. A wise attempt has been made in this paper to know the buying thoughts and behavior of rural and urban consumer and find out the feasible priorities while make a purchase decision regarding the process of purchasing the mobiles phones. This study has been conducted through literature study as well as questionnaire used among the 120 respondents of different gender, age, income and their occupation and has been analyzed with statistical tools for getting better results. The study attempts to reveal the urban consumer is more brand style conscious compared to its rural counterpart who prioritizes the utility and price and other factors. It also shows that urban population relies majorly on websites as sources of information where as rural population more lies on T V advertisements and information from mobile phone retailers. This paper paves a suggestive guideline for management to review their advertising modality and modify their mobile functional according to te need of the customer. © 2017 Serials Publications Pvt.

abstract={The term drones covers a very broad category of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVS) that can be used for anything from military or commercial purposes, to personal entertainment. The term drones covers a very broad category of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVS) that can be used for anything from military or commercial purposes, to personal entertainment. The government has granted permission to the Gas Authority of India Limited (GAIL) to use drones for aerial surveillance of its pipelines. This follows the use of drones for similar purposes by the Indian Railways and the National Highways Authority of India. as line patrolling is extremely difficult for pipeline sections passing through forests, rivers, environmentally sensitive areas and other inaccessible areas, GAIL (India) Limited has awarded an order for aerial surveillance of 200 kilometres for the Hazira Vijaipur Jagdishpur/Dahej Vijaipur pipelines with drones as a pilot project by Minister of State (independent charge) of Petroleum and Natural Gas Dharmendra Pradhan. Currently, it is being achieved through regular, periodic, foot-patrolling and air surveillance by hiring helicopter services on a monthly basis. With limited transport infrastructure Indian logistics must look in to use of drones Safely. Before any such change can happen in logistics industry it is high time to measure and monitor the awareness towards drone logistics among Indians. This forms the need for the present study. The study objective covers the overall awareness towards drone logistics among public. Specifically, it focuses on the awareness on benefits and cost aspects of the service in India. The study was conducted among the online customers of Snapdeal and Amazon for a specific period of two months. The customers are chosen from a reputed educational institution randomly selected using simple random sampling. The results of the study showed that 'Awareness that drone was trialed by Amazon.inc' and 'not used by Snap deal/Flipkart/Amazon.in', 'awareness of non-availability of drone delivery in India, drones are impersonal way of delivering goods' and 'awareness that drones are comparatively costlier'are significant while estimating overall awareness towards drone delivery, as the significance of 't' is less than 0.05. To conclude, the public awareness towards the usage of drone services was good and identifies it as one of the costlier services in India. © Serials Publications Pvt. Ltd.},

abstract={Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to develop a mathematical model for delamination during drilling by using a response surface methodology (RSM) and also to determine how the input parameters (tool diameter, spindle speed and feed rate) influence the output response (delamination) in machining of fiber metal laminates. Design/methodology/approach – Three factors and a three-level central composite design in RSM are used to carry out the experimental investigation. A video measuring system is used to measure the width of maximum damage of the machined FML composite. The “Design Expert 7.0” is used to analyze the data collected graphically. Analysis of variance is carried out to validate the model and for determining the most significant parameter. Findings – The response surface model is used to predict the input factors influencing the delamination on the machined surfaces of the ARALL composite at different cutting conditions with the chosen range of 95 percent confidence intervals. Analysis of the influences of entire individual input machining parameters on the delamination has been carried out using RSM. Originality/value – The effect of delamination on drilling of ARALL composites with solid carbide tools of various diameters has not been analyzed yet using RSM. © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Highly stable supercooled fluorescent liquids and crystallization-induced reversible fluorescence switching have been achieved via varying the alkyl chain length of the alkoxy group in the triphenylamine aldehyde, 4-(diphenylamino)-2-methoxybenzaldehyde (DPAMB). DPAMB and different alkyl chain substituted compounds, namely, ethyl (DPAEB), propyl (DPAPrB), butyl (DPABB), pentyl (DPAPeB), hexyl (DPAHB) and cyanohexyl (DPAH-CNB), exhibited weak fluorescence (λmax between 429 and 490 nm) in the solid state except DPAEB which did not show any measurable fluorescence. Structural analysis was performed to obtain an insight into the alkyl chain length effect on molecular packing in the solid state. Hard crushing of all the solids led to a drastic enhancement of the fluorescence intensity without altering λmax. Interestingly, the melts of all the compounds showed strong fluorescence with a red shift of the fluorescence λmax (460-489 nm). Slight rubbing of the melts produced reversible fluorescence switching. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) studies suggested that the conversion from crystalline into amorphous and vice versa while melting the solids and rubbing the melts was responsible for the fluorescence switching. Importantly, the melt showed an alkyl chain length dependent stable supercooled fluorescent liquid at room temperature. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) indicated crystallization of the melts while heating/cooling the DPAMB and DPAEB melts, whereas DPAPrB, DPABB, DPAPeB, DPAHB and DPAH-CNB did not show any crystallization in the subsequent cooling/heating cycles. Thus, the alkyl chain length and propeller molecular shape of triphenylamine have been utilized for developing strongly fluorescent supercooled fluorescent liquids at room temperature. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={Nitrogen oxides (NOx) and Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) result in the formation of ozone in the troposphere as an outcome of a chain of intricate reactions between them and are thus the precursors of ozone. Thermal power plants are one of the major sources of these precursors. The present investigation deals with identification of an important model, specifically with the function of an Artificial neural network (ANN) to simulate the forecasting of surface ozone in the vicinity of a Thermal Power Plant. The ANN model was developed with neural applet version 4.3.8 to forecast diurnal ground level concentrations of ozone. Further ambient ozone concentrations were predicted using surface meteorological variables such as Temperature (Temp), cloud cover, rainfall, relative humidity (RH) along with the precursor NOx pollutant variable. Predicted and measured NOx values were used as predictors. Predicted NOx values were obtained from Industrial source complex short term version 3 (ISCST3) model. The results indicated that among all the meteorological inputs, temperature plays a significant role in the production of ozone and nitrogen oxide concentrations are directly related to the forecasted surface ozone concentrations. The predicted values of ozone from ANN model were found to be in good agreement with measured concentrations and thus validating the developed model. It was established that the measured concentrations and predicted concentrations by the model are reliable.},

abstract={We investigate the dynamics of thermoacoustic interactions associated during vortex acoustic lock-on in the phase space. Experiments are performed in a premixed, gas fueled bluff body stabilized combustor. The geometry of the burner is designed such that vortex shedding from the bluff body is strong. Air flow rate is varied in a quasi-steady manner, for a given fuel flow rate. It is observed that at low air flow rates, the dominant frequency increases linearly with the air flow rate. The obtained Strouhal number matches with the mode associated with vortex shedding from the bluff body. On the other hand, for higher flow rates the dominant frequency remains almost constant with the air flow rate, indicating the acoustic mode of the combustor. It is also found that at these flow rates, vortex shedding process locks on to the frequency of the acoustic mode. Tools from nonlinear time series analysis are applied to study this transition. The attractor is reconstructed in the phase space and its properties are monitored.},

abstract={The intriguing structural properties of coordination polymers (COPs), together with the huge variety of metal ions and organic linkers to choose from, make COPs potential precursors for fabricating carbon-encapsulated metal and metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs). Herein, we have studied the role of the COP structural assembly, prepared through making subtle changes to the ligand structure, on the formation of NPs in a carbon matrix. Cu-COPs (Cu-COP-1-Cu-COP-7), generated using different amino acid-based reduced Schiff base phenolic chelating ligands, exhibited crystalline structures with differing structural organization in the solid state. Interestingly, the calcination of Cu-COP-1 and Cu-COP-5 at 330 °C produced pure CuNPs, whereas Cu-COP-2, Cu-COP-3, Cu-COP-4 and Cu-COP-7 gave CuONPs encapsulated by carbon matrix. The calcination of Cu-COP-6 produced both CuNPs and CuONPs together in the carbon matrix. The formation of CuNPs and CuONPs in the carbon matrices was unambiguously confirmed by PXRD and XPS studies. The sizes and morphologies of the Cu/CuONPs were analyzed using HR-TEM and FE-SEM. BET studies revealed higher surface areas with small pores for the CuNPs encapsulated by carbon and lower surface areas with higher porosity for the CuONP-carbon matrix. Raman spectra revealed the formation of a nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO) carbon matrix in CuNPs-1. The N-rGO coverage and high surface area with small pores provided CuNPs-1 with good stability in strong acid (10 M H2SO4). Importantly, the fabricated N-rGO-encapsulated CuNPs-1 and carbon-covered CuONPs-4 nanocomposites were used as green catalysts in solvent-free neat A3-coupling and nitroarene-reduction reactions, respectively. The products were confirmed using 1H-NMR spectra. The recovered CuNPs-1 and CuONPs-4 catalysts, after the completion of the reactions, also showed similar catalytic activity at up to five cycles, without significant loss of catalytic activity. Thus, the present studies demonstrate the influence of Cu-COP structural assembly on the formation of Cu/CuONPs as well as the carbon matrix, and open the possibility of fabricating functional nanomaterials from the vast number of available COPs with intriguing structural motifs. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={Pollution is the major problem near Thermal power plants which is to be addressed. This can be done by studying the behavior of the pollutants, their evolution and the reasons for their propagation. One such pollutant is sulfurdioxide (SO 2 ). The present study is about the prediction of the concentration of SO 2 in and around the areas of the Rayalseema Thermal Power Project which is a coal fired thermalpower project located in Andhra Pradesh, India. A dispersion modelling technique ISCST3 (Industrial Source Complex Short-Term version-3) is used for this prediction. The land area in the vicinity of the RTPP with a radius of approximately 10,000 meters is considered as the study area for the duration of one year. 3-dimensional view and Isopleths of the concentration of SO 2 are modeled using Golden software surfer version 8 and ISCST3. A comparative study is done using the measurements from Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Stations (AAQMS).The coefficients of determination (R2) range between 0.98 and 0.99 in the course of the study.},

SIMO converters fulfill to offer a power supply with different voltage and current levels suitable for use in portable electronics. The theory allows the advantages of reduction in cost and size due to the presence of single inductor associated with the systems but experiences a disadvantage in terms of cross regulation between the different outputs when the load conditions change. The formulation evolves the philosophy of using the principles of Error Compensator, PID controller, Fuzzy tuned PID controller and Sliding Mode Controller (SMC) individually through a multi loop schematic to improve the time response specifications of the system and provide a regulated output over a wide range of operating loads. The test results obtained using DT9834 Data Acquisition Module (DAQ) based hardware validates the simulated response and reveals that the SMC outperforms the others controllers. The performance of the converter opens up a new dimension to the use of the utilities in the domestic world and corner greater milestones for the electronic industry. © 2017 SERSC Australia.},

abstract={Rapid growth of recommender systems (RSs) had proved its potential in the generation of personalized recommendations in various application domains. Generally, RSs learn the user’s preferences and interests to suggest relevant items to the users. RSs are widely employed in various domains such as movies, e-commerce, travel, etc. Due to rapid growth in travel applications, Travel Recommender Systems (TRSs) had received a significant attention from researchers. Though existing TRS help users as digital support assistants in the travel, still the TRSs faces huge barriers in understanding user interests based on user's current emotional context. In this paper, to generate effective personalized Point of Interest (POI) recommendations, we present a Dynamic Particle Swarm Optimization and Hierarchy Induced K-Means (DPSOHiK) approach for the better POI clustering through utilizing electroencephalography (EEG) feedback. The DPSOHiK approach, with its capabilities to adapt the changing attributes helps in the POI clustering process. The clustered POIs are utilized in the recommendation process and based on the user's personal preferences the POIs are ranked to meet the requirements of the user. We have experimentally evaluated our proposed recommendation approach to demonstrate the recommendation potential and compared the obtained results with the baseline approaches. The experimental results depict the importance of EEG feedback in the enhancement of recommendation accuracy and provide helpful insights to the researchers to utilize EEG in the RSs research and development. © 2017, Scientific Publishers of India.

abstract={With the widespread adoption of e-Healthcare and telemedicine applications, accurate, intelligent disease diagnosis systems have been profoundly coveted. In recent years, numerous individual machine learning-based classifiers have been proposed and tested, and the fact that a single classifier cannot effectively classify and diagnose all diseases has been almost accorded with. This has seen a number of recent research attempts to arrive at a consensus using ensemble classification techniques. In this paper, a hybrid system is proposed to diagnose ailments using optimizing individual classifier parameters for two classifier techniques, namely, support vector machine (SVM) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) technique. We employ three recent evolutionary algorithms to optimize the parameters of the classifiers above, leading to six alternative hybrid disease diagnosis systems, also referred to as hybrid intelligent systems (HISs). Multiple objectives, namely, prediction accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, have been considered to assess the efficacy of the proposed hybrid systems with existing ones. The proposed model is evaluated on 11 benchmark datasets, and the obtained results demonstrate that our proposed hybrid diagnosis systems perform better in terms of disease prediction accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Pertinent statistical tests were carried out to substantiate the efficacy of the obtained results. © 2017 MadhuSudana Rao Nalluri et al.},

abstract={Epilepsy is generally considered as a collection of neurological disorders manifested by epileptic seizures. It is often confirmed with an electroencephalogram (EEG). EEG signals are non stationary, nonlinear and non Gaussian. In this paper, in order to tackle this problem, we have used three different methods for feature extraction namely wavelet based entropy (approximation entropy, sample entropy, permutation entropy), nonlinear features (Hurst exponent, Higuchi Fractal Dimension) and higher order spectra (mean, normalized entropy-1 and normalized entropy-2). Further multiclass classification using indirect approach with One vs One method is employed using heterogenous ensemble learning approach. Entropy features are used for classifying normal and interictal class using k-Nearest Neighbor. Higher Order Spectra features are used for classifying normal and ictal class using Support Vector Machine with Radial basis function as kernel and non linear features are used for classifying interictal and ictal class using Naive Bayes. Final verdict is taken by meta classifier with meta learning algorithm Stacking Correspondence Analysis and Nearest Neighbor (SCANN). The proposed method surpasses the existing methods in literature in terms of sensitivity and specificity. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Lean construction is an applied form of a concept practiced in production and operations management in the manufacturing sector. It mainly focuses on continuous improvements in the production processes be eliminating redundancies from the value chain, resulting in improved delivery of the finished goods offering more value to the end customer. Value Stream Mapping (VSM) is a lean tool which enables the user to map a process with respect to the value addition activities for the customer. It gives a visual representation of the flow of information, processes and their durations involved in the production process. A non-value added activity is identified as waste on a value stream map. Using VSM, a current state map of the production process is prepared and analyzed. On identification of the potential wastes, an improved process map called 'Future State Map' is prepared. In this research work, the authors have focused on the construction process of a residential construction project and attempted to implement VSM to gain an enhanced lean construction system. The authors have planned to prepare the current state for the floor-floor production process of a residential project. After performing a systematic analysis, a future state map shall be prepared to state the benefits of minimizing the waste activities in the process.

abstract={The use of bimetallic nanoparticles (BNPs) for contaminant reduction has gained prominence in recent years. In this work, the effect of initial selenium concentration, BNP loading, dissolved oxygen and pH on selenium reduction using Ni-Fe BNPs was investigated in batch kinetic and equilibrium studies. Equilibrium studies revealed that maximum selenium uptake was obtained at near neutral pH. Reaction kinetics of Se(VI) and Se(IV) reduction on Ni-Fe BNPs was best described Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics, with first order at low Se concentrations and zero order at high Se concentrations. For both selenium species, complete removal was obtained within 1 h of contact time. Reaction rates for Se(VI) were higher than that of Se(IV), indicating a two-step reduction process. With increase in Ni-Fe loading (i.e., increase in number of active surface sites), reaction rates also increased linearly, suggestive of an adsorption-controlled rate-limiting step. Deviation from linearity was observed due to the deactivation of the Ni-Fe catalysts. The presence of dissolved oxygen did not significantly affect Se reduction rates. Reduction of selenate, Se(VI), and selenite, Se(IV), on Ni-Fe BNPs occurred primarily due to: (1) adsorption of Se species on the active surface sites; (2) chemical reduction reactions on the surface and (3) sorption of the reduced Se species. © 2017 Desalination Publications.},

abstract={In agriculture (in the context of this paper, the terms “agriculture” and “farming” refer to only the farming of crops and exclude the farming of animals), smart farming and automated agricultural technology have emerged as promising methodologies for increasing the crop productivity without sacrificing produce quality. The emergence of various robotics technologies has facilitated the application of these techniques in agricultural processes. However, incorporating this technology in farms has proven to be challenging because of the large variations in shape, size, rate and type of growth, type of produce, and environmental requirements for different types of crops. Agricultural processes are chains of systematic, repetitive, and time-dependent tasks. However, some agricultural processes differ based on the type of farming, namely permanent crop farming and arable farming. Permanent crop farming includes permanent crops or woody plants such as orchards and vineyards whereas arable farming includes temporary crops such as wheat and rice. Major operations in open arable farming include tilling, soil analysis, seeding, transplanting, crop scouting, pest control, weed removal and harvesting where robots can assist in performing all of these tasks. Each specific operation requires axillary devices and sensors with specific functions. This article reviews the latest advances in the application of mobile robots in these agricultural operations for open arable farming and provide an overview of the systems and techniques that are used. This article also discusses various challenges for future improvements in using reliable mobile robots for arable farming. © 2017 INIA.},

Banking sectors in their part involved in developing apps to reduce the load of their consumers. But the problem is, each banking sector either private or public, develops and implements applications exclusively to operate its bank accounts alone. People having multiple bank accounts for various reasons have to make use of all these individual apps. Henceforth, they are forced to remember their confidential details for individual applications. Some researchers have come out with a diversified solution to bring down all the bank accounts to be accessed via a common layer. The major problem is, when a vast amount of data is being integrated, the volume, variety and veracity of data becomes huge which a conventional computing cannot withhold. Such a Big Data can be handled in an efficient manner in the proposed system. The system integrates the customer’s multiple accounts in a common layer that satisfies all of his transaction needs. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={In the present world of large distributed systems and energy shortages, energy efficiency has become mandatory. One way to achieve this is by proper scheduling of tasks in a system of connected and dissimilar machines to minimize the energy consumption. Also, Jobs have to be scheduled properly to different systems in order to achieve maximum utilization of machines. “Makespan” has been the standard optimization criteria used in scheduling algorithms. Makespan is the time elapsed until all jobs scheduled are completely processed. A scheduling algorithm must look to minimize the makespan while satisfying the precedence constraints between the tasks. Though the problem is NP-hard, many algorithms have been proposed. There are algorithms proposed to reduce the energy consumption for uni-machine systems and sequential tasks. Our algorithm tries to reduce the overall energy consumption of a schedule in parallel and distributed systems by minimizing the idle state times of machines and thereby, keeping the makespan as low as possible. Our algorithm is more practical and executes much faster compared to the previous works on energy-aware scheduling. © 2017, Scientific Publishers of India. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Over the last decade, there has been a burgeoning of data due to social media, e-commerce and overall digitisation of enterprises. The data is exploited to make informed choices, predict marketplace trends and patterns in consumer preferences. Recommendation systems have become ubiquitous after the penetration of internet services among the masses. The idea is to make use of filtering and clustering techniques to suggest items of interest to users. For a media commodity like movies, suggestions are made to users by finding user profiles of individuals with similar tastes. Initially, user preference is obtained by letting them rate movies of their choice. Upon usage, the recommender system will be able to understand the user better and suggest movies that are more likely to be rated higher. The experiment results on the MovieLens dataset provides a reliable model which is precise and generates more personalised movie recommendations compared to other models.

abstract={Background: Cognitive Radio (CR) is an intelligent Software Defined Radio (SDR). The CR technology facilitates spectrum reuse and assuages spectrum chomp. Effective spectrum sensing confirms cognitive radio users resourcefully using the under-utilized frequency band without triggering destructive interference to primary users. Recently CR plays a vital role in the development of unguided communications system. Materials and Methods: This study examines the use of adaptive batch testing to find the spectrum holes of a specified bandwidth in a given Wide Band (WB) of interest and also designed a crisis based adaptive batch and Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) management in CR. Results: In place of testing and allocating a single slot for a user, this method can accommodate N number of users in a set of band during emergency conditions. The FIS is used to estimate the channel condition by analyzing the four parameters like signal power, speed, remoteness and effectiveness. Conclusion:The proposed system reduces theaverage sensing time, management time as a function of SNR. Number of users and the efficiency is also high when more number of users was managed at same time. © 2017 Qomarlyatus Sholihah etal. All right reserved.},

abstract={High speed communication networks facilitate the simple and rapid mode of online information sharing with high data rates. But the channels which are used for data sharing are not secure. The subject of data security emerges in such scenarios. To achieve this, different security methods are being used in digital communication. Cryptography is one of the popular techniques, but the scrambled appearance of encrypted information can lead to high probability of attacks. Hiding information in a cover is one of the alternatives to cryptography. The main objective of this study is to provide an overall idea about the popular as well as emerging data hiding techniques in spatial and transform domains. This study deals with both reversible and non-reversible data hiding methods. Also, this study briefly discusses some common steganalytic techniques and concludes with an idea of the future scope of Reversible Data Hiding (RDH). The wide range of these techniques will provide a good overview about current trends in transform domain steganography to the researchers who are interested in steganography. © 2017 Ahmad Shaik et al.},

The use of a shunt hybrid configuration retains the advantages of lower cost and simplicity of the passive filter along with reduced rating of the active filter. The suggested control strategy is based on the extraction of reference current from source voltage of one phase and source currents that minimize the number of sensors and complexity of control scheme. By focusing on the deviations of dc link voltage across the capacitor which is caused by harmonic components in the load currents the correction mechanism straight away utilizes the deviations by processing via a conventional PI controller generates the reference current. This proposed model has been demonstrated through the simulation using MATLAB Simulink software under various operating conditions.

abstract={Partial Discharges (PD) are recognized as one of the main causes of degradation of internal insulation of power equipment and its subsequent failure in high voltage equipment. In most real-time applications such as extruded cables, Gas Insulated Substations (GIS) etc., polymeric insulation systems which invariably used. It is necessary and demand to detect even very low levels of PD pulse discharge and it becomes imperative that improved PD measurement systems capable of accurately detecting and acquiring pulse are utilized for diagnosis. Hence, from the perspective of practical on-site PD measurement and analysis, several non-conventional PD detection and measurement techniques are increasing being utilized. It necessitates meaningful measures to ensure appropriate noise detection and its removal. Detection and analysis of PD signals are significantly influenced by a variety of sources of noise during on-site measurement. Different types of noise interferences affect the measurement of PD signals which includes discrete spectral interference, repetitive pulses from power electronics components, amplifier noises etc. This research survey presents an overview of the state of the art of various PD detection and de-noising in detailed perspective and insight into the various PD detection and measurement techniques. Also this paper presents the appropriate methods to extract the PD pulses from various types of noises. In addition, a substantially exhaustive compendium of findings reported by several researchers has been carried out and a comprehensive summary of various types of noises and interference signals during measurement of PD including a specific benefits and limitations of various de-noising methods to extract PD pulses from noisy data are discussed in this research survey. © 2006-2017 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).

abstract={Background: The agenda of secret and secured communication is in the lead list of digital communication schemes. Image encryption plays a lead role in both spatial and transforms domains. Materials and Methods: In this study, logistic and standard coupled mapping were employed on a pre and post shuffled image to attain the higher-order cryptic image to convey information between private nodes. The initial conditions to the maps were generated by a trigonometric function, which will provide sternness against hackers. Results: To analyse the rigidness of the implemented algorithm, the standard metrics, that is the Unified Average Changing Intensity (UACI), Number of Pixels Change Rate (NPCR), entropy, correlation values, pixel distribution and histogram tests were estimated. The results were compared with the existing literature and found to be superior or comparable. Conclusion: First, the key space is 2256, which is considerably resistive to brute-force attack. Second, the obtained NPCR, entropy, correlation coefficient and UACI values of 99.6901, 7.99, -0.0015 and 33.44, respectively, prove that the proposed method resists statistical and differential attacks. © 2017 R.

abstract={High efficiency partial rear contact solar cells forms a Metal-Insulator-Semiconductor (MIS) stack in the rear side. Aluminum is used as a local back surface field (localized heavily doped pregion) and a hole contact. The workfunction difference between the aluminum contact and the c-Si(p) causes inversion in the silicon surface of the MIS structure. The surface inversion affects the quality of passivation and hence, the performance of the solar cell which requires further understanding. In this work, we have analysed the influence of aluminum on surface passivation in two passivation stacks namely (i) AlOx/SiNx and (ii) SiOx/SiNx using Sentaurus TCAD simulation. Our simulation result shows that in case of positive dielectric stack (SiOx/SiNx), aluminum workfunction enhances the passivation (effective surface recombination velocity &lt;15 cm/s) for the injection condition of 2×1013cm−3 which is common at the rear side of AlLBSF solar cell. But, in negative dielectric stack (AlOx/SiNx), aluminum workfunction influence is negligible since it is surpassed by high negative fixed charge density. In addition, we have varied the capping layer (SiNx) thickness in the dielectric stack to alter the aluminum influence on the crystalline silicon surface. It shows up to 1.0% absolute improvement in the efficiency for reduced SiNx thickness in the SiOx/SiNx stack for the fixed charge density of 2×1011cm−2, interface trap density of 5×1011cm−2, assumed electron and hole capture cross section of 10−14cm2 and 4×10−16cm2 respectively. This is solely attributed to the aluminum workfunction influence on the rear passivation. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

[Ru(bpy)3]2+-GO nanocomposite on the modified gold (Au) electrode acts as an electrocatalyst and favours the sensitive and selective detection of metal ions. Also, it exhibited an enhanced electron transfer rate with a low solution resistance examined by cyclic voltammetry and impedance analysis. The inherent electrochemical and electrocatalytic behaviours of [Ru(bpy)3]2+-GO on gold electrode were demonstrated for simultaneous detection of heavy metal ions in water matrix. The proposed sensor exhibited a higher sensitivity towards Cd(II), Pb(II), As(III) and Hg(II) metal ions with a lowest detection limit of 2.8, 1.41, 2.3 and 1.6 nM respectively. The observed detection limits were less than the World Health Organization standards and hence the developed sensor can be deployed for detecting heavy metal ions in water bodies.

High content of methyl eugenol (82.5%) in one of the EOs is significant as it could be evaluated for commercial utilization. This is the first report on the chemical compositions of leaf EOs of C. keralaense. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={ZnO and NiO nanopowders are prepared using a simple, cost-effective and eco-friendly green soft chemical method. The XRD studies shows that the prepared powders have high crystallinity with an average crystallite size of 35 and 30 nm, respectively. The EDX study confirms the presence of elements the Zn, Ni and O. Test to find the photocatalytic of ZnO and NiO nanopowders for the degradation of MB dye is performed under visible light. The results reveal that the photocatalytic efficiency of ZnO nanopowders is higher than that of NiO nanopowders. From the antibacterial studies, it is found that the prepared ZnO nanopowder exhibits higher antibacterial efficiency against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus bacteria than NiO nanopowders. The binding affinity of the bacterial strains with the prepared nanoparticles has been calculated by performing a molecular dynamics simulation and the results are found to be matched well with the experimental studies. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Autonomous vehicle navigation in an unfamiliar environment is a challenging task. This investigation presents two algorithms for autonomous vehicle navigation in unknown environments with obstacles. Basic building blocks of the path-planning algorithms are the behaviour-based controller and nonlinear state estimator. Measurements from the sensor mounted on the vehicle are used as the input to the state estimator, whereas the estimated position of the vehicle with respect to the obstacle is the output. The estimate is then used to decide the possible control action from a family of behaviour-based controllers for navigating the vehicle. The first path-planning algorithm uses the extended Kalman filter (EKF) for estimating the vehicle position using measurements of the obstacle position. The second path-planning algorithm uses the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) to estimate thevehicle position. Our results indicate that UKF-based path-planning algorithm performs better than the EKF-based algorithm both in terms of performance and fuel consumption. This is indicated by a 9% reduction of the control effort. Path-planning algorithms presented in this investigation can be used to build reliable autonomous vehicle navigation systems. © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={Triphenylamine (TPA) based donor-acceptor-donor (D-A-D) compounds were synthesized showing aggregation enhanced emission (AEE) and molecular conformation and packing dependent rare self-reversible thermofluorochromism in the solid state. 1, with TPA substituted with phenylenediacetonitrile at both ends, displayed a twisted molecular conformation, whereas OCH3 substitution at the ortho position of TPA (3-MTPA, 2) resulted in a twisted conformation at one end and a coplanar conformation at the other end. The 4-methoxytriphenylamine (4-MTPA) substituted acceptor (3) displayed a coplanar conformation at both ends of the acceptor. The highly twisted conformation of 1 led to strong fluorescence (16.8%) and the coplanar conformation of 3 resulted in weak fluorescence (1.6%) in the solid state. 2 showed moderate fluorescence (8.4%) in the solid state. Importantly, 1 and 2 exhibited self-reversible thermofluorochromism with heating and cooling, whereas 3 did not show any fluorescence switching with temperature change.

abstract={Radiation-induced pneumonitis and fibrosis are major complications following thoracic radiotherapy. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an important role in tissue injury leading to organ fibrosis, including lung. Our previous studies have reported that radiation can induce EMT in the type II alveolar epithelial cells in both in vitro and in vivo. HDAC inhibitors are a new family of anti-cancer agents currently being used in several clinical trials. In addition to their intrinsic anti-tumor properties, HDAC inhibition is also important in other human diseases, including fibrosis and radiation-induced damage. In this study, we evaluated the effect of Trichostatin A (TSA), a HDAC inhibitor, on radiation-induced EMT in type II alveolar epithelial cells (RLE-6TN). Pre-treatment of RLE-6TN cells with TSA inhibited radiation-induced EMTlike morphological alterations including elevated protein level of α-SMA and Snail, reduction of E-cadherin expression, enhanced phosphorylation of GSK3β and ERK1/2, increased generation of ROS. Radiation enhanced the protein level of TGF-β1, which was blocked by N-acetylcysteine, an antioxidant. Treating cells with SB-431542, TGF-β1 type I receptor inhibitor, diminished radiation-induced alterations in the protein levels of p-GSK-3β, Snail-1 and α-SMA, suggesting a regulatory role of TGF-β1 in EMT. Pre-incubation of cells with TSA showed significant decrease in the level of TGF-β1 compared to radiation control. Collectively, these results demonstrate that i] radiation-induced EMT in RLE-6TN cells is mediated by ROS/MEK/ERK and ROS/ TGF-β1 signaling pathways and ii] the inhibitory role of TSA in radiation-induced EMT appears to be due, at least in part, to its action of blocking ROS and TGF-β1 signaling. © Nagarajan et al.},

abstract={MnCO3 is gaining attention of the scientific community as a potential electrode material for supercapacitor applications. It can be easily synthesized by simple, cost effective method using manganese and carbonate precursors. In this article, we report the effect of carbonate precursors on the capacitive storage performance of MnCO3. Carbonate precursors used for the synthesis of MnCO3 were (NH4)HCO3, (NH4)2CO3, K2CO3, Li2CO3, NaHCO3 and Na2CO3. The effect of carbonate precursors on the physico-chemical properties of MnCO3 was studied using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), infra-red spectroscopy (IR), surface area analysis, scanning and transmission electron microscopic techniques. PXRD and IR spectral studies revealed that carbonate precursors do not affect the crystal structure. However, they influence significantly the morphology, surface area and porosity of MnCO3 as revealed by morphological and sorption studies. The capacitance properties of MnCO3 were evaluated in an aqueous 0.1 M Mg(ClO4)2 electrolyte. Specific capacitance value of 103, 116, 120, 121, 123 and 141 F g-1 was obtained for MnCO3 synthesized using (NH4)HCO3, (NH4)2CO3, K2CO3, Li2CO3, NaHCO3 and Na2CO3 as carbonate precursor, respectively. Difference in the specific capacitance is attributed to difference in the morphology and other surface properties. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Bright, sensitive fluorescent probes that respond to changes in the cellular microenvironment are extremely valuable for imaging cellular dynamics. We report a simple, one-step synthesis of a new hemicaynine (HC-1) dye as a sensitive, red-emitting (λmax-610 nm) fluorogenic probe for micro-viscosity and local order in diverse environments, including live cells. HC-1 responds to increasing micro-viscosity through changes in fluorescence intensity and lifetime, and is sensitive enough to report dynamic micellar self-assembly. While HC-1 shows properties of a molecular ‘rotor’, time-dependent density functional theoretical analysis reveals that in HC-1, an inhibition of photo-isomerization in viscous environment is the likely cause of fluorescence enhancement. HC-1 localizes to mitochondria in live cells and responds to mitochondrial ordering through a significant increase in fluorescence. Strikingly, we show that HC-1 is also a sensitive probe for the spatial heterogeneity of mitochondrial organization in embryonic stem cells as well as dynamic remodeling of the mitochondria in early-differentiated cells. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The result reveals that the effect of recent market news on current volatility of exchange rate returns increases and reduces the previous day’s news influencing them during post currency futures. The results from GARCH and GJR GARCH models showed that currency futures trading reduces volatility in spot exchange rate returns of JPY/INR and GBP/INR and increases volatility of exchange rate returns of EURO/ INR during post currency futures period.

abstract={Cloud technology is a great innovation that has brought a big revolution in the information technology industry. Cloud storage facilitates users to access their data anywhere and at any time. The major threat that the cloud is facing now is security. We cannot just rely on one phase authentication process i.e. authenticating the user by using the username and static password. An Unauthorized user can easily enter into the system if he knows the user credentials. In the proposed model a two phase One Time Password (OTP) approach is used to authenticate the user. This method puts a check to unauthorized users from accessing the cloud. Additionally, data Confidentiality and Integrity is ensured by using Secure Socket Layer 128-bit encryption and message authentication code (MAC) respectively. In proposed model the major authentication is preserved with the organization and not with the cloud provider because provider cannot be trusted always. This merger of diverse methods operate as a wall stood together against the security challenges, which have been constantly creating the loop holes in the efficient functioning and growth of the cloud.},

abstract={Circular cylindrical towers which are sporadically seen in engineering structures such as buildings, towers, etc are basically considered as bluff body. The flow around the circular cylindrical structures gained interest among the researchers. Since there has been lot of development in infrastructure, transport, telecommunication in the last two decades. Such cylindrical towers invite more attention, since the failure of circular cylindrical tower/ structures is not only due to the surface pressure distribution but also due to the effect of wake induced by the flow separations. Even though there are engineering challenges in circular cylindrical structures, different designs of structures such as stepped cylinders, rough cylinder and taper cylinder etc. are used in various applications. The flow field downstream is relatively less explored for the tapered circular cylinder than other cylinders. Effects of downstream wake due to such cylindrical structures are not only affecting other structures downstream but also induce vibration on itself. In this paper, circular cylinders of various taper ratios are considered for the study at various sub critical Reynolds number. Extensive wind tunnel studies were performed on various taper ratios ranging from 0.6 to 1 in the increment of 0.1 for various x/D and h/D locations using hot wire anemometer. Various parameters like wake width, dissipation length, wind speed ratios were measured downstream for various taper ratios. The result shows that the magnitude of wake width gradually increases with increase in downstream distance along with increase in taper ratio whereas dissipation length and wind speed ratio increases with decrease in taper ratio.},

abstract={Cement grinding in ball-mill consumes majority of the energy in cement industry. Current models in literature capturing the material flow are not suitable for designing predictive controllers for energy savings. This investigation proposes two data-driven modelling approaches for cement grinding process that relate material flow and energy. Data obtained from a cement grinding circuit in a cement industry located near Chennai, India, is used to build the models. The first modelling approach uses system identification techniques to identify a linear ARX model. A number of candidate models are developed using the collected data and the model that shows reasonable accuracy and less computational intensity is selected to model the cement mill process. The second approach uses the feed-forward neural network (FFNN) to develop a non-parametric model. As the number of neurons in the hidden layer influences the accuracy of the FFNN, different candidate models with various network parameters are tested. The FFNN model that gives better accuracy is selected as the most suitable model. Finally, validation test on the selected parametric and non-parametric models is used to infer the suitability of the models to capture the dynamics of the cement grinding mill process. Our results indicate that the FFNN-based non-parametric model shows better accuracy and computation simplicity than the linear ARX model. Energy saving predictive controllers for cement industries can be designed using the proposed model as it directly maps energy usage with cement production. © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={Triphenylamine (TPA), a propeller-shaped optoelectronic molecule, has been used to generate stimuli-responsive smart fluorescent organic materials and correlate the effect of subtle structural changes on the molecular packing and mechanochromic fluorescence (MCF). The substituent (OCH3) position in the TPA phenyl ring and acceptors (malononitrile, cyanoacetamide, cyanoacetic acid, ethyl cyanoacetate, and diethylmalonate) strongly influenced the solid state and mechanochromic fluorescence as well as the molecular packing. The structure−property studies revealed that (i) TPA derivatives without the OCH3 substituent exhibit strong fluorescence (Φf = 85% (TCAAD-1, 55% (TDEM)), (ii) higher dihedral angle (τ) between donor (aminophenyl) and acceptor lead to weak/non fluorescent material, (iii) substituent at the ortho position to acceptor increased the dihedral angle (τ = 26.49 (TCAAD-2), τ = 27.14 (TDMM)), and (iv) the increase of alkyl groups produced self-reversible high contrast off-on fluorescence switching materials (TDEM). Powder X-ray diffraction studies indicate that stimuli induced reversible phase transformation from crystalline to amorphous and vice versa was responsible for fluorescence switching. The computational studies also supported that OCH3 substitution at ortho to acceptor increased the dihedral angle and optical band gap. Thus, the present studies provide a structural insight for designing TPA based organic molecules for developing new smart organic materials. © 2016 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to optimise the process parameters, namely, point angle, spindle speed and feed rate in the drilling of glass-reinforced stainless steel mesh polymer (GRSSMP) composites using grey relational fuzzy logic. Design/methodology/approach - Based on the full factorial design, the experiments were conducted. The output responses considered are thrust force, torque, delamination and diameter deviation. Based on responses, the optimised process parameter was selected using grey-fuzzy reasoning analysis (GFRA). Findings - The percentage contribution of the drilling parameters is analysed using analysis of variance (ANOVA), and the result shows that feed rate is the most influential factor in the drilling of GRSSMP composites. Research limitations/implications - The optimised drilling parameters have been used for drilling of polymer composites in the production industry. Originality/value - Optimisation of process parameters during the drilling of GRSSMP composites using GFRA has not been performed previously. © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Zinc Oxide (ZnO), ZnO/GO (Graphene Oxide) and ZnO:Ag/GO nanocomposite thin films were deposited on glass substrates using a simple cost-effective automated jet nebulizer spray pyrolysis technique for photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes. The ZnO:Ag/GO film exhibits superior photocatalytic activity when compared with ZnO and ZnO/GO films. The degradation rate constant values of pristine ZnO and ZnO/GO films are found to be 0.0143 and 0.0176 min−1, respectively whereas that of ZnO:Ag/GO is 0.0567 min−1. The possible mechanism involved in the enhanced photocatalytic activity of ZnO:Ag/GO films for the degradation of Methylene Blue dye is proposed with the help of structural, optical and photoluminescence studies. The powder XRD profile confirms the hexagonal wurtzite structure of the synthesized catalysts. The results of Raman, XPS and EDX studies confirm the presence of GO in the ZnO/GO and GO and Ag in the ZnO:Ag/GO films. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.},

abstract={Purpose. To understand the perceptions of adolescents and their parents about spectacle compliance of adolescents in Southern India. Methods. Using a qualitative snapshot design, three focus group discussions were conducted each with parents and adolescents studying in schools located in and around Chennai, Tamil Nadu. Purposive sampling technique was used in the selection of participants. Separate focus group guides were developed for parents and adolescents. All focus group discussions were conducted in the school premises and audio recorded. These audio files were then transcribed verbatim and then translated into English. A framework analytical approach was used for data analysis that involved gaining familiarity with the data to identify a thematic framework. Results. Two major themes that emerged were (1) perceptions on barriers to spectacle compliance that was further subdivided into physical, psychological, and societal barriers; and (2) solutions to improve spectacle use. Barriers identified included scars on the nose, unattractive frames contributing to poor appeal, adolescents feeling discriminated and set apart, fears of injury to eyes, lack of parental involvement, and negative attitudes of society toward those wearing spectacles. Solutions given by the stakeholders included provision of lightweight, well-fitting, trendy frames of adolescents' choice, importance and need for periodical eye examinations, including teachers in encouraging spectacle use and preventing bullying and teasing by other adolescents, provision of free spectacles along with periodic replacement, and inclusion of awareness sessions on spectacle use for both parents and adolescents. Conclusions. The study has identified both barriers and solutions for improving spectacle compliance among school adolescents from the viewpoint of the stakeholders involved. Implementing the solutions suggested by the stakeholders through planned intervention programs could possibly help in ensuring better compliance of spectacle use among school adolescents. © 2017 American Academy of Optometry.},

For this purpose, a former researcher results were statistically investigated using two parameter Weibull distributions and presented the impact strengths in terms of reliability function. Furthermore, the Weibull parameters were determined by two estimation approaches such as least-squares (LS) regression of Y on X and least-squares (LS) regression of X on Y.Analysis suggested that the both the methods are more effective to estimate the Weibull parameters accurately due to that the deviation between the Weibull parameters obtained from the two methods was very less.

abstract={In this study, a singular perturbation based technique is used for synthesis and analysis of a near optimal midcourse guidance law for realistic air-To-Air engagement. After designing the proposed midcourse guidance law using three dimensional point mass formulation it has been validated through detailed realistic six degrees of freedom simulation. During terminal phase only proportional navigation guidance have been used. The calculation of optimal altitude in present guidance law has been carried out using Newton's method, which needs generally one iteration for convergence and suitable for real-Time implementation. Extended Kalman filter based estimator has been used for obtaining evader kinetic information from both radar and seeker noisy measurements available during midcourse and terminal guidance. The data link look angle constraint due to hardware limitation which affects the performance of midcourse guidance has also been incorporated in guidance law design. Robustness of complete simulation has been carried out through Monte Carlo studies. Extension of launch boundary due to singular perturbation over proportional navigation guidance at a given altitude for a typical engagement has also been reported. © 2017, DESIDOC.},

abstract={Survivin, as an anti-apoptotic protein and a cell cycle regulator, is recently gaining importance for its regenerative potential in salvaging injured hypoxic cells of vital organs such as heart. Different strategies are being employed to upregulate survivin expression in dying hypoxic cardiomyocytes. We investigated the cardioprotective potential of a cell permeable survivin mutant protein SurR9C84A, for the management of hypoxia mediated cardiomyocyte apoptosis, in a novel and clinically relevant model employing primary human cardiomyocytes (HCM). The aim of this research work was to study the efficacy and mechanism of SurR9C84A facilitated cardioprotection and regeneration in hypoxic HCM. To mimic hypoxic microenvironment in vitro, well characterized HCM were treated with 100 µm (48 h) cobalt chloride to induce hypoxia. Hypoxia induced (HI) HCM were further treated with SurR9C84A (1 µg/mL) in order to analyse its cardioprotective efficacy. Confocal microscopy showed rapid internalization of SurR9C84A and scanning electron microscopy revealed the reinstatement of cytoskeleton projections in HI HCM. SurR9C84A treatment increased cell viability, reduced cell death via, apoptosis (Annexin-V assay), and downregulated free cardiac troponin T and MMP-9 expression. SurR9C84A also upregulated the expression of proliferation markers (PCNA and Ki-67) and downregulated mitochondrial depolarization and ROS levels thereby, impeding cell death. Human Apoptosis Array further revealed that SurR9C84A downregulated expression of pro-apoptotic markers and augmented expression of HSPs and HTRA2/Omi. SurR9C84A treatment led to enhanced levels of survivin, VEGF, PI3K and pAkt. SurR9C84A proved non-toxic to normoxic HCM, as validated through unaltered cell proliferation and other marker levels. Its pre-treatment exhibited lesser susceptibility to hypoxia/damage. SurR9C84A holds a promising clinical potential for human cardiomyocyte survival and proliferation following hypoxic injury. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Cadmium (Cd), classified as human carcinogen, is an extremely toxic heavy metal pollutant, and there is an increasing environmental concern for cadmium exposure through anthropogenic sources including cigarette smoke. Though Cd based nanoparticles such as cadmium oxide (CdO) are being widely used in a variety of clinical and industrial applications, the toxicity of CdO nanoparticles has not been well characterized. Herein we report the toxicity of CdO nanoparticles employing zebrafish as a model. Two different CdO nanoparticles were prepared, calcination of Cd(OH)2 without any organic molecule (CdO-1) and calcination of Cd-citrate coordination polymer (CdO-2), to evaluate and compare the toxicity of these two different CdO nanoparticles. Results show that zebrafish exposed to CdO-2 nanoparticles expressed reduced toxicity as judged by lower oxidative stress levels, rescue of liver carboxylesterases and reduction in metallothionein activity compared to CdO-1 nanoparticles. Histopathological observations also support our contention that CdO-1 nanoparticles showed higher toxicity relative to CdO-2 nanoparticles. The organic unit of Cd-citrate coordination polymer might have converted into carbon during calcination that might have covered the surface of CdO nanoparticles. This carbon surface coverage can control the release of Cd2+ ions in CdO-2 compared to non-covered CdO-1 nanoparticles and hence mitigate the toxicity in the case of CdO-2. This was supported by atomic absorption spectrophotometer analyses of Cd2+ ions release from CdO-1 and CdO-2 nanoparticles. Thus the present study clearly demonstrates the toxicity of CdO nanoparticles in an aquatic animal and also indicates that the toxicity could be substantially reduced by carbon coverage. This could have important implications in terms of anthropogenic release and environmental pollution caused by Cd and human exposure to Cd2+ from sources such as cigarette smoke. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The spin transfer torque assisted magnetization switching in a pentalayer nanopillar device is theoretically studied for different biasing configurations. The magnetization switching time is calculated for three different configurations (standard(no biasing), pinned layer biasing and free layer biasing), by numerically solving the governing dynamical Landau–Lifshitz–Gilbert–Slonczewski (LLGS) equation. The corresponding switching time for an applied current density of 3×1011Am−2 is about 0.296 ns, 0.195 ns, and 0.108 ns respectively. Pinned layer biasing and free layer biasing increase the magnetization switching speed significantly. Reduction of switching time in the pinned layer biasing is due to the enhancement of spin transfer torque, whereas in the free layer biasing it is due to an additional magnetic torque which arises due to an applied magnetic field. The fastest magnetization switching is achieved for the free layer biasing configuration. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Diabetes is a systemic disease mainly characterized by chronic hyperglycemia and with extensive and long-lasting spiteful complications in central nervous systems (CNS). Astrocytes play an important role in the defense mechanism of CNS, with great ability of withstanding accumulation of toxic substances. Apart from functional disorders, hyperglycemia leads to slow progressive structural abnormalities in the CNS through oxidative stress pathways. However, the molecular mechanism by which neurons die under oxidative stress induced by high glucose (HG) remains largely unclear. Here, we report that HG-induced inflammation and neurodegeneration in brain tissues, brain astrocytes (C6), and pheochromocytoma (PC-12) cells are cultured in HG conditions. Our results show that the increases in phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2MAPK are associated with increased accumulations of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in neuronal cells, which simultaneously enhanced phosphorylations of tuberous sclerosis complex-2 (TSC-2) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in the diabetic brain and in HG-exposed neuronal cells. Pharmacologic inhibition of Akt or ERK1/2 or siRNA-mediated gene silencing of TSC-2 suppressed the strong downregulation of TSC-2-mTOR activation. Findings of this study also demonstrate that HG resulted in phosphorylation of NF-κB, coinciding with the increased production of inflammatory mediators and activation of neurodegenerative markers. Pretreatment of cells with antioxidants, phosphoinositide3-kinase (PI3-K)/Akt, and ERK1/2 inhibitors significantly reduced HG-induced TSC-2 phosphorylation and restored NF-κB protein expression leading to decreased production of inflammatory mediators and neurodegenerative markers. These results illustrate that ROS functions as a key signaling component in the regulatory pathway induced by elevated glucose in neuronal cell activation leading to inflammation and neurodegeneration. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Additive manufacturing via the direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) route is an attractive technology for repair and refurbishment of gas turbine components. This paper presents the study of the role of various process parameters such as laser power, scan speed, layer thickness and powder variability in obtaining dense, pore-free parts of CoCrMo using the DMLS route. The variation in surface roughness of the built samples and the effect of powder variability on the part density were brought out via a systematic design of experiments (DOE). Different solution heat treatments were carried out to establish the recrystallization behavior of DMLS CoCrMo. The variation in microstructure and properties were evaluated between powders from two different sources, EOS and Praxair, as an important aspect towards practical applicability of the process for components.

abstract={Chicken IgY antibody has been extensively reported for various applications as an alternative to mammalian IgG. To evaluated the pharmacokinetics profile of chicken IgY in comparison with horse IgG. Chicken IgY antibody was prepared by immunizing the white leghorn chicken with tetanus toxoid (TT) and then extracted anti-TT-IgY from immune egg yolks by PEG-6000 extraction. The titer of anti-TT-IgY was determined by ELISA in order to select the hyper immune eggs for further extraction. Rabbits were injected with 300 μg/kg of Chicken IgY and horse IgG by intravenous (i.v.) and intramuscular (i.m.) administrations. Then, the concentrations of IgY and IgG in rabbit serum were determined using indirect ELISA. Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated using non-compartmental analysis. IgY can reach higher concentration (Cmax= 4.54 mg/L after i.m. injection) within shorter time (Tmax= 0.12 h after i.m. injection) than IgG (Cmax= 3.99 ng/mL after i.m. injection; Tmax=0.11 h after i.m. injection), while the IgY lifespan (T1/2=26.98 h and 31.98 h after i.v. and i.m. administration, respectively) in the body was comparable with IgG (T1/2=27.94 h and 29.58 h after i.v. and i.m. administration, respectively). IgY might be a promising choice as an alternative to mammalian sourced antibodies. © 2018 Zhaoxiang Zhou, Jian Wang, Song Gao, Hao Ren, Wenyan Xie, Diraviyam Thirumalai, Xiaoying Zhang.},

abstract={The demand for genomic signal processing is growing drastically due to the importance of human genetics and allied sciences. This paper exemplify the genomic signal processing through handling gene data sequence from gene data bank, converting them in to sequences, transforming them in to frequency domain, spectrogram visualization and analysis in detail. The frequency domain conversion from the time domain gene sequence is carried out using Goertzel algorithm instead of conventional fast Fourier transform (FFT). This algorithm requires only few resources as compared to the conventional FFT method. The spectrogram of the patients who are affected with Ebola virus is also plotted for further analysis. This would produce the power spectrum (y-axis) versus the time (x-axis) results. All simulation results are obtained using Matlab and Simulink software tools. © 2017, Scientific Publishers of India.

abstract={The influence of upstream and downstream flow and its effect due to the operating wind turbine at various wind speeds are important in considering the wind turbine spacing in a turbine park. In this research paper study is made towards what extent the wind turbine with a rotor diameter D, influences the flow in upstream and downstream computationally. The reduction in the maximum power coefficient strongly depends on the distance between the turbines and the operating condition of the upstream turbine. Presently, the standard power curve measurements assumes that the turbine wind condition has negligible influence on the flow at two times the rotor diameter upstream. However, the upstream effect due to the operating wind turbine beyond two times the rotor diameter (2D) leads to the consequences of the power estimate for any given turbine and this leads to the wind farm for total power production. Similarly, the downstream of the operating wind turbine is equally important in terms of the power production of the wind turbine park. Numerical simulations are performed on a wind turbine with a rotor diameter of 80 m and the tower height of 100 m with various blade pitch angles. The NACA-63-425 aerofoil is selected for the blade profile in this analysis. The result shows that the influence of the pitch angle will not influence much difference in upstream flow and much difference in the downstream flow. However, at the distance more than two times (> 2D) of the rotor diameter upstream around 3% change in the velocity is observed when compared to the free stream velocity. In the downstream, velocity the influence of operating wind turbine extends up to 6.5D for a velocity of 20m\s. © 2017, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop a statistical model for delamination and thrust forcing during drilling of carbon-fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites using response surface methodology (RSM) to determine the input parameters (drill speed, drill diameter and feed rate) that influences the output response (delamination and thrust force) in the machining of CFRP composite using solid carbide drill cutter. Design/methodology/approach - Three factors, three levels central composite face centred (CCFC) design, is used to conduct the experiments on CFRP by carbide drill. The whole quality evaluation (delamination) was done by video measuring system to measure the width of maximum damage of the machined CFRP composite. The thrust forces during drilling are measured using digital multi-component cutting force (Make: IEICOS, Model: 652) dynamometer. The "Design Expert 7.0" is used to analyse the data collected graphically. An analysis of variance is carried out to validate the model and for determining the most significant parameter. Findings - The response surface model is used to predict the input factors influencing the delamination and thrust force on the drilled surfaces of CFRP composite at different cutting conditions with the chosen range of 95 per cent confidence intervals. The analysis on the influences of the entire individual input machining parameters on the delamination and thrust force has been carried out using RSM. This investigation revealed that the drill diameter is the eminent factor which affects the responses. Originality/value - In all, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5 mm holes have been successfully made on CFRP using vertical machining center, whereas the previous researchers have not drilled hole size less than 1 mm in CFRP using vertical machining center. © 2017 Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Synthesis of titanium dioxide nanoparticles is gaining more importance in the field of nanotechnology due to their application in the gas/vapor sensing field. The present study deals with the synthesis of titanium dioxide nanoparticles from titanium isopropoxide solution using various ionic liquids as phase tuning agents. XRD results revealed the crystalline nature and presence of anatase and rutile phases of synthesized titanium dioxide nanoparticles. The shape and size of the particles were analyzed using TEM and SEM images, which indicated their morphology. The adhesion of dip-coated thin films was obtained from contact angle measurements and correlated with surface roughness. The gas sensing ability of the synthesized titanium dioxide nanoparticles was tested by checking the level of chemisorption and measuring the change in resistance of the samples in the presence and absence of gas inside an airtight chamber and plotting it as a function of time. The sensing studies performed on the samples showed that the TiO2 samples with ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate [EMIM·PF6], with the highest anatase phase percentage, displayed the best ammonia sensing. The results suggest that the sol-gel prepared TiO2 acts as an excellent gas sensor and on adding ionic liquid, the performance is further enhanced. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={Nitrated fatty acids (NO2-FAs) act as anti-inflammatory signal mediators, albeit the molecular mechanisms behind NO2-FAs’ influence on diverse metabolic and signaling pathways in inflamed tissues are essentially elusive. Here, we combine fluorescence measurements with surface-specific sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy and coarse-grained computer simulations to demonstrate that NO2-FAs alter lipid organization by accumulation at the membrane–water interface. As the function of membrane proteins strongly depends on both, protein structure as well as membrane properties, we consecutively follow the structural dynamics of an integral membrane protein in presence of NO2-FAs. Based on our results, we suggest a molecular mechanism of the NO2-FA in vivo activity: Driven by the NO2-FA-induced lipid layer reorganization, the structure and function of membrane-associated (signaling) proteins is indirectly affected. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

abstract={Silicon is among the most abundant elements on the Earth. It occurs in many minerals and plays an important role in several biochemical processes. Some living organisms use silicon dioxide as a substrate for building elements of their bodies. Unicellular diatom algae build frustules from silicon dioxide. The skeleton of siliceous sponges is a silica-protein composite. Similarly, rice hulls which protect seeds, contain silica as an important component. The living organisms assimilate silicon from the environment in the form of silicic acid. However, the biochemical mechanisms involved in the transformation of silicic acid to solid siliceous materials are still poorly understood. Evidently, condensation of silicic acid in the living organisms proceeds under control of biopolymers and it is important to know how various types of polymers influence the condensation. Bio-inspired chemistry involving the interaction between polymeric silicic acid and functional polymers results in interesting composite materials, including nanoparticles and bulk materials. This review contains a brief description of the mechanism of silicic acid condensation in aqueous medium and also includes a discussion on various precursors of silicic acid. The main focus of the review is on the influence of polymers bearing nitrogen and oxygen-containing functional groups on silicic acid condensation starting from monomer to three-dimensional polymer. Influence of molecular weight of the organic polymer on the condensation and structure of the resulting product is also elaborated. The biological importance of the obtained data and strategies for novel applications of the synthesized composite materials are described in the concluding section of the review. The biomimetic condensation processes open up new vistas for development of novel materials and applications in the biomedical and process industries. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={Radar exploration supports glaciological studies playing several roles in ice exploration such as determining ice thickness and volume, describing ice and snow internal layering and characterizing crevassed areas. The method, widely used with full success on Polar areas, encounters more difficulties when applied to survey mountain glaciers like the Alpine and Himalayan ones. Among them, these difficulties can be addressed to the different physical characteristics of temperate ice and to logistic difficulties related to performing field operations at high elevations on areas where crevasses, seracs and ice-falls are present, making more complicate and complex the glacier surface. In the framework of the SHARE-PAPRIKA and the SHARE-STELVIO Projects, we performed some preliminary measurements on Careser, Sforzellina and Forni glaciers (Ortles-Cevedale Group, Italy), to evaluate efficiency and applicability of a Radio Echo Sounding (RES) instrument specifically designed, developed and modified by the INGV (Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia) laboratories. This paper reports the results we obtained investigating each glacier, the hampering factors and the cost to benefit ratio introduced by the airborne survey. © 2017 by Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia.

abstract={Due to the advancement of mobile technology, a large number of computationally intensive applications are created for smart phones. But the limitations of battery and processing power of smart phones are making it inferior to laptops and desktop computers. Mobile Cloud Offloading (MCO) allows the smart phones to offload computationally intensive tasks to the cloud, making it more effective in terms of energy, speed or both. Increased networking capacity due to the availability of high speed Wi-Fi and cellular connections like 3G/4G makes offloading more efficient. Even then, the choice of offloading is not always advisable, because of the highly dynamic context information of mobile devices and clouds. In this paper, we propose a dynamic decision making system, which will decide whether to offload or do the tasks locally, depending on the current context information and the optimization choice of the user. Metrics are developed for time, energy and combination of time and energy to assess the proposed system. A test bed is implemented and the results are showing improvements from the currently existing methods. © 2017-IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The present study was carried out with the specific aim to evaluate anti-Helicobacter pylori (Hp) and urease inhibitory activities of three flavonoids, namely 5-hydroxy-7,4′-dimethoxy-6,8-di-C-methylflavone (1), kaempferol-3-O-β-d-glucopyranoside (2) and kaempferol-3-O-α-l-rhamnopyranoside (3), of Syzygium alternifolium fruits. These flavonoids were examined for anti-H. pylori activity against two Hp strains, Hp 26695 and Hp P12, through a microbroth dilution assay with a time kill kinetics study and also the evaluation of their ability to lower H. pylori colonization with AGS (gastric epidermal cells). In addition, a urease inhibition assay was performed with these compounds, followed by 2D QSAR, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations on these compounds with target proteins, urease and cytotoxin associated gene (Cag A). The in vitro studies showed that compounds 2 and 3 show significant anti-H. pylori activity whereas compound 1 exhibits moderate activity when compared to amoxicillin and that these compounds also show strong bactericidal kinetics in a time dependent manner. These compounds potentially reduce the H. pylori colonization with a significant loss of its adhesion with AGS cells and inhibit the Hp urease activity. 2D QSAR analysis reveals that these compounds exhibit an acceptable correlation of RMSE = 0.905 and R2 = 0.820 with the biological assays. The compounds show strong inhibitions by forming H-bonding interactions with the active pocket residues of the target proteins as evidenced by 10 ns molecular dynamics simulations. Hence, the current investigation will provide a new vision for the discovery of potent antimicrobial agents from natural sources against H. pylori infections. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={In this paper, a new operational matrix of variable-order fractional derivative (OMVFD) is derived for the second kind Chebyshev wavelets (SKCWs). Moreover, a new optimization wavelet method based on SKCWs is proposed to solve multi variable-order fractional differential equations (MV-FDEs). In the proposed method, the solution of the problem under consideration is expanded in terms of SKCWs. Then, the residual function and its errors in 2-norm are employed for converting the problem under study to an optimization one, which optimally chooses the unknown coefficients. Finally, the method of constrained extremum is applied, which consists of adjoining the constraint equations obtained from the given initial conditions to the object function obtained from residual function by a set of unknown Lagrange multipliers. The main advantage of this approach is that it reduces such problems to those optimization problems, which greatly simplifies them and also leads to obtain a good approximate solution for them.},

abstract={Ganoderma lucidum total triterpenes were evaluated for its apoptosis-inducing and anti-cancer activities. Cytotoxicity and pro-apoptotic effect of total triterpenes were evaluated in human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7) cell line using MTT assay and DNA fragmentation analysis. Total triterpenes induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells by down-regulating the levels of cyclin D1, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and also by up-regulating the levels of Bax and caspase-9. Anti-carcinogenicity of total triterpenes was analysed using dimethyl benz [a] anthracene (DMBA) induced skin papilloma and mammary adenocarcinoma in Swiss albino mice and Wistar rats respectively. Topical application of 5 mg, 10 mg and 20 mg total triterpenes reduced the incidence of skin papilloma by 62.5, 37.5 and 12.5% respectively. Incidence of the mammary tumour was also reduced significantly by 33.33, 66.67 and 16.67% in 10, 50 and 100 mg/kg b.wt. total triterpenes treated animals respectively. Total triterpenes were also found to reduce the average number of tumours per animal and extended the tumour latency period in both the models. The results indicate the potential cytotoxicity and anti-cancerous activity of total triterpenes, there by opens up a path to the development of a safe and successive chemo preventive agent of natural origin. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

Heart rate monitoring using RGB videos is inefficient in outdoor environment because light has significant impact on RGB videos. This approach introduces a heart rate measuring strategy using LAB color facial video. Here we have to note that blood circulation causes variation in facial skin color and heart rate can be extracted through these variations. Heart rate is subsequently measured and compared with a reference measurement.

abstract={Triphenylphosphoniumfluorenylide (TPPFY), a fluorescent fluorene attached molecule, showed polymorphism and benzene solvent induced aggregation enhanced emission (AEE) in the solid state. Crystallization from CH3CN produced non-fluorescent crystals of TPPFY (TPPFY-1), whereas intense yellow fluorescent crystals (plates and blocks) were obtained from benzene (TPPFY-2, λmax = 538 nm, Φf = 38%). Structural analysis indicates that TPPFY-1 exhibits strong π⋯π interactions (3.371-3.399 Å) between fluorene units in the crystal lattice that quenched the solid state fluorescence. In contrast, the inclusion of a benzene molecule in TPPFY-2 prevents the close packing of fluorophores and shows intense yellow fluorescence in the solid state. TPPFY-2 showed only weak C-H⋯π interactions between fluorene and the phenyl group of triphenylphosphoniumylide. Hirshfeld surface analysis further supported the differences in the intermolecular interactions and molecular packing between TPPFY-1 and TPPFY-2. Interestingly, heating/strong crushing irreversibly converts fluorescent TPPFY-2 crystals to non-fluorescent TPPFY-1 crystals. However, recrystallization of TPPFY-1 from benzene produced fluorescent TPPFY-2 crystals. Thus TPPFY displays reversible off-on fluorescence switching heating/crushing and recrystallization. PXRD studies confirmed the polymorphism as well as the phase conversion of TPPFY-2 to TPPFY-1 by external stimuli. This study indicates the role of the benzene molecule in controlling the molecular packing and functional properties of TPPFY. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={Background: Curcumin is a yellow polyphenolic chemopreventive agent isolated from the rhizomes of Curcuma longa. It is approved as Generally Regarded as Safe by US FDA. Nonetheless, its clinical success is limited due to its poor aqueous solubility, fast metabolism and short biological half-life attributes. Objective: Quercetin-decorated liposomes of curcumin (QCunp) are perceived to be able to overcome these biopharmaceutical drawbacks. Methods: Curcumin liposomes with/without quercetin were prepared by lipid hydration technique. The liposomes were characterized for their particle size, zeta potential, surface morphology, drug loading and release characteristics. The toxicity of the liposomes were evaluated in-vitro and their in-vivo efficacy were tested against Dalton’s ascites lymphoma in mice. Results: Liposomes designed showed particle size of 261.8 ± 2.1 nm with a negative zeta potential of -22.6±1.6 mV. Quercetin decorated liposomes were more effective in increasing the life span and body weight of lymphoma inflicted mice compared to those without quercetin. Similarly, the presence of quercetin also contributed to enhanced cytotoxicity of the liposomal formulation towards HT-29 cells and HCT-15 cells. Conclusion: Newer liposomal design exhibited promising potential to emerge as alternative anti-cancer therapeutics. © 2017 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={Customers are the major stakeholders and their satisfaction forms the basis of the sustainable competitive advantage of the firm. Attracting, satisfying and retaining customers lead to extended customer base and increased profit margins. Thus, the customer satisfaction is the ultimate objective of the firm which is possible by rendering quality service. The State Bank of India (SBI) ranks as 67th in the list of largest banks in the world based on market capitalization as of March 31th 2014. The quality of service extended by the SBI has resulted in customer satisfaction and expanded customer base for the bank. Random sampling method is adopted for the collection of data from the respondents. In Tiruchirappalli regional office of State Bank of India, area operations are selected within 10 Kilometer radius from the Main branch and 60 questionnaires per branch have been distributed in 10 branches. Out of 600 questionnaires, 109 are found incomplete and 491 are fully complete with 81.83% of response rate. The data collected were analysed with the help of MS Excel to identify the gaps. The Cronbach alpha, a measure of internal consistency obtained is 0.925 which is considered to be excellent. This study aims to identify the gaps in the dimensions of service quality by administering SERVQUAL model among the customers in State Bank of India. An overall weighted SERVQUAL score of –1.42866 was arrived, representing a significant inconsistency in meeting customer expectations across all service dimensions. Highest gap scores for reliability and empathy depicts that there is a need for courtesy and politeness among SBI employees which in turn will help to establish a long term relationship with the customers. The relatively low gap scores were found for responsiveness, tangibles and assurance dimensions. The State Bank of India has to take steps to close the gaps and it can be closed by establishing and implementing a service quality information system. © 2014 The Authors. Published by VGTU Press.},

abstract={We identify the mechanism behind the existence of intensity-induced chimera states in globally coupled oscillators. We find that the effect of intensity in the system is to cause multistability by increasing the number of fixed points. This in turn increases the number of multistable attractors, and we find that their stability is determined by the strength of coupling. This causes the coexistence of different collective states in the system depending upon the initial state. We demonstrate that intensity-induced chimera is generic to both periodic and chaotic systems. We discuss possible applications of our results to real-world systems like the brain and spin torque nano-oscillators. © 2014 American Physical Society.},

abstract={Experiments were carried out on preparation and characterization of ZnO-ethylene glycol (EG) and ZnO-ethylene glycol-water nanofluids and analysis of their performance as coolants. Favorable interactions between ZnO nanoparticles and ethylene glycol molecules ensured superior transport properties of ZnO-EG nanofluids. These interactions were utilized during formulation of ZnO-EG-water nanofluids with preservation of ethylene glycol molecules over ZnO nanoparticles' surface rendering them with better transport properties. ZnO-EG nanofluids containing 4. vol.% nanoparticles showed thermal conductivity enhancement of 33.4% and viscosity reduction of 39.2% at 27. °C. Similarly, 2. vol.% ZnO-EG-water nanofluids showed thermal conductivity enhancement of 17.26% and viscosity reduction of 17.34% at 27. °C. Disturbance of hydrogen bonding network of ethylene glycol by ZnO nanoparticles resulted in reduced dispersion viscosity. Empirical models were developed to predict the thermal conductivity enhancement and viscosity reduction of the nanofluids apart from elucidating mechanisms for the same. Transient heat transfer experiments showed that ZnO-EG and ZnO-EG-water nanofluids had better heat absorption characteristics compared to their respective base fluids. The enhancements in heat transfer were proportional to thermal conductivity enhancements, which showed that superior thermal conductivity of nanofluids could be harnessed for cooling applications. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={A network designed by the number of sensor nodes, senses the data from the environment, processes the data and routes it to the sink via the Cluster head (CH) and the group of intermediate nodes. The routing is carried out by these intermediate nodes efficiently from the source to the destination. To perform this transmission accurately, there are a number of issues to be considered, wherein the reliability issues and routing overhead are the key concern considered in this paper. A novel technique named "Efficient Neighbor Coverage Routing Protocol" (ENCRP) is proposed in this paper. This in turn reduces the routing overhead by using some proposed techniques such as finding rebroadcast delay and connectivity factor. This enables an efficient packet transmission among these nodes. Our result shows that the proposed routing technique has better performance by considering the metrics such as Throughput, Energy Utilization, Packet delivery ratio and End-to-end delay compared to Dual Homed Routing (DHR) Protocol.},

abstract={Direct association of dry eye syndrome and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a well established fact. In this context, the current study examines the invitro corneal inflammatory response with respect to HCV core and NS3 antigens. Toll like receptors (TLRs) are pattern recognition receptors which can mediate innate immune response. In the present study, corneal epithelial cells responded to HCV core and NS3 proteins by secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-8, IL-6 and TNF-α via TLR1, TLR2 and TLR6 mediated innate immune response. MyD88/NF-kB signalling was involved in pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Corneal epithelium synthesised nitric oxide (NO) via iNOS during HCV core and NS3 exposure. On later stages of inflammation, cells underwent apoptosis which lead to cell death. SiRNA mediated silencing of TLR1, TLR2 and TLR6 resulted in a significant down regulation of IL-8 and NO. In conclusion, this study indicates that HCV core and NS3 proteins are capable of inducing immune response in corneal epithelium which can potentiate the pathology of HCV associated dry eye condition. Blocking specific TLR response can have therapeutic application in controlling the inflammatory response associated with this dry eye condition. © 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Flooding is a naturally recurrent phenomenon that causes severe damage to lives and property. Predictions on flood-prone zones are made based on intensity-duration of rainfall, carrying capacity of drainage, and natural or man-made obstructions. Particularly, the lower part of the drainage system and its adjacent geomorphic landforms like floodplains and deltaic plains are considered for analysis, but stagnation in parts of basins that are far away from major riverine systems is less unveiled. Similarly, uncharacteristic flooding in the upper and middle parts of drainage, especially in zones of an anomalous drainage pattern, is also least understood. Even though topographic differences are attributed for such anomalous spatial occurrence of floods, its genetic cause has to be identified for effective management practice. Added to structural and lithological variations, tectonic movements too impart micro-scale terrain undulations. Because active tectonic movements are slow-occurring, long-term geological processes, its resultant topographical variations and drainage anomalies are least correlated with floods. The recent floods of Tamil Nadu also exhibit a unique distribution pattern emphasizing the role of tectonics over it. Hence a detailed geoinformatics-based analysis was carried out to envisage the relationship between spatial distribution of flood and active tectonic elements such as regional arches and deeps, block faults, and graben and drainage anomalies such as deflected drainage, compressed meander, and eyed drainages. The analysis reveals that micro-scale topographic highs and lows imparted by active tectonic movements and its further induced drainage anomalies have substantially controlled the distribution pattern of flood. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Antibacterial studies of Cu2O with different morphologies showed that Cu2O crystals dispersed in liquid are highly effective against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria whereas, when tested by the agar diffusion method, they were effective only against Bacillus subtilis. All six morphologies exhibited a similar effect, and the antibacterial effect could possibly be attributed to the altered membrane permeability caused by the Cu2O micro/nanocrystals. Comparatively higher membrane permeability was observed in the case of Gram-negative bacteria relative to Gram-positive bacteria. © the Partner Organisations 2014.},

To exploit levan in nanotechnology, we present a simple and greener method to synthesize silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) using biopolymer, levan as both reducing and stabilizing agents. The morphology and stability of the AgNPs and AuNPs were examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and UV-vis absorption (UV-vis) spectroscopy. The possible capping mechanism of the nanoparticles was postulated using FTIR studies.

Hydrophobicity and tensile stress were significantly higher in PLA-PCL (75:25), whereas tensile strain and fiber density were significantly higher in PLA-PCL (25:75). Properties such as anastomatic strength porosity, average pore size, degradation with retained fiber orientation, and thromboresistivity were comparable between blends. Human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC) adhesion on the scaffolds was observed within 24 h. Cell viability and proliferation were rationally influenced by the aligned nanofibers. Gene expression reveals the grafts thromboresistivity, elasticity, and aided neovascularization. Thus, these scaffolds could be an ideal candidate for small diameter blood vessel engineering. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

These compounds exhibited anti-cancer activity against Colo205, U937, MCF7 and A549 cancer cell lines and were more effective against the Colo205 cell line, with IC50 values ranging from 5.04-13 μM, than against other cell lines. The detailed effects of one of the promising compounds, 20c, on the biological properties of the Colo205 cell line were studied. Interestingly, compound 20c induced G2/M cell cycle arrest. The levels of p53 increased tremendously in 20c-treated Colo205 cells. The balance in levels of key mitochondrial proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bax was altered, which resulted in apoptosis by accelerating the expression of caspases. Thus, compound 20c can be considered as a potential small-molecule activator of p53, which regulates the equilibrium between rapid cell proliferation and apoptosis, and can be considered as a potential plausible candidate for further biological testing in in vivo colon cancer models. © the Partner Organisations 2014.},

abstract={This study investigated the potential of vitamin K1 against streptozotocin-induced diabetic cataract in Wistar rats. A single, intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ) (35mg/kg) resulted in hyperglycemia, accumulation of sorbitol and formation of advanced glycation end product (AGE) in eye lens. Hyperglycemia in lens also resulted in superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical generation and less reduced glutathione suggesting oxidative stress in lens. Hyperglycemia also resulted in increase in lens Ca2+ and significant inhibition of lens Ca2+ ATPase activity. These changes were associated with cataract formation in diabetic animals. By contrast treatment of diabetic rats with vitamin K1 (5mg/kg, sc, twice a week) resulted in animals with partially elevated blood glucose and with transparent lenses having normal levels of sorbitol, AGE, Ca2+ ATPase, Ca2+, and oxidative stress. Vitamin K 1 may function to protect against cataract formation in the STZ induced diabetic rat by affecting the homeostasis of blood glucose and minimizing subsequent oxidative and osmotic stress. Thus, these results show that Vitamin K1 inhibits diabetic-cataract by modulating lens Ca2+ homeostasis and its hypoglycemic effect through its direct action on the pancreas. •First report on anticataract potential of vitamin K1. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={In this article, ZnO thin film acts as a matrix to bind with a sequence specific probe strand, which is employed as a recognition element and is involved in sensing the complementary DNA of dengue virus specific serotypes. ZnO thin films possess high surface area, high catalytic efficiency with an isoelectric point of ∼9.5, thus leading to strong electrostatic attraction and strong adsorption capability towards negatively charged DNA having an isoelectric point of 4. ZnO thin film deposition is carried out by ultrasonic spray pyrolysis (USP) at the temperature of 450 °C using dry air as the carrier gas along with 0.1 M of zinc acetate as the precursor to obtain transparent films with a thickness of around 150-200 nm. X-ray diffraction data show the dominant peak corresponding to (100). The morphology of ZnO thin films was analyzed using field emission-scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) and atomic force microscope (AFM). The optical characteristics of thin films were studied using UV-spectroscopic analysis, which confirms the band gap of the film to be 3.3 eV. Further, sequence specific DNA immobilization is carried out for the bio-functionalization of ZnO thin films to detect 4 DENV serotypes, thus enabling simultaneous detection in an array having sensitivity in the range of 1 × 10-15 moles of DNA. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection remains a significant cause of mortality globally. Though antiretroviral therapy has significantly reduced AIDS-related morbidity and mortality, there are several drawbacks in the current therapy, including toxicity, drug-drug interactions, development of drug resistance, necessity for long-term drug therapy, poor bio-availability and lack of access to tissues and reservoirs. To circumvent these problems, recent anti-HIV therapeutic research has focused on improving drug delivery systems through drug delivery targeted specifically to host cells infected with HIV or could potentially get infected with HIV. In this regard, several surface molecules of both viral and host cell origin have been described in recent years, that would enable targeted drug delivery in HIV infection. In the present review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the need for novel drug delivery systems, and the successes and challenges in the identification of novel viral and host-cell molecules for the targeted drug delivery of anti-HIV drugs. Such targeted anti-retroviral drug delivery approaches could pave the way for effective treatment and eradication of HIV from the body. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Ellagic acid, a naturally occurring polyphenol was encapsulated in chitosan particles prepared by ionotropic gelation and characterized for its physicochemical properties. A maximum encapsulation efficiency of 49% was achieved. The blood clotting time and clot retraction time were calculated for different concentrations of ellagic acid, chitosan and ellagic acid-encapsulated chitosan. A reduction of 34% in the clot time and 16.4% in the retraction time was observed in ellagic acid-encapsulated chitosan when compared with free ellagic acid at concentrations as low as 0.1 mg/mL. The physical blend in comparison to free ellagic acid displayed a reduction of 13.8% and 4.6% in the clotting time and retraction time respectively under similar conditions. This suggests that the encapsulation of ellagic acid favors thrombosis due to synergistic action of chitosan and ellagic acid on same molecular targets.

abstract={Abnormal apoptosis is one of the hallmarks of cancers including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), as it plays a pivotal role in precisely maintaining self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation properties of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Caspase9 (CASP9), an initiator caspase activated by mitochondrial-mediated apoptotic pathway (intrinsic pathway), triggers cascade of effector caspases and executes apoptosis. Functional SNPs in CASP9 might influence the gene expression leading to altered apoptosis which confer the risk to AML. To test this hypothesis, we have analyzed four CASP9 gene polymorphisms [CASP9 − 1263A &gt; G (rs4645978), CASP9 − 712C &gt; T (rs4645981), CASP9 − 293_275del CGTGAGGTC AGTGCGGGGA (−293del) (rs4645982), and CASP9 Ex5 + 32G &gt; A (rs1052576)] in 180 AML cases and 304 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. We performed various statistical analyses to determine the potential interactions between these SNPs and AML. The study revealed that presence of G allele at CASP9 − 1263 position elevates the risk of AML 1.53-fold and CT/TT genotype at CASP9 − 712 position by 2.60-fold under dominant model of inheritance. Two CASP9 haplotypes, G-del+-C-A and G-del+-T-A, were found to be significantly associated with increased AML risk by 2.19- (95 % confidence interval (CI), 1.09–4.39; p = 0.028) and 11.75-fold (95 % CI, 1.01–136.57; p = 0.05), respectively. Further, multidimensionality reduction (MDR) analysis had revealed single locus CASP9 − 712C &gt; T SNP and four loci CASP9 − 1263A &gt; G, CASP9 − 293del, CASP9 − 712C &gt; T, and CASP9 Ex5 + 32G &gt; A SNPs as highest predicting models for AML development. Our results revealed a significant association of two SNPs in CASP9 (−1263A &gt; G and −712C &gt; T) and two haplotypes of the four SNP combinations with AML susceptibility. © 2014, International Society of Oncology and BioMarkers (ISOBM).},

abstract={Experiments were performed on the synthesis of magnesium oxide nanoparticles (30-40 nm), followed by their dispersion in propylene glycol to prepare stable MgO-propylene glycol nanofluids through extensive probe ultrasonication for 25 h. The influence of MgO nanoparticle concentration (0-2 vol%) and temperature on viscosity and thermal conductivity of MgO-propylene glycol nanofluids was investigated. While the relative viscosity of the nanofluid decreased with nanoparticle concentration to a temperature of 30 °C, the relative viscosity-nanoparticle concentration exhibited a minimum at 1 vol% in the temperature range of 35-60 °C. The enhancement in thermal conductivity of nanofluids increased linearly with nanoparticle concentration and was found to be independent of temperature, with an average enhancement of ∼20% for 2 vol% MgO-propylene glycol nanofluid. Our results show that the thermal conductivity enhancement in MgO-propylene glycol can be attributed to both interfacial layering and Brownian motion.

The study used chemically synthesized ZnO NPs and characterized by using UV-visible spectrophotometer, scanning electron microscopy, particle size analyzer and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. The mean diameter of the particles was found to be 55 ± 1.2. nm. The XRD patterns exhibited hexagonal structure for ZnO NPs. The photocatalytic property of ZnO NPs was evaluated based on the UV-vis spectra changes of the methylene blue solution as a function of reaction time in the presence of ZnO NPs under visible light.

abstract={Hemoglobin is an honorary enzyme, a two-way respiratory carrier, transporting oxygen from the lungs to the tissues and facilitating the return transport of carbon dioxide. Hemoglobin has high affinity for oxygen and low affinity for carbon dioxide and other substances in the arterial circulation, whereas in the venous circulation these relative affinities are upturned. The oxygen affinity of hemoglobin increases with the fall in temperature and decreases with the increase in pH and 2, 3-bisphosphoglycerate; point mutations also affect the tetrameric arrangement and alter the oxygen affinity. Though several studies have revealed the specific reasons for the adaptation of increased oxygen affinity of avian hemoglobins at high-altitudes, further structural insights on hemoglobins from high oxygen affinity species are required to understand the detailed oxygen adaptation at the molecular level. Herein, we describe the structural investigation of hemoglobin from emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae), a high oxygen affinity bird. Hemoglobin from emu was purified using anion-exchange chromatography, crystallized and determined the structure in the oxy form at a resolution of 2.3 A; the R-factor of the model was 19.2%. The structure was compared with other oxy hemoglobins of high oxygen affinity avian species; significant changes are noted at intra-subunit contacts which provide the clues for increased oxygen affinity of emu hemoglobin.},

abstract={Malaria is a major public health problem in tropical and subtropical countries, including India. This study elucidates the cause of chloroquine treatment failure (for Plasmodium falciparum infection) before the introduction of artemisinin combination therapy. One hundred twenty-six patients were randomized to chloroquine treatment, and the therapeutic efficacy was monitored from days 1 to 28. An in vitro susceptibility test was performed with all isolates. Parasitic DNA was isolated, followed by PCR and restriction digestion of different codons of the pfcrt gene (codons 72 to 76) and the pfmdr1 gene (N86Y, Y184F, S1034C, N1042D, and D1246Y). Finally, sequencing was done to confirm the mutations. Forty-three (34.13%) early treatment failure cases and 16 (12.69%) late treatment failure cases were observed after chloroquine treatment. In vitro chloroquine resistance was found in 103 isolates (81.75%). Twenty-six (60.47%) early treatment failure cases and 6 (37.5%) late treatment failure cases were associated with the CVMNK-YYSNY allele (the underlined amino acids are those that were mutated). Moreover, the CVIEK-YYSNY allele was found in 8 early treatment failure (18.60%) and 2 late treatment failure (12.5%) cases. The presence of the wild-type pfcrt (CVMNK) and pfmdr1 (YYSNY) double mutant allele in chloroquine-nonresponsive cases was quite uncommon. In vivo chloroquine treatment failure and in vitro chloroquine resistance were strongly correlated with the CVMNK-YYSNY and CVIEK-YYSNY haplotypes (P < 0.01).Copyright © 2014 American Society for Microbiology.

Kinetics of adsorption follows pseudo-second order rather than pseudo-first-order kinetic model. The pH of the interaction medium influenced the adsorption process.

abstract={Purpose: Dry eye condition is an extrahepatic manifestation associated with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Since conjunctival inflammation can contribute to the dry eye condition, in the present study we analyzed the conjunc-tival inflammatory response to HCV core and NS3 proteins.
Methods: We used primary human conjunctival fbroblasts for our study. Cytokines were measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Toll-like receptor (TLR) and cell adhesion molecule gene expression patterns were analyzed with semiquantitative reverse transcription (RT)–PCR. Immunofuorescence staining was performed for the MyD88, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) proteins. Nitric oxide (NO) was measured with the Griess assay; terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated uridine 5′-triphosphate-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays were performed for apoptosis and cell viability, respectively.
Results: When exposed to the HCV core and NS3 proteins, the conjunctival fbroblasts secreted interleukin-8 (IL-8), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and IL-10 in a dose-dependent manner. Various TLRs were involved in the innate immune response via MyD88 signaling without NF-kB involvement. The gene expression of cell adhesion molecules such as CD44 and ICAM-1 was upregulated, and the cells secreted NO via iNOS. As the sum of these stress responses, the cells underwent apoptosis, which eventually lead to cell death.
Conclusions: HCV core and NS3 proteins induced conjunctival inflammation that may form the pathogenesis of dry eye condition. © 2014 Molecular Vision.},

abstract={The influence of multiple substituents (F, CH3, NO2, CN, Cl, OH and NH2) on the C-H⋯φ interaction in benzene-ethylene complex was investigated using the estimated CCSD(T) method and complete basis set limit. The results were compared with our earlier reported complexes of benzene-acetylene and benzene-methane, thus completing the sp, sp2 and sp3 series of C-H donors. The stabilization energy values for multiple fluoro-substituted benzene-ethylene complexes are found to be very close to those of the multiple fluoro-substituted benzene-methane complexes. Expectedly, the stabilization energies for the multiple methyl-substituted benzene-ethylene complexes lie between those of the multiple methyl-substituted benzene-methane and benzene- acetylene complexes. Energy decomposition analysis using the DFT-SAPT method predicts the dispersion energy to be dominant, similar to the benzene-methane complexes. For the symmetrically disubstituted complexes (-OH, -Cl, -NH2, -CN and -NO2), additional C-H⋯X interaction was observed, possibly due to the angular orientation of the ethylene molecule. Multidimensional correlation analysis between the electrostatic, dispersion and exchangerepulsion with the C-H⋯φ interaction distance (r), Hammett constant (σ) and the molar refractivity (MR) revealed strong correlation between dispersion energy and the C-H⋯φ interaction distance (r) as well as molar refractivity (MR). © 2014 American Chemical Society.},

But, the use of flavonoid-metal ion complexes as sensors remains an unexplored facet. The present work attempts to develop a non-enzymatic superoxide sensor using naringin-copper complex. Detection of superoxide has been mainly based on enzymes and cytochromes. However, these sensors are limited by their poor structural stability and high cost. The naringin-copper based non-enzymatic sensor exhibits good sensitivity in a range of 0.2-4.2. μM with a response time of <1. s. The performance of the sensor is not affected by pH and common interferents. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={With the successful clinical trials, multifunctional glycoprotein bovine lactoferrin is gaining attention as a safe nutraceutical and biologic drug targeting cancer, chronic-inflammatory, viral and microbial diseases. Interestingly, recent findings that human lactoferrin oligomerizes under simulated physiological conditions signify the possible role of oligomerization in the multifunctional activities of lactoferrin molecule during infections and in disease targeting signaling pathways. Here we report the purification and physicochemical characterization of high molecular weight biomacromolecular complex containing bovine lactoferrin (≥250 kDa), from bovine colostrum, a naturally enriched source of lactoferrin. It showed structural similarities to native monomeric iron free (Apo) lactoferrin (∼78-80 kDa), retained anti-bovine lactoferrin antibody specific binding and displayed potential receptor binding properties when tested for cellular internalization. It further displayed higher thermal stability and better resistance to gut enzyme digestion than native bLf monomer. High molecular weight bovine lactoferrin was functionally bioactive and inhibited significantly the cell proliferation (p<0.01) of human breast and colon carcinoma derived cells. It induced significantly higher cancer cell death (apoptosis) and cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner in cancer cells than the normal intestinal cells. Upon cellular internalization, it led to the up-regulation of caspase-3 expression and degradation of actin. In order to identify the cutting edge future potential of this bio-macromolecule in medicine over the monomer, its in-depth structural and functional properties need to be investigated further. © 2014 Ebrahim et al.},

Absorption studies showed the complete disappearance of 1-AgNPs peak at 426nm due to the conversion of AgNPs to silver ions. The presence silver ions were confirmed by white precipitates of AgCl formation with NaCl. The interference studies confirmed the high selectivity of NO2- sensing in presence of anions as well as cations by 1-AgNPs. A linear relationship was observed between the change of absorption and concentration of NO2-. The present approach could be performed at room temperature and ambient conditions.

abstract={Nanomaterials have been widely used for nanomedicinal applications due to their unique properties such as small size, large surface area for biofunctionalization, high reactivity for ligand conjugation, capability to penetrate the cell membrane, and in vivo distribution. As such, these nanoparticles (NPs) have diverse applications for drug delivery, clinical diagnostics, biological imaging, and treating various diseases. In spite of the success achieved so far, accumulating evidence suggests that these diverse formulations of nanomaterials may impose cytotoxic effects on the cardiovascular system. There are, however, currently no conclusive data or standard analytical methods to establish that the present levels of nanomaterials are likely or unlikely to impose any adverse effects on public health. This chapter gives a brief overview of the emerging role of nanotechnology in cardiovascular medicine, illustrates the fundamental cell-nanoparticle interactions, and explores the different routes of NP entry into the organs causing toxicity. It provides further insights into understanding the key factors responsible for cardiovascular nanotoxicity, which mainly include carbon and metallic nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes, graphene oxide, iron, and other particles. Overall, this chapter contributes to the further understanding of the potential cardiovascular risks and mechanisms associated with NP-induced toxicity. © 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Snake venom 5'-nucleotidase (5'NUC) plays a very important role in envenomation strategies; however, apart from its modulation of hemostatic functions, its other pharmacological effects are not yet well characterized. Several studies have used specific inhibitors of enzyme toxins as a biochemical or pharmacological tool to characterize or establish its mechanism of action. We report here for the first time vanillin mandelic acid (VMA), an analog of vanillin, to potentially, selectively, and specifically inhibit venom 5'NUC activity among other enzymes present in venoms. VMA is much more potent in inhibiting 5'NUC activity than vanillyl acid (VA). The experimental results obtained are in good agreement with the in silico molecular docking interaction data. Both VA and VMA are competitive inhibitors as evident by the inhibition-relieving effect upon increasing the substrate concentration. VMA also dose-dependently inhibited the anticoagulant effect in Naja naja venom. In this study, we report novel non-nucleoside specific inhibitors of snake venom 5'NUC and experimentally demonstrate their involvement in the anticoagulant activity of N. naja venom. Hence, we hypothesize that VMA can be used as a molecular tool to evaluate the role of 5'NUC in snake envenomation and to develop prototypes and lead compounds with potential therapeutic applications against snake bites. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

abstract={The aim of the present study is to investigate the ameliorative potential of ethanolic extract of whole plant of Vernonia cinerea in the chronic constriction injury (CCI) of sciatic nerve induced neuropathic pain in rats. Behavioral parameters such as a hot plate, acetone drop, paw pressure, Von Frey hair and tail immersion tests were performed to assess the degree of thermal, chemical and mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia. Biochemical changes in sciatic nerve tissue were ruled out by estimating thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), reduced glutathione (GSH) and total calcium levels. Ethanolic extract of Vernonia cinerea and pregabalin were administered for 14 consecutive days starting from the day of surgery. CCI of sciatic nerve has been shown to induce significant changes in behavioral, biochemical and histopathological assessments when compared to the sham control group. Vernonia cinerea attenuated in a dose dependent manner the above pathological changes induced by CCI of the sciatic nerve, which is similar to attenuation of the pregabalin pretreated group. The ameliorating effect of ethanolic extract of Vernonia cinerea against CCI of sciatic nerve induced neuropathic pain may be due to the presence of flavonoids and this effect is attributed to anti-oxidative, neuroprotective and calcium channel modulator actions of these compounds. © 2014, Academia Brasileira de Ciencias.

abstract={Background: Thymoquinone (TQ) was shown to reduce tumor growth in several cancer models both in vitro and in vivo. So far only a few targets of TQ, including protein kinases have been identified. Considering that kinases are promising candidates for targeted anticancer therapy, we studied the complex kinase network regulated by TQ.Methods: Novel kinase targets influenced by TQ were revealed by in silico analysis of peptide array data obtained from TQ-treated HCT116wt cells. Western blotting and kinase activity assays were used to determine changes in kinase expression patterns in colorectal cancer cells (HCT116wt, DLD-1, HT29). To study the viability/apoptotic effects of combining the PAK1 inhibitor IPA-3 and TQ, crystal violet assay and AnnexinV/PI staining were employed. Interactions between PAK1 and ERK1/2 were investigated by co-immunoprecipitation and modeled by docking studies. Transfection with different PAK1 mutants unraveled the role of TQ-induced changes in PAK1 phosphorylation and TQ ´s effects on PAK1 scaffold function.Results: Of the 104 proteins identified, 50 were upregulated ≥2 fold by TQ and included molecules in the AKT-MEK-ERK1/2 pathway. Oncogenic PAK1 emerged as an interesting TQ target. Time-dependent changes in two PAK1 phosphorylation sites generated a specific kinase profile with early increase in pPAKThr212 followed by late increase in pPAKThr423. TQ induced an increase of pERK1/2 and triggered the early formation of an ERK1/2-PAK1 complex. Modeling confirmed that TQ binds in the vicinity of Thr212 accompanied by conformational changes in ERK2-PAK1 binding. Transfecting the cells with the non-phosphorylatable mutant T212A revealed an increase of pPAKThr423 and enhanced apoptosis. Likewise, an increase in apoptosis was observed in cells transfected with both the kinase-dead K299R mutant and PAK1 siRNA. Using structural modeling we suggest that TQ interferes also with the kinase domain consequently disturbing its interaction with pPAKThr423, finally inhibiting MEK-ERK1/2 signaling and disrupting its prosurvival function. pERK1/2 loss was also validated in vivo.Conclusions: Our study shows for the first time that the small molecule TQ directly binds to PAK1 changing its conformation and scaffold function. Because TQ affects the central RAF/MEK/ERK1/2 pathway, the combination of TQ with targeted therapies is worth considering for future anticancer treatments. © 2014 El-Baba et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={The study empirically examines the relationship between time to maturity and price volatility in NSE futures market by employing GARCH framework. It also investigates 'Mixture of Distribution Hypothesis' which is based on the relationship between futures price volatility and volume. For the analysis, data on daily closing pricing of Nifty Futures, volume and open interest are collected for the period from 4th July, 2003 to 28th, November, 2012. Besides, the study has chosen 10 individual stock futures and collected their daily closing price, volume and open interest data. The study uses near-month contract data as most trading activities have taken place in near-month contracts. The study considers open interest and volume as measures of futures trading activity. In the GARCH model for the NSE futures market the coefficient of the time-to-maturity variable is found to be insignificant, implying that time-to-maturity does not impact volatility in this market. Further the results strongly support 'Mixture of Distributions Hypothesis' in the NSE futures market. The study finally concludes that a future trading volume is a significant determinant of futures price volatility while time-to-maturity is not.},

abstract={Accumulating evidence indicates that wide range of polymer based nanoconjugated drug have the ability to overcome the microbial infection. The present study was to evaluate the effects of nanoconjugated chloroquine (Nch) against Plasmodium berghei NK65 (P. berghei) infection on selective makers of oxidative damage, antioxidant status, pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines in liver and spleen. P. berghei infected Swiss mice were treated with Nch (250 mg/kg bw for 15 days) compared with chloroquine. The stress markers, pro-inflammatory cytokines were increased significantly (P<0.05) and the anti-oxidant enzymes level, redox ratio (GSH/GSSG), anti-inflammatory markers were decreased significantly (P<0.05) in liver and spleen of infected mice compared with uninfected mice. Chloroquine and Nch effectively decreased the stress markers, pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as, increased antioxidants level in liver and spleen of the infected mice. Moreover, the favorable effect Nch is better than the chloroquine defending the tissue damage during malarial infection. These findings suggested that the potential use and prospective role of Nch than only chloroquine against P. berghei induced pathology as well as oxidative damage in liver and spleen. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

The bio-functionality of AgNPs has been successfully utilized for selective colorimetric sensing of potentially health and environmentally hazardous Hg2+, Cd2+ and Pb2+ metal ions at ppm level in aqueous solution. Importantly, clearly distinguishable colour for all three metal ions was observed. The influence of extract preparation condition and pH were also explored on the formation of AgNPs. Both selectivity and sensitivity differed for AgNPs synthesized from different parts of the plant. Direct correlation between the stability of green synthesized AgNPs at different pH and its antibacterial effects has been established.

abstract={The salubrious effects of 3-Formylchromone (3-FC) against nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA) mediated early hepatocellular carcinogenesis was investigated in vivo by this study. Male Wistar rats were administered three interspersed intraperitoneal injections of NDEA (200 mg/kg body weight) until sixth week, followed by, thrice a week oral dose of 3-FC (25 mg/kg body weight) from the seventh week to eleventh week. Oral supplementation of Wistar rats with 3-FC prevented the increase in serum marker enzymes (AST, ALT, LDH) and serum pre-neoplastic marker (γ-GT) induced by NDEA. Biochemical observations were found to be further correlated with histological studies, indicating the potential of 3-FC to mediate suppression of hepatic damage/pre-neoplastic lesions. Argyrophilic nucleolar organizer region (AgNOR) staining was done in histology sections to confirm the anti-proliferative potential of 3-FC against NDEA-induced early hepatocellular carcinogenesis. RT-PCR and immunoblot analysis was done to find the modulations in the gene transcript/protein level expression of pre-neoplastic marker (GST-pi), proliferation marker (PCNA), apoptotic mediators (PPARγ, NFκB-p65 and p53). 3-FC was found to favorably modulate the expressions of GST-pi, PCNA, PPARγ, NFκB-p65, p53 clearly confirming the anti-proliferative and apoptotic potential of 3-FC. Further, the apoptotic effect of 3-FC against NDEA-induced early hepatocellular carcinogenesis was confirmed by caspase-3 activity assay and DNA fragmentation analysis. Based on these findings, it is concluded that 3-FC possesses hepatoprotective, anti-pre-neoplastic, anti-proliferative and apoptosis inducing capability against NDEA-induced early hepatocellular carcinogenesis. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract={In this study, results of GPR profiling related to mapping of subsurface sedimentary layers at tsunami affected Karaikal beach are presented. A 400 MHz antenna was used for profiling along 262 m stretch of transect from beach to backshore areas with penetration of about 2.0 m depth (50 ns two-way travel time). The velocity analysis was carried out to estimate the depth information along the GPR profile. Based on the significant changes in the reflection amplitude, three different zones are marked and the upper zone is noticed with less moisture compared to other two (saturated) zones. The water table is noticed to vary from 0.5 to 0.75 m depth (12–15 ns) as moving away from the coastline. Buried erosional surface is observed at 1.5 m depth (40–42 ns), which represents the limit up to which the extreme event acted upon. In other words, it is the depth to which the tsunami sediments have been piled up to about 1.5 m thickness. Three field test pits were made along the transect and sedimentary sequences were recorded. The sand layers, especially, heavy mineral layers, recorded in the test pits indicate a positive correlation with the amplitude and velocity changes in the GPR profile. Such interpretation seems to be difficult in the middle zone due to its water saturation condition. But it is fairly clear in the lower zone located just below the erosional surface where the strata is comparatively more compact. The inferences from the GPR profile thus provide a lucid insight to the subsurface sediment sequences of the tsunami sediments in the Karaikal beach. © Indian Academy of Sciences.},

Our results demonstrated good cell uptake in a time-dependent manner and nanoparticles were found to localize in the cytosol. Further, the nanoparticles exhibited excellent negative contrast in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) experiments and with no cytoxicity (5-100 g/mL iron oxide nanoparticles) to both normal as well as cancer cells demonstrating its biocompatibility.

abstract={We have herein computationally examined binding affinities and specificity of 2-hydroxy-3,5-dinitrobenzamide (HDNB), a small chemical molecular BH3-mimetic identified by means of 'peptidodynmimetic method', on the BH3-binding grooves of six anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-B, Bcl-W, Bcl-XL, Bfl-1 and Mcl-1) from human beings. The HDNB ligand was found to interact on the BH3-binding grooves of Bcl-2, Bcl-B, Bcl-XL, Bfl-1 and Mcl-1, whereas it did not act as BH3-mimetic to Bcl-W. Moreover, binding affinities of the HDNB towards the anti-apoptotic proteins were significantly different from each other. The differential binding affinities and specificity of the HDNB towards the anti-apoptotic proteins have been chiefly attributed to the differences in the chemical properties of BH3-binding grooves of the proteins. Implications of the study to design efficient de novo antagonists to the anti-apoptotic proteins using the HDNB as seed molecule have been discussed.},

We report that some porous polymer/ceramic composite scaffolds possess intrinsic osteoinductivity as shown through their capacity to induce in vivo host osteoid mineralization and in vitro stem cell osteogenesis making them attractive synthetic bone graft substitutes. It was discovered that certain low crystallinity ceramics partially dissociate into simple signaling molecules (i.e., calcium and phosphate ions) that induce stem cells to endogenously produce their own osteoinductive proteins. Review of the literature has uncovered a variety of simple signaling molecules (i.e., gases, ions, and redox reagents) capable of inducing other desirable stem cell differentiation through endogenous growth factor production. Inductive simple signaling molecules, which we have termed inducerons, represent a paradigm shift in the field of regenerative engineering where they can be utilized in place of recombinant protein growth factors. © 2014 Cushnie et al.},

abstract={SummaryBackground The kinetochore is a multiprotein machine that couples chromosome movement to microtubule (MT) polymerization and depolymerization. It uses numerous copies of at least three MT-binding proteins to generate bidirectional movement. The nanoscale organization of these proteins within the kinetochore plays an important role in shaping the mechanisms that drive persistent, bidirectional movement of the kinetochore. Results We used fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between genetically encoded fluorescent proteins fused to kinetochore subunits to reconstruct the nanoscale organization of the budding yeast kinetochore. We performed >60 FRET and high-resolution colocalization measurements involving the essential MT-binding kinetochore components: Ndc80, Dam1, Spc105, and Stu2. These measurements reveal that neighboring Ndc80 complexes within the kinetochore are narrowly distributed along the length of the MT. Dam1 complex molecules are concentrated near the MT-binding domains of Ndc80. Stu2 localizes in high abundance within a narrowly defined territory within the kinetochore centered ∼20 nm on the centromeric side of the Dam1 complex. Conclusions Our data show that the MT attachment site of the budding yeast kinetochore is well organized. Ndc80, Dam1, and Stu2 are all narrowly distributed about their average positions along the kinetochore-MT axis. The relative organization of these components, their narrow distributions, and their known MT-binding properties together elucidate how their combined actions generate persistent, bidirectional kinetochore movement coupled to MT polymerization and depolymerization. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Their reduction with sodium triacetoxyborohydride furnished piperidine derivatives bearing up to five substituents with full diastereoselectivity in a hitherto inaccessible stereochemical arrangement. The reaction proceeded with no significant loss of enantiomeric purity under mild reduction conditions that are compatible with several functional groups that are normally sensitive to reduction. Octahydroquinolin-5-one derivatives, which were prepared by a modified version of the initial multicomponent reaction, were not suitable substrates for the sodium triacetoxyborohydride mediated reduction, but they were transformed into the corresponding decahydroquinolines, including a precursor of the amphibian alkaloid pumiliotoxin C, by catalytic hydrogenation under a variety of conditions. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

abstract={Polymeric nanoparticles like chitosan nanoparticles may be used to deliver drugs to particular organs, such as heart. However, due to the lack of information about acute effects of chitosan nanoparticles in cardiac calcium handling, we evaluated the same in intact rat left ventricular myocytes. Chitosan nanoparticles were synthesized by ionic gelation method for three different concentrations of chitosan and tripolyphosphate (TPP) such as 1:1, 2:1 and 3:1, respectively. The size of the particles was below 100 nm for the 2:1 and 3:1 chitosan:TPP ratio and 300 nm for 1:1 ratio. The particles synthesized in 3:1 ratio were incubated for 0, 15, 30 and 60 minutes with Fluo-3 loaded cardiomyocytes, their effects were evaluated in local Ca2+ release events using confocal microscopy and compared with control cells. Chitosan nanoparticles increased the amplitude and size of Ca2+ spark by 14.1% and 24.1% at 30 minutes of incubation; while the increment was 24.7% and 28.4% at 60 minutes respectively. Accordingly, rising time of Ca2+ sparks was decreased by 47% at 30 minutes. These changes were reflected in increased local Ca2+ flux by 58.3% and spark-mediated Ca2+ leak by 145.9% and 146.5% at 30, and 60 minutes, respectively. Hence, these results indicate that chitosan nanoparticles modify the properties of local Ca 2+ release events mainly at short incubation times and must be taken into account while using these nanoparticles in drug delivery. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Motile bacteria adapt themselves to changes in chemical environment by a stochastic mechanism called chemotaxis, which plays a major role in many bacterial processes. We report here for the first time that the preferential migration of bacteria across a nutrient gradient can be harnessed to generate useful electric power. The chemotactic battery demonstrated in the present work involves a nutrient-localized anode toward which bacteria activated by starvation migrate and generate electricity by oxidation of the nutrient molecules. The chemotactic battery yields a significant power density (25±2Wm-2). Systematic investigation on biofilm morphology and electroactivity reveals significant differences between chemotactic and non-chemotactic configurations. In addition, the chemotactic setup has also been integrated in the anode chamber of a microbial fuel cell to improve microbial biofilm properties. Thus the results of the study could be used to design miniature microbial batteries for portable applications as well as to improve the performance of microbial fuel cells. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

abstract={The normal physiological concentration of carbonic acid in human blood is in the range of 1.08-1.32mM. However, if the concentration of carbonic acid rises above 3.45mM, it may lead to respiratory acidosis. In this context, an electrochemical biosensor with CeO 2 -PANI (polyaniline) core-shell nano-interface was developed for sensing carbonic acid using carbonic anhydrase (CA). CA was immobilized on CeO 2 -PANI via chitosan on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE/CeO 2 -PANI/CA/chitosan). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns confirmed the polycrystalline nature of CeO 2 and CeO 2 -PANI nanoparticles. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) studies showed the aggregation of spherical nanoparticles with size ranging from 37.6 to 47.8nm and Field emission transmission electron microscopy (FE-TEM) study confirmed the presence of core-shell structure of CeO 2 -PANI. Immobilization of CA on CeO 2 -PANI was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra. Electrochemical studies were carried out with the help of GCE/CeO 2 -PANI/CA as a working electrode, Ag/AgCl saturated with 0.1M KCl as a reference electrode and Pt wire as a counter electrode. This biosensor exhibited sensitivity of 696.49μAcm -2 mM -1 with a linear range of 1.32-2.32mM. It also showed a fast response time of less than 1s, lowest detection limit of 19.4μM, Michaelis-Menten constant (K M ) of 1.8191mM and dry stability of 96% up to 18days. The observed results revealed the potential of the modified working electrode with CeO 2 -PANI core-shell nano-interface for carbonic acid sensing. The developed biosensor can be applied for the real time clinical diagnosis of diseases such as obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD). © 2014 Published by Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={At present, the majority of established treatments for breast cancer are based on clinical manifestations, some fundamental of molecular and cellular biology of cancer. In recent times, the therapy is moving towards personalized medicines. Nevertheless, both the methodologies have own demerits. In the present study, we proposed a novel idea of targeted therapy with twin pharmacological potential by a peptide pACC1. The peptide was formulated with chitosan and evaluated with DMBA induced mammary carcinoma. Results suggest that the peptide holds great control on tumor cell multiplication, fatty acid synthesis and lactate levels. In addition, peptide also brings normal metabolic signs in glycolytic and glycogenic pathways. Histological studies confirm the dual pharmacological actions. Further, it is also proven that the peptide controls membrane receptor levels of HER2 and EGFR. In conclusion, that the peptide pACC1 could be employed as greater therapeutic adjuvant with currently established drugs without considering the stage of the cancer. © 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

NATA undergoes a major sharp endothermic transition with the melting point of the hydrated samples occurs considerably at lower temperature compared to the dry samples. Thermodynamic parameters, transition enthalpy (ΔHt) and transition entropy (ΔSt), associated with the chain-melting phase transitions depends linearly on the number of carbon atoms. The contributions of each methylene unit to the transition enthalpy and entropy and the end contributions arising from the head group and the terminal group was determined and reported. These results are very important to understand the thermodynamics basis of NATA phase properties in other membrane lipids. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The dynamics of HIV-1 protease (HIV-pr), a drug target for HIV infection, has been studied extensively by both computational and experimental methods. The flap dynamics of HIV-pr is considered to be more important for better ligand binding and enzymatic actions. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the drug-induced mutations can change the flap dynamics of HIV-pr affecting the binding affinity of the ligands. Therefore, detailed understanding of flap dynamics is essential for designing better inhibitors. Previous computational investigations observed significant variation in the flap opening in nanosecond time scale indicating that the dynamics is highly sensitive to the simulation protocols. To understand the sensitivity of the flap dynamics on the force field and simulation protocol, molecular dynamics simulations of HIV-pr have been performed with two different AMBER force fields, ff99 and ff02. Two different trajectories (20 ns each) were obtained using the ff99 and ff02 force field. The results showed polarizable force field (ff02) make the flap tighter than the nonpolarizable force field (ff99). Some polar interactions and hydrogen bonds involving flap residues were found to be stronger with ff02 force field. The formation of interchain hydrophobic cluster (between flap tip of one chain and active site wall of another chain) was found to be dominant in the semi-open structures obtained from the simulations irrespective of the force field. It is proposed that an inhibitor, which will promote this interchain hydrophobic clustering, may make the flaps more rigid, and presumably the effect of mutation would be small on ligand binding. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={C5-unsubstituted-C6-aryl-1,4-dihydropyridines were prepared by a CAN-catalyzed multicomponent reaction from chalcones, β-dicarbonyl compounds, and ammonium acetate. These compounds were able to block Ca2+ entry after a depolarizing stimulus and showed an improved Cav1.3/Cav1.2 selectivity in comparison with nifedipine. Furthermore, they were able to protect neuroblastoma cells against Ca 2+ overload and oxidative stress models. Their selectivity ratio makes them highly interesting for the treatment of neurological disorders where Ca2+ dyshomeostasis and high levels of oxidative stress have been demonstrated. Furthermore, their low potency toward the cardiovascular channel subtype makes them safer by reducing their probable side effects, in comparison to classical 1,4-dihydropyridines. Some compounds afforded good protective profile in a postincubation model that simulates the real clinical situation of ictus patients, offering a therapeutic window of opportunity of great interest for patient recovery after a brain ischemic episode. Good activities were also found in acute ischemia/reperfusion models of oxygen and glucose deprivation. © 2014 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Topoisomerase 1 inhibition is an important strategy in targeted cancer chemotherapy. The drugs currently in use acting on this enzyme belong to the family of the camptothecins, and suffer severe limitations because of their low stability, which is associated with the hydrolysis of the d-lactone moiety in their E ring. Luotonin A is a natural camptothecin analogue that lacks this functional group and therefore shows a much-improved stability, but at the cost of a lower activity. Therefore, the development of luotonin A analogues with an increased potency is important for progress in this area. In the present paper, a small library of luotonin A analogues modified at their A and B rings was generated by cerium(IV) ammonium nitratecatalyzed Friedländer reactions. All analogues showed an activity similar or higher than the natural luotonin A in terms of topoisomerase 1 inhibition and some compounds had an activity comparable to that of camptothecin. Furthermore, most compounds showed a better activity than luotonin A in cell cytotoxicity assays. In order to rationalize these results, the first docking studies of luotonin-topoisomerase 1-DNA ternary complexes were undertaken. Most compounds bound in a manner similar to luotonin A and to standard topoisomerase poisons such as topotecan but, interestingly, the two most promising analogues, bearing a 3,5-dimethylphenyl substituent at ring B, docked in a different orientation. This binding mode allows the hydrophobic moiety to be shielded from the aqueous environment by being buried between the deoxyribose belonging to the G(+1) guanine and Arg364 in the scissile strand and the surface of the protein and a hydrogen bond between the D-ring carbonyl and the basic amino acid. The discovery of this new binding mode and its associated higher inhibitory potency is a significant advance in the design of new topoisomerase 1 inhibitors. © 2014 González-Ruiz et al.},

abstract={This study from South India was performed to ascertain the impact of seven functional polymorphisms of one-carbon metabolic pathway on total plasma homocysteine levels and susceptibility to PD. A total of 151 cases of Parkinson's disease and 416 healthy controls were analyzed for fasting plasma homocysteine levels by reverse phase HPLC. PCR-RFLP approaches were used to analyze glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII) 1561 C>T, reduced folate carrier 1 (RFC1) 80 G>A, cytosolic serine hydroxymethyl transferase (cSHMT) 1420 C>T, methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677 C>T, methionine synthase (MTR) 2756 A>G and methionine synthase reductase (MTRR) 66 A>G polymorphisms. PCR-AFLP was used for the analysis of thymidylate synthase (TYMS) 5'-UTR 28. bp tandem repeat. PD cases exhibited elevated plasma homocysteine levels compared to controls (men: 28.8 ± 6.9 vs. 16.4 ± 8.8. μmol/L; women: 25.4 ± 5.3 vs. 11.2 ± 5.1. μmol/L). Homocysteine levels showed positive correlation with male gender (r= 0.39, p<. 0.0001) and MTRR 66 A>G (r= 0.31, p<. 0.0001) whereas an inverse correlation was observed with cSHMT 1420 C>T polymorphism. MTRR 66 A>G polymorphism showed independent risk for PD (OR: 3.42, 95% CI: 2.35-4.98) whereas cSHMT 1420 C>T conferred protection against PD (OR: 0.11, 95% CI: 0.07-0.17). Multifactor dimensionality reduction analysis showed synergistic interactions between MTHFR 677 C>T and MTRR 66 A>G, whereas cSHMT 1420 C>T exhibited counteracting interactions in altering susceptibility to PD. To conclude, PD cases exhibited hyperhomocysteinemia and MTRR 66 A>G and cSHMT 1420 C>T gene variants were shown to modulate PD risk by altering the homocysteine levels. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

Levels of medium variables, namely carbon to nitrogen ratio (C/N), pH, NaCl concentration and ZnSO4·5H2O concentration were optimized to maximize pullulan production using Box-Behnken design of experiments. Optimal values were predicted as: C/N ratio - 28.1, pH - 6.6, NaCl - 0.78g/l and ZnSO4·5H2O - 0.37g/l. Theoretical pullulan yield predicted under optimum condition was 30.4mg/gds. Pullulan was produced under optimum condition and an experimental yield of 28.7±0.3mg/gds was obtained. 13C NMR spectra of the exopolysaccharide produced from Asian palm kernel revealed the presence of anomeric α (1→6) linked maltosyl units. The weight-average molecular weight of the polymer was determined to be 8.4×106Da by gel permeation chromatography. Thermal decomposition temperature of pullulan was obtained to be 245°C.

abstract={In this paper, a facile in situ method is reported for the preparation of catalytic silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using N-acyl tyramine (NATA) with variable hydrophobic acyl length. Scanning electron microscopic analysis shows that NATA exists initially as larger aggregates in alkaline aqueous solution. The addition of AgNO3 dissociates these larger aggregate and subsequently promotes the formation of self-assembled NATA and AgNPs. Characterization of AgNPs using UV-vis spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope revealed that the hydrophobic acyl chain length of NATA does not influence the particle size, shape and morphology. All NATA-AgNPs yielded relatively identical values in full width at half-maximum (FWHM) analysis, indicating that the AgNPs prepared with NATA are relatively polydispersed at all tested acyl chain lengths. These nanoparticles are able to efficiently catalyze the reduction of 4-nitro phenol to 4-amino phenol, 2-nitro aniline to 1,2-diamino benzene, 2,4,6-trinitro phenol to 2,4,6-triamino phenol by NaBH4 in an aqueous environment. The reduction reaction rate is determined to be pseudo-first order and the apparent rate constant is linearly dependent on the hydrophobic acyl chain length of the NATA. All reaction kinetics presented an induction period, which is dependent on the N-acyl chain length, indicating that the hydrophobic effects play a critical role in bringing the substrate to the metal nanoparticle surface to induce the catalytic reaction. In this study, however, the five catalytic systems have similar size and polydispersity, differing only in terms of capping agent hydrophobicity, and shows different catalytic activity with respect to the alkyl chain length of the capping agent. As discussed, the ability to modulate the metal nanoparticles catalytic property, by modifying the capping agent hydrophobicity represents a promising future for developing an efficient nanocatalyst without altering the size, shape and morphology of the nanoparticles. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Stable sand-propylene glycol nanofluids were formulated by dispersing sand nanoparticles (20-25. nm) produced by stirred bead milling, in propylene glycol through extended probe ultrasonication. The viscosity of sand-propylene nanofluids decreases with nanoparticle concentration (0-2. vol%) and temperature (29-140. °C). In the well-dispersed nano-sand-propylene glycol dispersion, interactions between nanoparticles and propylene glycol through nanoparticles' surface led to disturbance of hydrogen bonding network of propylene glycol. This is manifested as reduction in viscosity of dispersion in comparison to pure propylene glycol. For instance, the viscosity of 2. vol% nanofluid was found to be 46% lower than that of pure propylene glycol at 29. °C. The study of influence of nanoparticle concentration and temperature (10-50. °C) on thermal conductivity reveals linear increase of thermal conductivity with nanoparticle concentration. Higher thermal conductivity enhancement at lower temperatures (46.2% for 2. vol% nanofluid at 10. °C) reveals the role of ordered liquid layers toward thermal conductivity enhancement in well-dispersed nano-sand-propylene glycol dispersion. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={A novel and facile synthetic approach has been trialed, and attempted with success in the preparation of two phosphors namely, a red emitting CaSrSiO 4:Eu3+ and a green emitting CaSrSiO4:Eu 2+. These phosphors were successfully synthesized using a simple co-precipitating solvo-thermal strategy wherein tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) as silica source and the acetate precursors of strontium (Sr2+), calcium (Ca2+) and europium (Eu3+) are utilized. The material so obtained is subjected to an extensive photoluminescence behavior study. The concentration of the dopant (Eu3+and Eu2+) plays a significant role in the determination of photoluminescence behavior and hence a systematic and in-depth experimental studies were done and the results are synchronized. On interpretation of the output, it came to light that an intense emission signals sparked in the red region (590 and 615 nm) in the case of phosphor doped with Eu3+, which is excited under near ultra violet (395 nm) and blue (466 nm) region. In case of the CaSrSiO4 sample doped with Eu2+ , an intense broad green signal (∼510 nm) is obtained under the excitation range of 350-430 nm. The results obtained are quite encouraging and made a strong confirmation as, the solvo-thermally synthesized CaSrSiO4, which is activated by the dopants namely Eu3+ and Eu2+ possesses an immense potential and it is exactly tapped by the adopted methodology. Despite its strong impact, it will also assure a strong revolution in the fabrication and thus the commercialization of white LEDs as both the red and green emitting phosphor. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.},

abstract={Fluorine doped ZnO nanopowders were synthesized from starting solutions having different doping levels of F (0, 5,., 20 at.%) using a simple soft chemical route and the effects of the doping level on the structural, optical, surface morphological and antibacterial properties were investigated. The XRD studies reveal that all the products have preferential orientation along the (1 0 1) plane. The PL studies show that all the samples exhibit strong visible emission with a peak at 425 nm. The enhancement in the visible emission indicates an increasing number of surface defects caused by the doping of F. The obtained FTIR spectra confirm the incorporation of F into ZnO lattice. From the SEM studies, it is observed that the ZnO nanowires formed at 10 at.% of F doping level exhibit excellent antibacterial activities. Antibacterial activity of F doped ZnO nanopowders against Staphylococcus aureus was found to be significantly higher than that against the Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa micro-organisms. All the physical properties were corroborated well with the findings related to antibacterial activity. Finally, we conclude that, the analysis of all the results shows that F doping level of 10 at.% is optimal in all respects and is suitable for antibacterial applications. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The study covers two periods: pre-crisis (from March 01, 2005 to January, 30 2008) and post-crisis (from February 01, 2008 to December 30, 2012). To demonstrate the influence of crisis on stock returns volatility, a dummy variable was introduced in the GJR GARCH model. It is found that the volatility of mean returns had increased during the post crisis period as compared to the pre-crisis period.

The increase in polymer coverage density enhances the size of the aggregate as the van der Waals force of attraction dominates with the increase in the number of thiol chains. The change in the terminal group from methyl (hydrophobic) to hydroxy (hydrophilic) group modifies the size of the aggregate as the extent of interdigitation between thiol chains is reduced due to the hydrogen bond interactions between the hydroxy terminal groups. The water solvent does not much alter the aggregation of methyl terminated gold nanoparticles. It weakens the aggregation of hydroxy terminated gold nanoparticles due to the hydrophilic interaction between the water molecules and the hydroxy terminal groups. © 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Studies of replicative and chronological lifespan in Saccharomyces cerevisiae have advanced understanding of longevity in all eukaryotes. Chronological lifespan in this species is defined as the agedependent viability of nondividing cells. To date this parameter has only been estimated under calorie restriction, mimicked by starvation. Because postmitotic cells in higher eukaryotes often do not starve, we developed a model yeast system to study cells as they age in the absence of calorie restriction. Yeast cells were encapsulated in a matrix consisting of calcium alginate to form ~3 mm beads that were packed into bioreactors and fed ad libitum. Under these conditions cells ceased to divide, became heat shock and zymolyase resistant, yet retained high fermentative capacity. Over the course of 17 d, immobilized yeast cells maintained <95% viability, whereas the viability of starving, freely suspended (planktonic) cells decreased to >10%. Immobilized cells exhibited a stable pattern of gene expression that differed markedly from growing or starving planktonic cells, highly expressing genes in glycolysis, cell wall remodeling, and stress resistance, but decreasing transcription of genes in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and genes that regulate the cell cycle, including master cyclins CDC28 and CLN1. Stress resistance transcription factor MSN4 and its upstream effector RIM15 are conspicuously up-regulated in the immobilized state, and an immobilized rim15 knockout strain fails to exhibit the long-lived, growth-Arrested phenotype, suggesting that altered regulation of the Rim15-mediated nutrient-sensing pathway plays an important role in extending yeast chronological lifespan under calorie-unrestricted conditions.},

abstract={Polymeric nanofibrous scaffolds have the potential to interact and regulate specific regenerative events at molecular level to restore the damaged tissues. Nanofibers can be fabricated using various techniques like electrospinning, phase separation, self-assembly, etc. Electrospinning is the most widely employed method to fabricate nanofibers for applications in tissue engineering. The electrospun ultrafine fibers can be tuned to exhibit desired pore distribution, high surface area-to-volume ratio, cell adhesion and proliferation due to their structural resemblance to the native extracellular matrix. Electrospun polymeric nanofibers possess various advantages as skin substitutes because they can prevent fluid and proteins loss from the wound area, help in the removal of exudates, inhibit microbial infection, exhibit excellent anti-adhesion properties and guide endogenous cells to proliferate and remodel. Nanofibrous scaffolds are currently being fabricated in combination with growth factors and / or cells to accelerate orchestrated wound healing. The use of electrospun nanofibrous scaffolds for skin tissue engineering is detailed in this review. Further, recent advances in fabricating biocomposite nanofibrous scaffolds, electrospinning-coupled electrospraying of cells and stem cells for skin tissue engineering are also highlighted. © 2014 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={An Ultrasonic under-sodium scanner has been developed for use in Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR), Kalpakkam, India. We have devised a scanning technique to determine the in-situ 'bow', if any, of the fuel sub-assembly(FSA) in the reactor by any one of the three methods viz 'circle-fitting', 'geometrical' and 'Hough transform-based'. In this paper, we propose a computer simulation of the ultrasonic pulse-echo measurement technique adopted in an earlier under-water experiment to determine the distances of a mock-up FSA head located at distances of 135 to 161 mm from the scanner axis, simulating the 'bow' up to 26mm. The simulation includes an acoustic model using Huygens approach to calculate the amplitudes of the ultrasonic echoes received by two downward viewing transducers (DVTs), while they scan over a simulated FSA top surface. We estimate the distances by the latter two of the above methods to an accuracy of ±2mm. These values, which are more accurate than the experimental values, are obtained after selecting for the simulation study a larger scale value for the distance to number of image pixels and a lower value for the incremental scanning angle (than those of the experiment), and by processing of 'direct-surface' echoes. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={The origin of Noyyal River is the Vellingiri hills which is located in the Coimbatore district, Tamil Nadu, India. The townships of Coimbatore, Tirupur and Erode were surrounded by the Noyyal River, its canals, tanks, and rivulets. Mainly, Tirupur area is facing plights due to the huge concentration of industrial wastes discharged by the cloth dyeing industries. This river has 23 check dams and most of them are situated around Kooduthurai and Tirupur. Tirupur area has surrounded by many numbers of dyeing and textile units in the upstream. These units are ejected their effluents into the river which contains lot of chemical and toxic substances. Based on the recent water quality analysis the irrigation wells along the river and in the downstream villages have been contaminated and the ecosystem has been harmfully affected by the seepage and percolation of water stored in the Orathapalayam dam. Ultimately it also create problems to the agriculture, livestock and rearing. Hence the treatment is major concerned before discharging the effluents. For the treatment process, it is necessary to carry out various parameter analyses which determine the quality of water. This article deals with various parametric analyses such as pH, total dissolved solids, calcium, magnesium, nitrates, nitrites, BOD, COD, DO, heavy metals and the effects of various pollutants involved in Noyyal River basin. © 2014, Sphinx Knowledge House.

abstract={Experiments were carried out on the influence of nanoparticle-liquid interactions on transport properties (viscosity and thermal conductivity) of ZnO-Propylene glycol-water nanofluids. Our experiments show that the preparation of ZnO-Propylene glycol-water nanofluid through addition of water to well-dispersed ZnO-Propylene glycol dispersion results in decreased viscosity and increased thermal conductivity, in comparison to that of propylene glycol-water mixture, due to favourable nanoparticle-liquid interaction. Such nanofluids are stable even without addition of any stabilizing agent. The study of influence of nanoparticle concentration (≤2 vol%) and temperature (15-50 C) on thermal conductivity reveal higher thermal conductivity enhancements at lower temperatures. This could be attributed to layering of propylene glycol molecules on surface of ZnO nanoparticles.

The overall decision is made by using the weighted cooperative rule at the base station of the CR network. This method improves the performance of the spectrum sensing by reducing the bandwidth constraints and the transmission power. The proposed method results in the considerable progress in the detection probability compared to the Eigen value based spectrum sensing and that of using Multitaper method (MTM) only. The weighted cooperative rules gives the best performances compared to the only OR rule because the weighted cooperative rule assigns the weight to the secondary users according to the SNR. The numbers of singular values used in this method are equal to or less than 4 when the obtained singular values are 8.The proposed technique is examined and the simulation results are obtained using the MATLAB. © Research India Publications.},

During clock cycles, debug data can be captured where errors exist in this tactic. By the use of two modules, the proposed work is executed. One of the module is trace buffer and the other is workstation module. Both the modules are compared to attain the exact number of erroneous data and its location.

abstract={Hepatitis a killer of liver cells causes severe liver inflammation. It avoids liver from healthy and active functioning. Hence timely pronouncement of hepatitis is much needed. Soft computing systems which behave as human mind include components like neural networks, fuzzy logic, machine learning, and evolutionary technique. Hence soft computing methods offer wide applications to handle the medical data with high cognitive skills and assist medical specialists in time of uncertainty. In this paper a design of soft computing system to investigate hepatitis using rough set reducts classified by feed forward neural networks (FFNN) is proposed. The missing values in the attribute set are removed before feature reduction and the reduct groups (RG) are formed through rough set with minimal number of attributes. The reduct group formed is used in training, testing, and validation. The performance is evaluated by confusion matrix (CM) and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC). Parameters like sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and coverage are calculated from the above performance measures. With data completeness a reduct group of four to two attributes achieves 93.75% to 97.5% of accuracy. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={A Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) consists of redundant sensor nodes which transmit wirelessly and can be operated with limited power supply.

Large number of nodes can be distributed over a wide area. Sensor nodes have the potential to detect an event, measurement of environmental conditions and it also provides detailed information about the measured data. Energy constraint is an important issue because replacement of batteries would not occur very often. Power is consumed enormously during transmission of data. In this paper, sensor network lifetime is evaluated by comparing with both Clustering and Virtual Backbone Scheduling (VBS) approach. Clustering is employed to minimize the number of nodes taking part in transmission to achieve the energy savings. Backbone nodes only forward the data and remaining sensor nodes are in sleep mode so that it sustains the network lifetime. The Network Simulator (NS)-2 is used to analyze the system lifetime model.

abstract={In this manuscript, MnCO3 is introduced as a novel electrode material for supercapacitors. MnCO3 was synthesized by a hydrothermal method using KMnO4 and commercial sugar as precursors. The synthesized product was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, SEM, TEM and Raman spectroscopic studies. Rietveld refinement of powder X-ray diffraction confirmed the formation of a pure phase of MnCO3. Microscopic studies revealed particles of different shapes with sizes varying from 0.1 to 0.3 μm. Elemental mapping demonstrated a uniform distribution of manganese, carbon, and oxygen and there are no other impurity elements observed. The capacitive storage performance of MnCO3 was evaluated in three different electrolytes, namely, 0.1 M Na2SO4, 0.1 M Mg(ClO4)2 and 6 M KOH by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling. A high specific capacitance of 216 F g-1 was obtained at a high loading level of 1.5 mg cm-2 for submicron sized particles of MnCO3 in a 0.1 M Mg(ClO 4)2 electrolyte. Good reversibility, high coulombic efficiency, respectable rate performance and long cycle-life are also reported for MnCO3. This study opens up ample avenues to explore a new class of carbonate based materials for supercapacitor applications. © 2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={Vehicular ad hoc network is an ad hoc network constituted among moving vehicles that have wireless dedicated short range communication (DSRC) devices in order to provide ubiquitous connectivity even if the road-side infrastructure is unavailable. Message dissemination in vehicular ad hoc networks is necessary for exchanging information about prevailing traffic information, so that the vehicles can take alternate routes to avoid traffic jam. A major challenge in broadcast protocols is that they result in flooding of messages that reduce the speed of dissemination due to collision. Dissemination of messages using tree topology reduces the number of rebroadcasts. Dynamicity Aware Graph Relabeling System model provides a framework to construct spanning tree in mobile wireless network. In this paper, we propose a new distributed algorithm for constructing an arbitrary spanning tree based on Dynamicity Aware Graph Relabeling System model, which develops a maximum leaf spanning tree in order to reduce the number of rebroadcasts and dissemination time. Our simulation results prove that the number of vehicles rebroadcasting the message is curtailed to 15% and the dissemination time required to achieve 100% reachability is curtailed by 10% under average vehicle density. © 2014 S.

abstract={The technique of finding the indoor geography system is little complex and problem for facing the researchers. Inspite the system performance will depend mainly on the characteristics of wireless channel and also used by positioning algorithm for training the point due to some statistical variations. In indoor wireless localization, we use location metrics of RSSI for calculating the performance analysis of the UWB channel. It is also promoted for twodimensional and the estimated locations are filtered for error reduction. The RSSI measurement is carried out with respect to Access Point (AP).While compared to other metrics like TOA and AOA, RSS shows the better performance for analyzing the error and also relationship between the metrics and the error is ambiguous. Further, free space path loss (FSPL) model is also calculated by using distance Vs path loss and to calculate the mean square error (MSE) in simulation. The simulation results demonstrate the algorithm is of great advantage for improving the localization accuracy and wide range of application. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={E-commerce is an easy shopping method among all the internet users due to rapid development in internet and World Wide Web. Nowadays selling or business activities are all adopting e-commerce system. Purchasing over internet brings more ease for both consumers and vendors. The most concerning factor by consumers are security and protecting private information with e-cash payment. Traditional methods uses physical money exchange, communication with banking network, revealing account information and unsecured transaction. Hacking details of customer bank account can be easily done. This paper proposes an agent based anonymity and software technology implementing an e-wallet to accommodate digital coins on mobile devices. Digital coin is virtual money and works just like the conventional physical cash exchange system. Anonymity of the user maintained by trusted third party considered to be an agent. This technology is created as a mobile application to generate the e-coins which is stored in an ewallet and then used for e-purchase. This initiates an infrastructure less protocol, offline payment scheme, secured transaction, not account based and peer-to-peer e-cash transfer similar to physical cash transfer.

abstract={As the demand of portable consumer electronic products increases rapidly and the chip size decreases, designers are facing many challenges towards the circuit area and power. Decades ago, engineers worried about the speed of operation of the system. They are able to manage this challenge by reducing the length of the transistors. But still, low power sub-system circuit designs are the toughest job by the engineers. Since the battery technology does not grow rapidly, still people are forced to use such a large size batteries in the system to operate. Engineers are not concentrating much about the size reduction of batteries because of huge risk factors like highly explosive. The only choice with the designers to produce a system which will consume low power is the best design with the circuit. Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) logic styles are much popular for dissipating less energy or low power. Here we present 8-bit comparator logic circuits with different logic styles like conventional CMOS, Dynamic CMOS and Domino CMOS. Initially, single-bit comparator is designed and the functionality is verified with all kind of styles. Using this design, by connecting them in a cascaded manner 4-bit comparator and 8-bit comparator are designed. Comparator logic circuits are very important data path module in a processor based systems for the comparison of two words. We simulate all the designs using DSCH (Digital Schematic) and Microwind Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools with the functional verification of Greater Than (GT), Less Than (LT) and Equal (EQ) among the two words.

abstract={The importance of adder sub-systems are well known by every designers and engineers. Hence the engineers are still doing research with them by incorporating novel design techniques to speed up the circuit along with power reduction. Adder logic-cells are used in many applications like within a microprocessors, digital signal processors, etc., especially where the digital data is being processed. A Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) design techniques are implemented here with different logic styles. We implement some novel design ideas which will have less number of transistors along with variable length and width of the transistors to implement the addition. Reduction of clock frequency, supply voltage and the load capacitance are the pertinent techniques to reduce the dynamic power dissipation. Methods like clock gating, transistors with high thresholds, increasing the length of the transistors are few techniques to reduce the static power dissipation. We simulate our adder logic-cell designs using DSCH (Digital Schematic) Computer Aided Design (CAD) tool. A Microwind which is a Layout Editor tool is used to acquire better results of power dissipation and they are compared along with the conventional CMOS logic, Pass-transistor logic, Transmission-gate logic styles. We conclude pass-transistor logic based results are better as compared to the other designs. All simulation results are made using 90 nm foundry technology libraries using Microwind software tool. Our work will be further extended by designing novel XOR/XNOR circuits for the improvement of power reduction of the adder logic-cells. © 2014 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

In this context, microbial fuel cells with a solid electrolyte sandwiched between a cathode and anode would be an attractive configuration. In this work, we report the synthesis and characterization of highly cross-linked multi-walled carbon nanotube/polyacrylamide composite hydrogels as solid electrolyte for application in such devices. The composite hydrogels were synthesized by in situ free radical polymerization of acrylamide in presence of surfactant-dispersed multi-walled carbon nanotubes. Ionic conductivity was introduced to the hydrogels by partial hydrolysis in alkaline medium and the conductivity was compared using Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy. The composite hydrogels with different loadings of carbon nanotubes were characterized systematically by Differential Scanning Calorimetry, Scanning Electron Microscopy and Swelling studies. © 2014 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

abstract={The utilisation of recycled coarse aggregate obtained from demolished concrete has gained momentum in recent years due to its contribution towards sustainability by minimising the use of artificially produced materials and eliminating environmental problems due to dumped waste materials. The present research exploited the possibility of producing high-volume fly ash (HVFA)-based recycled aggregate (RA) high-strength concrete. It was found that 50% of desired strength could be achieved even with 50% replacement of cement with fly ash and 50% of natural aggregate (NA) with RA. An attempt was thus made to study the effects of RA and HVFA on durability characteristics. The parameters considered were resistance to chloride ion penetration, acid attack, sulfate attack and sorption. It was found that replacement of NA with RA and cement with fly ash in higher volumes showed a way of considering economy and environmental effects as criteria, given a little bit of compromise towards strength and durability criteria but still falling well within an acceptable limit.},

abstract={Mesoporous materials possessing pore sizes in the range 2-50 nm and surface reactive functionalities have elicited immense interest due to their exciting prospects in bone tissue engineering. Fabricating these mesoporous materials as continuous fibers adds an additional feature, which can be exploited for biomedical applications especially in tissue engineering. Though there are several factors involved in the remodeling of a damaged tissue, the design of scaffold plays an important role in tissue remodeling. The present work reports the fabrication of a bioinspired 3-D sandwich construct of mesoporous silica fibers and gelatin for bone tissue engineering. The silica nanofiber mesh and the gelatin gel mimic the collagen network and the glycosaminoglycan gel in the native extracellular matrix. Tetraethyl orthosilicate, polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) and the tri-block copolymer P-123 were electrospun to fabricate continuous ordered mesoporous silica nanofibers by optimizing solution and process parameters. The 3-D scaffolds offered a suitable microenvironment for cell infiltration and tissue in-growth. The bioactivity of mesoporous silica fiber along with 2-D gelatin film was found to promote viability of human osteoblast-like cells (MG63) and alkaline phosphatase activity. Gene expression profiles of collagen I, alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, osteopontin and bone sialoprotein indicated good osteoblast proliferation, maturation and infiltration on the sandwich constructs. This novel silica-gelatin 3-D scaffold possesses promising characteristics for enhanced bone tissue regeneration. © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Nasal drug delivery has become more prominent compared to other conventional routes as it improves both systemic and local availability and effects of drugs. The in-situ gels are colloidal sol which undergoes sol to gel transition through internal trigger like temperature or pH, when administered in-vivo at the target sites like ocular, nasal, vaginal, etc. Administration of Celexocib as in-situ gelling system for nasal route could enhance the bioavailability and therapeutic activity of the drug. In this paper, optimization of the in-situ gelling system of Celecoxib using polymers like pluronic F127, carbopol 934P and the effect of incorporating inclusion complex of drug with β-cyclodextrin into the insitu gels were studied. The rheology of the sol and gel systems was found show pseudoplastic behaviour, and with incorporation of drug inclusion complex, the gel viscosity was found to decline. The dissolution studies showed 100% drug release for the gels containing inclusion complex of drug, as compared to in-situ gels with plain drug providing sustained release maximum 12% drug at the end of 6 hours. Characterization studies such as FTIR, XRD, DSC and SEM confirmed the formation of inclusion complex of drug, and also no significant interaction between drug and polymers when incorporated into the in-situ gelling system. Celecoxib thermoresponsive nasal in-situ gelling system with 15% pluronic F127 was optimized to provide sustained release effect. The addition of cyclodextrin complexed drug in the formulation prove enhancement in the dissolution of the hydrophobic drug in aqueous environment, whereby in-vivo bioavailability can be improved.},

abstract={Information gathering is one of the main functions in the arbitrary wireless sensor network. How productively we gather the information from the whole sensor node to the sink node. In most of the practical applications, sensors are not deployed properly; it leads to an improper data collection. Consequently, it is important to study the limit of information accumulated in the arbitrary sensor network. The hierarchical clustering can be used to build a cluster by merging or splitting of the node in the network. The time utilized for sensing the node as a part of the system is more for the sensor organize, so it requires the most extreme measure of energy. The cluster can be formed by the group of nodes and it contains the cluster head. In this paper, we include the clustering method to reduce the sensing time and give an efficient energy. Instead of sensing all the nodes individually, only the cluster head can be used to collect the data in the arbitrary network. The member node of the cluster sends the gathered information to the cluster head from that the information might be exchanged to the sink node. © Research India Publications.},

The proposed converter consists of two stages; a controlled rectifier converting AC supply to DC supply and a multilevel inverter converting DC supply to AC supply cascaded to the rectifier. Multilevel inverter is preferred for the proposed system, since it increases the number of output voltage level and hence the Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) is reduced. Thus the single phase induction motor drive is fed with less harmonic AC voltage which will increase the overall efficiency of the system. For a Single Phase Induction Motor drive, the auxiliary winding is connected to inverter; voltage of the same can be adjusted using the principle of Direct Phase Angle (DPA) control by giving feedback control signals to the rectifier by means of a perfectly tuned PID controller. The Performance of the single phase induction machine under different operating conditions is presented. Overall system is simulated using MATLAB/SIMULINK. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={The AIVB2IIO4 compounds such as cadmium tin oxide (Cd2SnO4 or CTO) and zinc tin oxide (Zn2SnO4 or ZTO) are synthesized by solid state reaction of the subsequent binary oxides. The synthesized powders were analyzed through the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). Cell search done on the PXRD patterns shows that the Cd2SnO4 crystallizes in orthorhombic structure with space group Pbam and the cell parameters as a=5.568(2) Å, b=9.894(3) Å, and c=3.193(1) Å and the Zn2SnO4 crystallizes as cubic with the space group Fd3̄m and with the cell parameter a=8.660(2) Å. Rietveld refinement was done on the PXRD patterns to get the crystal structure of the Cd2SnO4 and Zn 2SnO4 and to define the site deficiency of atoms which causes the electrical properties of the materials. © 2014 K.

abstract={Proliferation of spectrum-based service, in the recent years have forced the human society to become highly dependent on the radio spectrum. It is therefore not surprising that we are facing a difficult situation in wireless communications. Cognitive radio, a novel spectrum sensing paradigm, detects the presence of the user who has legal rights over the spectrum. This allows spectrum utilization by the primary user and in their absence the unused spectrum is allocated to the secondary user, thus potentially eliminating the limitation on wireless communication. In this paper, a simple spectrum sensing technique, energy detection method has been analyzed.The proposed work focuses on enhancing the performance of the energy detection technique by efficiently minimizing the sensing time required to find spectrum holes. This improved performance can be realized by replacing Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) with DWT. A new and novel method of fourth power of detection is performed unlike the conventional powers of operation and the ROC curve is plotted for various parameters. Multi Input Multi Output scheme can be incorporated so as to overcome the problem of noise uncertainty and to achieve good diversity. All these advances enhances the system performance, which results in reduced sensing time to detect the spectrum holes. © IDOSI Publications, 2014.},

abstract={As per Moore's Law the growth of transistors in VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) chip is doubled for every 18 months. Due to this rapid improvement, testing the VLSI integrated circuit for fault free conditions requires large duration of times. Hence this research paper going to propose the data compression technique using Hamming Encoder and Decoder to reduce the test time with small area overhead on chip. The novel methodology also reduces the switching activity between the modified test inputs which lead us to reduce the test power dissipation during testing. The estimation of area overhead is also determined through implementing the additional hardware component of novel circuit with the Field Programmable Gated Array (FPGA) SPARTAN III kit using XILINX ISE Design Suite 14.7 version tool. The entire hardware component of the chip is described using Hardware Description Language (HDL) Verilog.

abstract={An abrupt change in the concentration of lactate in children below the age of three has been related to hepatic immaturity. An electrochemical lactate biosensor was developed by successfully binding lactate dehyrogenase (LDH) onto Fe3O4 nanoparticles via nafion. Towards this design, Fe3O4 nanoparticles were synthesized by thermal co-precipitation method of ferric and ferrous chlorides. The structural and morphological properties of iron oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles were characterized using X-ray Diffractometer (XRD) and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM) respectively. Polycrystalline nature of Fe3O4 nanoparticles was confirmed from the XRD data. The size of the spherical shaped Fe3O4 nanoparticles was found to be 24.97±4.98 nm. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) was used to confirm the binding of LDH to Fe3O4 nanoparticles. A lactate detecting electrochemical biosensor was developed by fabricating a gold electrode modified with Fe3O4 nanoparticles for LDH immobilization (Au/NanoFe3O4/LDH). Amperometric and cyclic voltammetric current of lactate biosensor were used as an analytical signal to study the detection mechanism of lactate. An appreciable linear response to lactate at concentrations ranging from 0.02 to 0.14 μmol L-1 was observed with the response time of &lt;1 s, detection limit of 1.28 nmol L-1, quantification limit of 4.22 nmol L-1 and sensitivity of 320 nA nM-1 cm-2. The apparent Michaelis-Menten constant (Kapp M ) and maximum change in current (Imax) values measured of the immobilized LDH were 0.024±1.3×10-2 μmol L-1 and 0.98 μA respectively. The developed bio-electrode with nano-interface showed high stability and very good reproducibility. Copyright © 2014 American Scientific Publishers.},

abstract={In the retina, increased inflammatory response can cause visual impairment during HIV infection in spite of successful anti-retroviral therapy (HAART). The HIV-1 Tat protein is implicated in neurodegeneration by eliciting a cytokine response in cells of the CNS, including glia. The current study investigated whether innate immune response in human retinal Muller glia could be immune-modulated to combat inflammation. Endocannabinoids, N-arachidonoylethanolamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol are used to alleviate Tat-induced cytotoxicity and rescue retinal cells. The neuroprotective mechanism involved suppression in production of pro-inflammatory and increase of anti-inflammatory cytokines, mainly through the MAPK pathway. The MAPK regulation was primarily by MKP-1. Both endocannabinoids regulated cytokine production by affecting at the transcriptional level the NF-κB complex, including IRAK1BP1 and TAB2. Stability of cytokine mRNA is likely to have been influenced through tristetraprolin. These findings have direct relevance in conditions like immune-recovery uveitis where anti-retroviral therapy has helped immune reconstitution. In such conditions drugs to combat overwhelming inflammatory response would need to supplement HAART. Endocannabinoids and their agonists may be thought of as neurotherapeutic during certain conditions of HIV-1 induced inflammation. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The Randić index R of a graph G is defined as the sum of (didj)-12 over all edges vivj of G, where di denotes the degree of a vertex vi in G. q1 is the largest eigenvalue of the signless Laplacian matrix Q=D+A of G, where D is the diagonal matrix with degrees of the vertices on the main diagonal and A is the adjacency matrix of G. Hansen and Lucas [18] conjectured (1) q1-R≤32n-2 and equality holds for G≅Kn and (2)q1R≤{4n-4n,4≤n≤12,nn-1,n≥13 with equality if and only if G≅Kn for 4≤n≤12 and G≅Sn for n≥13, respectively. In this paper, we prove the conjecture (1) and obtain a result very close to the conjecture (2). Moreover, we give some results relating harmonic index and the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Cancer remains one of the major contributors to human mortality and a hazard to human growth. The search for a new treatment continues unabated. Aurora kinases play an important role in cell cycle, and thus a potential target for the treatment of cancer. In the present work, we aim to discover potential leads against aurora kinase using various rational methods of drug discovery. The available crystal complexes of AKs were analyzed for their interactions and quantified with glide-extra precision (XP) docking. About 20 crystal pdb were selected from the protein databank based on the resolution factor, R-factor and R-value. And after docking with the native ligands, the RMSD value was calculated, wherein the protein with the least RMSD was found to be 3UOK which was further used for our screening of small molecules from the in-house database by molecular docking. Fragments which were found to possess the best interactions were considered for the synthesis with characterization, and biological activity was carried out against breast cancer and colorectal cancer cell lines to assess the inhibitory capability of synthesized compounds. Molecule with the molecular id IS2 i.e. (3E)-3-(5-fluoro-2-oxo-1,2-dihydro-3H-indol-3-ylidene)-2H chromene-2,4(3H)-dione was found to possess inhibitory activity with an IC 50 of 1.324nM and 5.785μM for breast cell line and colorectal cell line studies, respectively. © 2014 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={Wireless Sensor Networks, which utilize multi hop communication and also enable propagation through the network via routing. Sensor nodes are mostly constrained by confining power supply because it is battery powered. Efficient power supply management is a challenge in such a network. In WSN, battery act as the energy source for all the sensor nodes. Due to the limited capacity of power available, it is essential to achieve the minimum energy consumption of each sensor node. In this paper, process of different scheduling, routing and clustering based methods have been reviewed for lifetime maximization. Here backbone Scheduling is also analyzed to reduce the traffic by turning off the non backbone nodes during transmission. Transmission range of sensor nodes depends on the power available. Power consumption is the major constraint which can be reduced by decreasing the radio duty cycle. Here we included the security related concern for preventing the data loss. It also deals with low energy consumption for preventing physical attacks than the other cipher algorithm.

Here we use filters for the encryption process of the original image, the original image is filtered first and then the filtered image is obtained. Then, we subtract the original image with the filtered image and we end up with subtracted image.

The main driving force for this paper is that out of the total number of frauds that surface out more than 80% is done by the bank in-staffs themselves and the remaining by intruders. The system proposed can almost eliminate this menace and thereby make the system more secured. The embedding of biometrics with Cryptography can enhance the security of the system to the fullest extend. The security key for the purpose is extracted by random number generation method. A dedicated hardware random number generator circuit is being employed for this.

abstract={Micro finance is the process of formation of groups to support the poverty incapacitated people by extending money without any collateral security. Micro finance includes savings accounts, insurance products and credit provided to low income unbanked people to increase their economic status in the society. Micro-insurance is a shelter against the hazards of low-income people in exchange of a premium in proportion with the possibility and cost of risk associated. A micro-insurance policy may be a general or a life insurance and done through Non-Government organizations, Self-help groups and Micro-finance institutions. Life Insurance Corporation of India has three micro-insurance products namely, Jeevan Madhu, Jeevan Mangal and Jeevan Deep. The main objective of this study is to find out the need for micro insurance among unbanked people and to find out whether micro insurance helps the unbanked people to enhance their livelihood. Simple random sampling is adopted for the collection of primary information from 150 respondents from Tiruchirapalli town by administering a questionnaire. The data collected were analyzed with the help of statistical tools like Percentage analysis and Chi-square test using SPSS package. The respondents revealed that joining in SHG linked LIC results in the overall socio-economic empowerment in their individual lives. The study concludes that the LIC should create more awareness among unbanked people to improve their standard of living by bringing them under the beneficial umbrella of micro insurance. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Securing Grid protection in Wireless Sensor Grids (wireless sensor networks) several attacks that have been recognized in wireless sensor network till now by the researchers and still it's increasingly becomes critical. Sybil attack is one of the harmful attacks against sensor Grid where a number of appropriate individualities and forged individualities are used to get an inappropriate entry into the network. Essentially a Sybil attack means a system which pretends its individuality like further nodes. In this scenario a system can trust the reclose system and it start sharing its data. Due to this activity a node's safety is affected and data is lost. In this paper, a survey is done on Sybil attack and projected a mutual RAI - Relate and Identify Tactic and LVT Location Verification technique to avoid these attacks. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={The digital age has really challenged the future of traditional media like newspapers and broadcast television. This can be associated with many of the recent developments such as the World Wide Web, the emergence and fragmentation of media, and the popularity of social networking media which have reshaped the media dynamics. Though television is categorized as a traditional medium still its relevance and reach is quite obvious as viewers spend considerable time on this. Further, the competition across various channel categories is intensifying and we have a good number of channels in the 'news' category at regional, national and international levels. As these channels compete for a sizeable viewership, it becomes imperative to know what the viewers' expect and perceive regarding the programme content so that the channels stand to gain a high TRP (Television Rating Point). This study was conducted in Tamilnadu with the primary objective of analyzing the news viewing habits of people and to find out the viewer's opinion about Private TV News channels with reference to awareness, positioning and program content and how it influences the viewers' satisfaction level. 200 respondents were approached with a structured questionnaire containing items on the above mentioned objectives from Chennai. The results indicate that there is a strong preference among the viewers for an edutainment oriented programme in place of mere current news. Further, health awareness, travel and lifestyle programmes are very much expected. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={The change of technology and demanding competition has led the telecommunication business community to denote the vigour of human resource. Now, the organizations are probing the best skilled human resource to employ and retain for the sustainable development and competitive advantage for their organization. This encourages management to provide a good HR climate to develop employee's core competencies and it enables to focus the importance of roles, job descriptions which employees plays and engages in their organizations. This study evaluates the supportive climate of management and HRD systems prevailing in one of the leading public sector BSNL. This study also intends to recognize the employees' insight towards HRD climate and how BSNL is positioning itself in OCTAPACE culture relevant to demographic variables. The data were collected from 508 employees of 26 SSA CSC circles in Trichy district through structured Human Resource Development Climate questionnaire developed by researchers [13]. The present study measured the general climate and OCTAPACE culture in BSNL. Irrespective of the employee's different age group, experience and qualification, the employees view on general supportive climate is quite general. However the findings of the present study precised that there is still ample scope for development in other dimensions of HRD climate as well as OCTAPACE culture which needs to be given more attention by the top management of the public telecom companies with respect to reward and appreciation and customers with care and affection and need to be competitive at par with more importantly by providing feedback for treating private entries. © 2014 IEEE.},

This study examines the applicability of the service quality measurement scale SERVPERF in the Food service industry. Perception of Service quality in terms of the service performance (SERVPERF)dimensions, namely tangibles, responsiveness, empathy, reliability, and assurance, and its relationship with customer satisfaction, and purchase intention have been examined, in this service domain. This study can be considered unique in that it proceeds to examine customer's perception of SERVPERF dimensions as antecedent to both customer satisfaction and customer purchase intention in the food service industry. The regression function obtained confirm the Service Performance variable to cause relatively higher variations in the Purchase Intention than Customer Satisfaction (53% and 32% respectively) indicating the significance of the Service Performance dimensions in the Food services.

abstract={The objective of current study is to assess the hepatoprotective effect of the ethanolic extract of Solanum xanthocarpum fruit in rat liver injured with carbon tetrachloride. The damage of the liver was studied in the experimental animals by assessing total protein, total bilirubin, cholesterol, serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT), triglycerides, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT), in serum. The effect of co-administration of ethanolic extract of fruits of Solanum xanthocarpum (200 mg/Kg) on the above parameters was investigated. Hepatic damage was demonstrated with high levels of all parameters in serum of experimental animals which received carbon tetrachloride. The antioxidant assay of plant extract was proved against hydrogen peroxide and phospho molybdate assay. It is concluded that the fruits of Solanum xanthocarpum are rich in antioxidant and acts as a hepatoprotective agent and attenuates the hepatotoxic effect of carbon tetrachloride.},

Maximum xanthan yield (7.1 g/l) was obtained with 0.5% sulphuric acid pre-treatment. Further, increase in sulphuric acid concentration caused formation of inhibitory substance and lowered xanthan yield. The product was confirmed as xanthan using FTIR, 1H NMR analyses. Viscosity was measured by Brookfield viscometer and the molecular weight was determined from the intrinsic viscosity. The results confirmed that the yield and quality of xanthan produced were strongly influenced by the acid concentration. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The current study was conducted to elucidate the effect of genetic variations in one-carbon metabolism on the epigenetic regulation of major histocompatibility complex II transactivator (MHC2TA), reduced folate carrier 1 (RFC1/SLC19A1) and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). PCR-RFLP/AFLP, bisulfite-sequencing and real-time PCR approaches were used for genetic, epigenetic and expression analysis respectively. SLE cases exhibited elevated plasma homocysteine levels compared to healthy controls (24.93 ± 1.3 vs. 11.67 ± 0.48 μmol/l), while plasma folate levels showed no association (7.10 ± 2.49 vs. 7.64 ± 2.09. ng/ml). The RFC1 80G>A polymorphism showed 1.32-fold risk (95% CI: 1.02-1.72) for SLE, while glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII) 1561C>T showed reduced risk (OR: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.24-0.90). The expression of RFC1 (0.37 ± 0.09 vs. 0.60 ± 0.17) and HLA-DR (0.68 ± 0.17 vs. 0.98 ± 0.02) was down regulated in the SLE cases. The hypermethylation of RFC1 as observed in the current study may contribute for its down regulation. Plasma folate and thymidylate synthase (TYMS) 5'-UTR 28. bp tandem repeat showed an inverse association with methylation of RFC1 and MHC2TA. SLE cases with hypocomplementemia showed hypermethylation of RFC1, hypomethylation/up regulation of MHC2TA and down regulation of HLA-DR. The hypermethylation of MHC2TA and down regulation of RFC1, MHC2TA and HLA-DR were observed in anti-cardiolipin antibody positive SLE cases. The up regulation of RFC1 and HLA-DR was observed in anti-dsDNA antibody positive SLE cases. The hypomethylation/upregulation of RFC1 and MHC2TA was observed in anti-RNP antibody positive cases. To conclude, one-carbon genetic variants influence epigenetic of MHC2TA and RFC1, thus contributing to phenotypic heterogeneity of SLE. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The term 'Web Services'(WS) are waxing as an inventive mechanism for depicting services to immanent devices over the World Wide Web. As a outcome of the speedy emergence of WS applications and the flock of Service Providers, the requestors is confronting with the inevitability of locating the "best Service donor. In such a circumstance the Quality of Service (QoS) serves as a prey to distinguish Service Providers. To first-rate the finest Services / Service donor, Optimization and Services ranking over the Web Service Compositions are exigent areas of research with momentous entailments for the realization of the "Web of Services" revelation. This work from its experimental results revealed that the existing Web Composition based search mechanism faces a few challenging issues such as poor prediction of the services availability, which leads to delay of granting services. To subdue these identified consequences, the anticipated work dealt with Diagonal Matrix Intrigue (DMI) scheme implementation in the Web Services Composition. From the observational leads, it is instituted that our projected mechanism improves the performance of the System in terms of performance time and which leads to an efficient space utilization on the Composition. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={The transmission of the digital images needs large bandwidth and large amount of space to store. To efficiently handle the digital images the compression is needed. There are lots of methods and the algorithms are existed to achieve the image compression. All those methods and algorithms are used to reduce data, which is sufficient to represent the image. It also reduces the unneeded information in the images.JPEG, is the well known lossy compression algorithm. In this quality of the image is traded-off to get decreased file size. This proposed method presents a novel approach using the Chrominance of the color images to achieve the trade-off and to compress the original color image.

abstract={The exposure of alumino silicate materials such as fly ash, rice husk ash, silica fume etc., under goes thermal activation along with alkaline environment forms an environment friendly material called geopolymer. These materials not only contribute reduction in emission of carbon dioxide gas to the atmosphere but also these modern materials act as a substitute for cement to meet with the future demand. In this study an attempt has been made to produce silica fume based geopolymer concrete and to find out its compressive strength characteristics by considering the parameters such as ratio of alkaline liquid (AL) to silica fume (SF), ratio of silicate to hydroxide (SiO3/OH) and the age of geopolymer concrete with constant percentage of silica fume. Detailed experimental investigations were carried out to assess the effect of the above mentioned parameters on compressive strength. From the results it was understood that with AL/SF = 0.30, SiO3/OH= 1.5, for thermal curing temperature of 60°C, for curing period of 56 days and 80% replacements of silica fume, yielded better compressive strength when compared to conventional concrete under normal curing. Hence use of silica fume based geopolymer concrete is recommended for construction.},

This becomes necessary task because with the growing demand for bandwidth for wireless connectivity, it has become essential to come up with innovative solutions to tackle the demand. Multiband Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (MB-OFDM) offers a compelling answer for higher bandwidth and data rate requirements. The performance of multi band OFDM has been tarnished by narrow band interference due to the existence of primary users in the UWB spectrum. This occurs due to the leakage of spectral interference power. Despite the fact that Multiband OFDM has the inherent capability to mitigate the interference, independent mitigation techniques become necessary when the interference level is too high. In this study, interference mitigation is carried out by filtering action at the receiver. Results of simulation are compared to analyze the performance of the filters. Further steps have been taken out to enhance the performance of multiband OFDM system which in turn will be helpful in mitigating the interference. © 2014 Maxwell Scientific Organization.},

abstract={Interphase transport between atmospheric gases and water surface is achieved economically achieved through mass transfer principles. It also establishes a solid relationship between oxygen saturation concentration of liquid and oxygen concentration of gas. The concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO) is one of the important parameter used to assess the quality of water. Improvement of DO concentration in polluted water bodies ensures the endurance of aquatic organisms. In addition to it, Oxygen is important for all algae, macrophytes and also for abundant chemical reactions that are important to stream and lake for its effective functioning. Aeration process is possible in the open channel by providing suitable stepped cascade system, which is possible based on prevailing site conditions. Substantial air entrainment is promising in the air - water interphase due to the plentiful of turbulence creamed in it. This paper illustrates the experimental investigation of Potable water (PW) with and without deoxygenation of water. The experiment was conducted for seven different flow rates and in stepped cascade aeration system constructed for 1.80 m height. This work was carried by varying the tread dimensions of the step by keeping constant channel width and step height. A regression equation using dimension-less parameters was developed based on the results from the experiments.},

abstract={Background: Currently, the discovery of effective chemotherapeutic agents poses a major challenge to the field of cancer biology. The present study focuses on enhancing the therapeutic and anti cancer properties of atorvastatin calcium loaded BSA (ATV-BSA) nanoparticles in vitro. Methodology/Results: BSA-ATV nanoparticles were prepared using desolvation technique. The process parameters were optimized based on the amount of desolvating agent, stabilization conditions as well as the concentration of the cross linker. The anti cancer properties of the protein coated ATV nanoparticles were tested on MiaPaCa-2 cell lines. In vitro release behavior of the drug from the carrier suggests that about 85% of the drug gets released after 72 hrs. Our studies show that ATV-BSA nanoparticles showed specific targeting and enhanced cytotoxicity to MiaPaCa-2 cells when compared to the bare ATV. Conclusion: We hereby propose that the possible mechanism of cellular uptake of albumin bound ATV could be through caveolin mediated endocytosis. Hence our studies open up new facet for an existing cholesterol drug as a potent anticancer agent. © 2014 S et al.},

The physiochemical characterization of the synthesized samples including electron microscopy, nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms, MAS 29Si-NMR, FT-IR demonstrate a distinct change in the morphology and micropore area due to the different dicarboxylic acids used during synthesis. Our results show that the decrease in chain length of the dicarboxylic acid has a direct relation to the increase in micropore area which has a significant role in the adsorption properties of mesoporous silica.

abstract={Death-associated protein kinase (DAPK) undergoes activation in response to various death stimuli, and they have been associated with an increase in DAPK catalytic activity. One of the most prominent features of DAPK-induced cell death is the effect on the cytoskeleton, including loss of matrix attachment, and membrane blebbing. One known cytoskeletal-associated substrate of DAPK is the myosin-II light chain, phosphorylated by DAPK on Ser19, thus stabilizing actin stress fibres. Moreover, paxillin, a component of focal adhesions, was found to be localized in close proximity to the tips of the DAPK-positive filaments, indicating that stress fibres containing DAPK extend to focal contacts. Forced expression of DAPK in multiple cell types results in morphological changes such as cell rounding, membrane blebbing, shrinking and detachment. During directed migration, DAPK functions as a potent inhibitor of cell polarization, as evidenced by its perturbation of the formation of static protrusion at the leading edge. Furthermore, DAPK inhibits random migration by suppressing directional persistence. One of the studies considered DAPK as an anoikis inducer. Others showed that DAP-kinase inhibits the activities of cell surface integrins by converting them into an inactive conformation. Biochemical experiments have established the DAPK binding to Syntaxin1 and its subsequent phosphorylation at Ser188 in a Ca2+ dependent manner. This phosphorylation event has been shown to decrease the binding of Syntaxin to MUNC18-1, a protein critically involved in synaptic vesicle docking. Here, we have investigated the structural interactions that modulate DAPK phosphorylation with Syntaxin and its functional role in binding to the MUNC18-1 to regulate vesicle docking. This review will summarize our current knowledge of the role of DAPK on cytoskeleton reorganization and report the mechanisms that regulate these changes. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Method validation is important in analytical chemistry to obtain the reliability of an analytical method. Guidelines provided by the regulatory bodies can be used as a general framework to assess the validity of a method. Since these guidelines do not focus on the reliability of analytical results exclusively, this study was aimed to combine a few recently evolved strategies that may render analytical method validation more reliable and trustworthy. In this research, the analytical error function was determined by appropriate polynomial regression statistics that determine the range of analyte concentration that may lead to more accurate measurements by producing the least possible total error in the assay and can be regarded as a reliable weighting method. The reliability of the analytical results over a particular concentration range has been proposed by a Bayesian probability study. In order to ensure the applicability of this approach, it was applied for the validation of an HPLC-UV assay method dedicated to the quantification of cefepime and tazobactam in human plasma. A comparison between the newer approach and the usual method validation revealed that the application of analytical error function and Bayesian analysis at the end of the validation process can produce significant improvements in the analytical results. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Slope gradient, relief, aspect, curvature, land use, soil, lineament density, flow accumulation and proximity to roads were the landslide conditioning factors we considered in order to assess susceptibility. The weight of evidence model uses the prior probability of occurrence of a landslide event to identify areas prone to landslides based on the relative contributions of landslide conditioning factors. A pair-wise test of conditional independence was performed for the above factors, allowing the combination of conditioning factors to be analyzed. The contrast (difference of W+ and W−) was used as weight for each factor’s type. The best observed combination consisted of the relief, slope, curvature, land use and distance to road factors, showing an accuracy of 86.1 %, while the accuracy of the map with all factors was 83.9 %. © 2013, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={The present study demonstrated the neuroprotective effect of curcuminoids, the active polyphenols of Curcuma longa (L.) rhizomes on mitochondrial dysfunctioning in middle aged and aged female Wistar rat brain. Rats were orally treated with curcuminoids (100 mg/kg) for 3 months and their brain was collected for evaluation of mitochondrial enzymes and complexes activity, ultra structural changes in mitochondria, neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) protein expression, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and lipofuscin content. Significant alterations were observed in all the tested parameters in highly aged rat brain when compared with young control. Long term curcuminoids administration prevented this age associated loss of mitochondrial enzymes and complexes activity in middle aged rat brain except for malate dehydrogenase, Complex II and IV activity when compared with young control. Among aged rats, curcuminoids treatment specifically elevated isocitrate and NADH dehydrogenase, cytochrome c oxidase, Complex I and total ATP content. A significant down-regulation of nNOS protein expression along with reduced lipofuscin content was also observed in curucminoids treated middle aged and aged rats. Thus, it was suggested that curcuminoids may act as a putative drug candidate for the prevention of deleterious effects of ageing and age associated neurodegenerative disorders through amelioration of aberrant mitochondrial functioning. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={Purpose: Delayed onset of, and low magnitude of, protective immune responses are major drawbacks limiting the practical utility of plasmid vaccination against rabies. In this study we evaluated whether nanoformulation with the novel poly(ether imine) (PETIM) dendrimer can enhance the immunogenicity and efficacy of a plasmid-based rabies vaccine. Materials and methods: A plasmid vaccine construct (pIRES-Rgp) was prepared by cloning the full-length rabies virus glycoprotein gene into pIRES vector. Drawing upon the results of our previous study, a dendriplex (dendrimer-DNA complex) of pIRES-Rgp was made with PETIM dendrimer (10:1 w/w, PETIM:pIRES-Rgp). In vitro transfection was done on baby hamster kidney (BHK)-21 cells to evaluate expression of glycoprotein gene from pIRES-Rgp and PETIM-pIRES-Rgp. Subsequently, groups of Swiss albino mice were immunized intramuscularly with pIRES-Rgp or PETIM-pIRES-Rgp. A commercially available cell culture rabies vaccine was included for comparison. Rabies virus neutralizing antibody (RVNA) titers in the immune sera were evaluated on days 14, 28, and 90 by rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test. Finally, an intracerebral challenge study using a challenge virus standard strain of rabies virus was done to evaluate the protective efficacy of the formulations. Results: Protective levels of RVNA titer ($0.5 IU/mL) were observed by day 14 in animals immunized with pIRES-Rgp and its dendriplex. Notably, PETIM-pIRES-Rgp produced 4.5-fold higher RVNA titers compared to pIRES-Rgp at this time point. All mice immunized with the PETIM-pIRES-Rgp survived the intracerebral rabies virus challenge, compared with 60% in the group which received pIRES-Rgp. Conclusion: Our results suggest that nanoformulation with PETIM dendrimer can produce an earlier onset of a high-titered protective antibody response to a plasmid-based rabies vaccine. PETIM dendriplexing appears to be an efficacious nonviral delivery strategy to enhance genetic vaccination. © 2014 Ullas et al.},

abstract={The electronic transport property and band structure of pure gallium nitride, oxygen, fluorine, indium substituted gallium nitride nanoribbon and defect structured GaN nanoribbons are investigated by employing first-principles studies using density functional theory. The band structure of pure GaN and indium substituted GaN nanoribbon shows a semiconducting nature. The oxygen, fluorine substituted GaN and defect structured GaN results in metallic behavior. The density of states provides the insight for the localization of charges in the valence band and conduction band. The substitution of oxygen and fluorine enhance the density of charges in valence band and conduction band. The substitution of indium shows an increase in the peak amplitude in density of states. The presence of defect also increases the density of states. The transport properties are studied in terms of transmission spectrum; pure GaN and indium substituted shows a same trend in transmission. In contrast, the transmission can be enhanced by the substitution of oxygen, fluorine and defect in nanoribbon. The information provided in the present study will pave its way to tailor a new material of GaN nanostructures with improved performance in the optoelectronic devices. © 2014 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={Streptococcus mutans is the principal pathogen causing human dental caries which can switch between planktonic and biofilm (plaque) forms on oral surfaces. This eventually leads to the development of dental caries and a marked reduction in the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment. The objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of the compounds characterized from the bark ethanolic extract of Melia dubia (quorum sensing inhibitor) that could curtail the biofilmformation and subsequent adhesion of S. mutans and synergistically bolster the activity of antibiotics by regulation of gene expression. The results reveal that at a concentration of 20μg/ml, the extract has a consistent biofilminhibitory action that also corresponds to a near-normal cell growth, suggesting the absence of antibiotic activity. This concentration of extract shows a considerable increase in biofilm inhibition and reduction in cell growth when used in combination with penicillin (MIC of 30mg/mL) and gentamycin (MIC of 10mg/ml). This Quorum Sensing Inhibitor (QSI) in the bark extract has a great potential in eliminating the biofilm of S. mutans, especially when used in a combinatorial control regime with penicillin and hence is a promising solution to eradicate the complications arising out of dental plaque formation. © 2014 Trade Science Inc. - INDIA.},

abstract={Bacteria accomplish various tasks necessary for their survival through Quorum Sensing (QS), a Process that ensures synchronization of their activities at the genetic level, which brings about favourable phenotypic changes. Highly pathogenic organisms, such as Enterohaemmorrhagic E.coli (EHECO157:H7), useQS as an importantmechanismfor establishing virulence and biofilm formation in host cells. These infections lead to haemorrhagic colitis, which could progress to a clinically critical condition termed Haemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS). Earlier investigation of our research group has implicated that compounds derived fromMelia dubia, shows SdiA selective biofilminhibition of Uropathogenic E.coli (UPEC). One such compound, QQ SdiAM, was tested as an SdiA antagonist of EHEC O157:H7 strains. QQ SdiAM was found to be effective at low concentration (MBEC of 1 μg/ml), and the results of biochemical assays performed showed that it has potent anti biofilmactivity.Autoaggregation and cell surface Hydrophobicity reduced upon treatment, as did acid resistance. The % hemolytic activity also decreased in sdiA+ strain upon QQ SdiAM treatment. Swarming motility showed an increase upon treatment. Expression of FtsZ cell division protein decreased by 51% in sdiA+ strain. In all these tests, the compound showed little to no effect on the "sdiA strains. CLSM analysis of strains adhered to HEp-2 cells showed significant decrease in biofilmparameters such as thickness and biomass, in sdiA+ strain. The compound also had high % cell viability (92%) at its MBEC value. These results suggest not only that QQ SdiAM is a potent antagonist of SdiA, but it is an anti-biofilm compound as well. © 2014 Trade Science Inc. - INDIA.},

In consistent to this report, our prime interest was to develop and validate a global inhibitor against these variants using peptidomimetic approach.As one of theAIP variant (AIPII) also reported to show weak activator of its own and cross inhibitor of the others, its response domain (macrocyclic ring)was theoretically substituted with the aminoacids (glycine, phenylalanine, isoleucine, tyrosine) that had earlier showed significant in inhibiting virulence effect of S.aureuskeeping constant the conserved residue, cysteine. The AIP-II mimics, mAIP-II [1] and mAIP-II [2] that showed the best glide score on docking with the protein AgrC variants individually were synthesized to confirmits biological competitivemode of action in the presence of 100nM of naturalAIP of its respective groups using reporter strains. The mAIPII[ 1] was further validated in invivo rat protection test and the histopathological studies showed the infiltration of neutrophils in the infected region among diseased groups, where in treated groups the region consists of predominantly lymphocytes and angiogenesis, a clear confirmation of healing process.

abstract={Lysozyme, one of the most expensive and commercially available enzymes is mostly exploited from the chicken egg white. It is commercially used as a cell disrupting agent, food additive and in the treatment of ulcers and infections. It is an antimicrobial enzyme that hydrolyzes the beta-glycosidic linkage between N-acetylmuramic acid and N-acetyl glucosamine in the peptidoglycan of bacterial cell walls and can also bind to polymers of Nacetyl glucosamine. This study focuses on the isolation and purification of the enzyme from Quail egg white. Experiments were carried out using Ammoniumsulphate precipitation and Aqueous two phase extraction and the protein content was found to be high in Aqueous two phase extraction when compared to the Ammonium sulphate precipitation. The protein concentration and enzyme activity were estimated using Lowry's method and turbidimetric assay respectively. The purification process was further increased by performing Gel filtration Chromatography and the fractions were confirmed using 12% SDS gel and the molecular weightwas found to be ~14k Da which is almost similar to that of the chicken egg. The secondary structure of lysozyme extracted from Quail egg white was performed by FTIR analysis and compared against standard lysozyme sample. © 2014 Trade Science Inc.-INDIA.},

abstract={Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) is accountable for maternal and neonatal morbidity and about a third of the pregnant women have UTI at some point of gestation. Staphylococcus aureus is one of the microorganism commonly found causing UTI and is of high concern due to high occurances of multi-drug resistance. The epidemiology of the disease among pregnant women in the region of Thanjavur was studied to obtain an understanding of the prevelance of UTI and the organisms causing it. S. aureus uses Quorum sensing as a means of communication, which is regulated by the pleiotropic pathways of Agr/ Sar. To tackle the microbe, the efficacy of the extracts of Melia dubia, a plant known for its antimicrobial properties, has been employed. The crude library of compounds from Melia dubia extractswas discovered to have anti-biofilm rather than bactericidal properties. Docking studies were executed with the characterized compounds bindingwith Sar andAgr receptors to predict the pathway of quorum quenching activity. ©2014 Trade Science Inc. - INDIA.},

abstract={Lower organisms need to communicate with each other to perform various activities needed for their survival. Microbes have evolved in an astounding manner to develop tailor-made systems to enhance their chances of existence in harsh environmental conditions. They carry out these mechanisms by synchronizing their actions through cell-to-cell communications. These intra-cellular communications bring about a molecular chain of events to spread infection through biofilm formation and virulence. This review shines a spotlight on the entire Escherichia coli quorum sensing network, especially with regard to SdiA.As is apparent from earlier studies, SdiA acts as a global regulator for E. coli quorum sensing. We propose that by antagonizing SdiA, virulence and biofilm formation can be contained, thus suppressing pathogenesis of E. coli. As an extension, other Gram-negative microorganisms that have analogous circuits to E. coli can also be constrained. © 2014 Trade Science Inc.-INDIA.},

The capsular Hyaluronic Acid (HA) in Streptococcus pyogenes serves as a camouflage, baffling the host immune response. S.pyogenes accesses the host cell through the enzyme "Hyaluronidase" which degrades the Hyaluronic acid in the Extracellular matrix of the host cells. Hyaluronidase- analogous to a nozzle speeds up the bacterial penetration in and around the host cell, thereby daggering the life of host cells. Curbing the anabolism or catabolism of HA by demodulating the enzymes would help in knocking out the infection.

abstract={The Fuel from vegetable oil, which can be considered as a good alternate for diesel is made by a common process called tranesterification. It is the process used for the production of Biodiesel which consists of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) from the triglycerides. In base catalyzed tranesterification process the raw oil should be of good quality and the oil should not have free fatty acid (FFA) and moisture content more than 0.5%. In many cases, large quantity of oils contains higher moisture content and FFA and to transesterify these oils acid catalyzed tranesterification process is preferred which is not sensitive to higher FFA and moisture. One problem with biodiesel is poor low temperature stability. During winter the Northern, Western and Eastern part of India experience temperature from 15°C to 2°C whereas in Southern part the temperature is relatively high with aminimumtemperature of 20°C.Due to the low temperature the saturated fatty acid alkyl esters in the biodiesel bound to crystallize and cause problems in Compression Ignition engine (Diesel engine)when 100%biodiesel is used as fuel. Jatropha is renewable non-edible oil and not expensive compared to other oils like Coconut, Sunflower, Palm, Neem, Rice bran. The aim is to produce vegetable oil based fuel (Biodiesel) using high FFA Jatropha oil by acid catalyzed tranesterification process using methanol with sulfuric acid as catalyst. The reaction is carried out at 65° C - 70 ° C for 14 hours. The biodiesel obtained is washed with hot distilled water and dried in oven at 105°C. Winterization of biodiesel is then carried out at different temperature from 35°C - 0°C for a period of 12 hours and solid fractions are filtered and weighed to find its usability at different cold temperatures. © 2014 Trade Science Inc. - INDIA.},

abstract={Fish oil is extensively used in food, pharmaceutical industries and in general it is expensive, but low cost fish oil is used in leather industry for Chamois leathersmanufacture. Oils in general, whether it is vegetable oil or marine oil, have higher viscosity and hence it takes longer time for penetration into the skin during oil tanning. In-addition, a significant amount is wasted in the drumduring processing due to high viscosity of oils. Jatropha oil, is non-edible oil that is used for making soap, bio-fuel etc. is relatively cheap compared to fish oil. Therefore, in this study jatropha oil was trans-esterified using methanol and sulphuric acid to obtain jatropha oil methyl ester which is low in viscosity and this product is used for making chamois leather. This leather was tested for different properties such as water absorption and its strength. The experimental results show that the leathers made using jatropha oil methyl ester has similar properties that of conventional chamois leather and jatropha oil methyl ester could be a substitute to raw fish oil. © 2014 Trade Science Inc. - INDIA.},

abstract={In present study various species of Jatropha were evaluated for antidote nature induced by phospholipase A2 (PLA2) cobra venom. Although qualitative phytochemical analysis exhibited less variation across Jatropha species studied, substantial variability in terms of PLA2 inhibition by various solvent extracts across the species and between different parts of same plant was observed. Among all samples methanolic extracts of J. gossypifolia leaf showed highest inhibition of PLA2 toxicity while some aqueous extracts of J. foetida and all aqueous extracts of J. curcas, enhanced PLA2 activity. Present results highlight Jatropha not only as rich source of secondary compounds with antidote property for snake bite but also potent toxic agents as revealed with increased hemolysis by some aqueous extracts of J. curcas and J. foetida. Our findings suggest that methanolic leaf extract of J. gossypifolia contain potent small molecular antagonist(s) to the snake venom PLA2 which will be very useful to design adjuvant therapies in treatments of snake bites.},

abstract={A simple post-co-precipitation strategy is adopted for the construction of a mesoporous silica framework in which the rare earth gadolinium oxide (Gd 2O3:Eu3+&amp; Gd2O 3:Sm3+, Eu3+) is incorporated as an emissive probe for optical and bio-medical applications. The samples show good emission along with the required theranostic properties. In the blue region, a better red emissive behavior is observed in the case of Eu3+ doped sample while the Sm3+ and Eu3+ co-doped sample exhibit the same in the near ultra-violet region. Moreover, the structural and textural properties of mesoporous silica are preserved even in the presence of rare earth doped Gd 2O3 and this can very well be utilized for theranostic applications. A clear confocal microscopy image shows a red spot, and thus its potential towards trackability is confirmed. In addition to this, other admirable properties are also associated with it namely, an excellent drug loading ability, bio-compatibility, easy surface modification by the targeting moiety and excellent longitudinal relaxivity (T1) under magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which stands par for it to be utilized in the field of theranostics too. This material shows good luminescence properties along with the desired internal-external morphology, and a narrowly ordered porosity can validate the application of these materials in multi-faceted fields such as phosphors for LEDs, bio-imaging, theranostics etc. © 2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={Hepatic immaturity is observed particularly in children whose age is under three, when the lactate concentration is greater than the normal level in blood. An electrochemical lactate biosensor was developed by immobilizing lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) on to ZnO nanorods at pH 7.4 via chitosan. Growth of polycrystalline ZnO nanorods towards (101) plane was confirmed using XRD. The FE-SEM study revealed the formation of ZnO nanorods with an aspect ratio of 3.24. Immobilization of LDH on ZnO nanorods was confirmed using FTIR spectra and surface coverage. Electrochemical studies were carried out through cyclic voltammetry and amperometry using three electrode system with Au/NanoZnO/LDH as working electrode, Ag/AgCl in 0.1M KCl as reference electrode and Pt wire as counter electrode. The sensitivity of the biosensor was found to be 1.832 μA μmol-1 L exhibiting linearity 0.2-0.8μmol L-1 with the detection and quantification limits of 4.73 and 15.75nmol L-1 respectively. The response time of Au/NanoZnO/LDH bioelectrode was found to be&lt;1 s. Prediction band for net current was framed to enhance specificity. Michaelis-Menten constant (KMapp) and maximum rate (Imax) values for immobilized LDH were found to be 0.38μmol L-1 and 2.798 μA respectively. Repeatability and reproducibility of LDH biosensor were also reported. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Ethnopharmacological relevance Herbal and herbo-mineral preparations are being traditionally used in Indian medicines. The herbo-mineral preparations have several benefits that have been instrumental in their widespread use in treatment of different disorders by traditional medicinal practitioners. These include better stability, lower dosage, ease of storability and sustained availability. Naga bhasma (lead sulphide ash), a traditional Indian herbo-mineral medication prepared using lead and several herbal ingredients, has been used as an oral medicine in India for many years for the treatment of diabetes, spleen enlargement, diarrhoea and various skin diseases. The elaborate preparation protocol involved in the traditional medicines is believed to modify the toxic nature of the precursor (metal) and adds therapeutic value. But modern scientists claim that these preparations are toxic to health as they contain large amount of metal. Many factors such as preparation based factors, chemical nature based factors, vehicle used, therapy associated factors, pharmacological factors, etc, determine whether the traditional medicines are toxic or not. This review focuses on the safety and critical issues associated with Naga bhasma-a lead based ayurvedic medicine. Materials and methods The detailed review of literature about Naga bhasma apart from other lead based formulations are carried out by utilizing the resources including, classical Indian text books, databases such as Pub med, Scopus, Science direct and few other web sources. Results Though metallic lead is known to be toxic to the biological system, no compelling evidence has been put forth to suggest any toxic manifestations of Naga bhasma. The elemental characterization of preparations containing Naga bhasma has shown extremely high levels of lead content and various parameters must be taken into consideration in deciding the safety and critical issues present in traditional medicines. As there are no molecular targets available for most of the traditional medicine, it is difficult to assure the safety in using this traditional preparation. Highly intensive research encompassing physico-chemical, engineering as well as biological aspects need to be carried out to understand the applicability of such preparations in a modern context.

abstract={Greenhouse gases, C02 Dioxide Carbon; CH4 Methane, Nitrous Oxide N20, HFCs Hydro fluorocarbons; Periluorocabonos and PFCs and SF6 Sulfur Hexafluoride cause global warming. Since C02 is the dominant greenhouse gas, these are generally referred to as Carbon gas. In order to save the world from global warming, United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was adopted in 1992 and Kyoto Protocol was signed in 1997 as a follow up measure, which came into force from 2005. Kyoto Protocol fixed ceilings on the emission of green house gases (GHGs) by the developed countries. These countries have set limits to GHG emissions by their own industries and others. The European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EUETS) is the main pillar of the European Union in meeting its commitments under the Kyoto Protocol. Three market based mechanisms have been designed to encourage the reduction of green house emissions, which are (1) Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), (2) Joint Implementation (JI), (3) International Emission Trading (IET). The developed countries which are bound to reduce their emissions can discharge their commitments by purchasing the Carbon Emission Reduction entitlements (CERs) from the other countries which have implemented green house gas reduction projects. The CERs or carbon credits are traded in the international and Indian commodity exchanges at market determined prices. In India, Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) has become the first Asian exchange to trade in carbon credits. It has been reported that about 300 Indian companies are already trading in carbon credits in MCX. This study analyses the factors which can affect carbon trading and hence, the future green house gas emission. © 2014 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

abstract={Enzymatic transesterification of crude non-edible Calophyllum inophyllum oil with high level of free fatty acid (FFA) was investigated. As acid/alkali transesterification for biodiesel production requires expensive pre-treatment and is energy consuming, enzymatic conversion using immobilized lipase is preferred for oils with high FFA. In the present work, sugarcane leaf ash is used for synthesis of SBA-15. The SBA-15 was subsequently functionalized with carboxyl, amino, thiol, and phenyl groups for the lipase immobilization. Amine-functionalized mesoporous silica showed maximum percentage immobilization (49 %) and specific enzyme activity (9.858 U/mg) for immobilized lipase. Under optimal conditions for processing 2 g of Calophyllum inophyllum oil: lipase immobilized on amine-functionalized SBA-15-125 mg, methanol/oil molar ratio-6:1, water-15 % v/v and temperature-35 °C the percentage yield of methyl ester was 94 %.

abstract={Honey is a substance made from nectar and sweet deposits from plants are gathered, modified and stored in the honey comb by the honey bees. In this case Apis species are of importance, due to the changes in viscosity, the consistency of the honey can be fluid, viscous or partly or entirely crystallized. Similarly, depending on the plant origin, the flavor, aroma, chemical composition and the count of pollen varies. No pollen or constituent particular to honey may be removed except where there are unavoidable circumstances in the removal of foreign inorganic or organic matter. The objective of my project emphasizes the study of chemical composition of raw and processed honey, to study the chemical characterization of raw and processed honey, to identify the floral and geographical origin of honey samples collected from Apis species and to draw a conclusion on the importance of raw and processed honey samples collected from Apis species. The tabulated results meet the Codex Alimentarius Standards. The comparison is made between the raw honey and the processed honey samples and conclusions are drawn to identify the better out of it. The raw honey samples were found to be effective than the processed honey samples and the methods used for labelling of the raw honey samples were cost effective, accurate and time efficient and according to the Codex Alimentarius standards. © IDOSI Publications, 2014.},

abstract={Bee Venom (BV) is a highly protein rich substance secreted by the worker and queen bees. It contains pharmacologically important constituents. Melittin is the major constituent present in bee venom and it has been reported to have anti-diabetic and anti-microbial property. Application of bee venom has shown its efficiency for various ailments. For the present study two populations namely test and control were choosen for the anti diabetic activity and the test population was categorised as before stinging and after stinging by Apis cerana bees. The results were compared with the standard values of the blood sugar, cholesterol and triglycerides. The test populations showed very low blood sugar, cholesterol and triglyceride compared to the control population. In test population the average count of eosinophil was around 7%, normal range is around 1-5%. This increase in eosinophil count is due to release of histamine from the bee venom. The lower levels of blood sugar and cholesterol in test population are evident for the anti diabetic activity of bee venom. Malassezia furfur, dandruff causing lipophilic yeast was tested for its susceptibility to bee venom. Ketoconazole was used as reference standard. Out of the five different venom concentrations used, 5mg/ml concentration of A. cerana venom showed 86.9 mm2 inhibition. Thus value added natural products of bee venom can have a great impact in the near future to control diabetes mellitus, dandruff and various other afflictions. © IDOSI Publications, 2014.},

abstract={Edible oils are recognised as essential nutrients in the human diet as they are one of the concentrated sources of energy that provide essential fatty acids, the building blocks for hormones needed to regulate body systems. The intense frying of oils causes thermal reactions, including hydrolysis, oxidation, polymerisation and isomerisation, resulting in thermal degradation of the oils. Heating stimulates the formation of peroxides, triacylglycerol and carbonyl compounds, which decrease the nutritional value of the oils. This leads to destructive diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, colon cancer, atherosclerosis and others. In the present study, palm and groundnut oils are subjected to four cycles of heating to frying temperature, and changes in their composition are studied using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The variation of the oil viscosity with heating time is also observed and is found to correlate with the composition of fatty acids in the oils. © Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2014.},

abstract={Ever since the human mind gave birth to technology, adopted it and dedicated itself to enhance it for human ease, the need for an efficient technique that supports accelerated data rates is vital. To add on to the scenario, the spectrum utilization which has reached its pinnacle places before us a major challenge. Hence the need for an accomplished and unbiased use of the spectrum has become our main focus. After years of pondering over the above mentioned problems a solution has been arrived named Multiband Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (MB-OFDM). Efficient error control codes form the basic building blocks of any system designed for a perfectionists requirement and it is these error control codes that enhances the data rate of MB-OFDM system. Rising demands have made single error control codes inefficient. This crisis can be overcome by concatenating error control codes which exhibit consequential improvement in coding gain. This study consolidates MB-OFDM system with following enhancement: the use of error control codes namely turbo codes, Reed Solomon codes and convolution codes in multiband-OFDM system. In addition improvement in spatial diversity is achieved by using Alamouti technique and finally Alamouti code is concatenated with error control codes and results are compared. As a supplement the fast Fourier transform of the multiband OFDM system is replaced by wavelet transform. © 2014 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

abstract={To access cloud services the user needs to negotiate a service level agreement (SLA) with the service provider. There will be inadequate assurances to customers on whether the services are trustworthy to pick. Trust management plays a major role in guiding the users to access trustworthy services. Hence a trust mining model (TMM) is proposed to identify trusted cloud services while negotiating an SLA. The knowledge is discovered from a previously monitored dataset and a trust value is generated. The proposed trust model helps both the service provider and cloud user, where the user can make a decision on whether to continue or discontinue the service with the service provider. A Rough set and Bayesian inference are used together to generate the overall results. Using rough sets previously monitored data are mined and the indiscernibility in them is analyzed. Bayesian inference is applied to infer the overall trust degree. The accuracy of the results is compared with the previous models and the result shows that the TMM gives better accuracy. The model is simulated using CloudSim. © 2014 The British Computer Society 2014. All rights reserved.},

Electrostatically actuated Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) of torsional actuators are modeled for analog and digital application. In this paper the electromechanical behavior of a torsional micromirror is modeled from a static analysis. Pull-in parameters are crucial limiting factors on deciding whether the particular MEMS device is to be actuated in digital or analog mode. Pull-in voltage is taken as the main parameter for this static analysis and the pull-in calculations are done by using normalized equations. Increasing or decreasing of pull-in angle limit which is an important functional aspect in fixing the application requirement of the analogue/digital mode actuation. The pull-in voltage and pull-in angle could be tailored for these applications by torsional stiffness of values hinge. In this modeling, the hinge stiffness is taken as tuning parameter for the pull-in voltage. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Pull-in study of an electrostatic microactuator is essential for making the electrostatic actuation more effective. Electrostatically actuated Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) of torsional actuators are modeled for analog and digital applications. In this work the electromechanical behavior of a analog torsional micromirror is modeled from a static analysis. Pull-in parameters are crucial limiting factors on deciding whether the particular MEMS device is to be actuated in digital or analog mode. Hinge stiffness and pull-in voltage are taken as the pull-in performance parameters for this analysis. Increasing or decreasing of pull-in voltage limit which is an important functional aspect in fixing the actuation requirement. The pull-in voltage limit could be modified for these applications by changing torsional stiffness values of hinge and electrode location parameters. In this modeling work, the hinge stiffness is taken as tuning parameter to vary the pull-in voltage limit. Particle Swarm Algorithm (PSO) and Fuzzy Logic tools were used to optimize the electrode location parameters. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Renal ischemia reperfusion injury contributes patho-physiological imbalance of acute renal failure that comprises of generation of reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide and peroxynitrite and inflammation involving cytokine/adhesion molecule cascade, finally leads to cell death. Oxygen deprival associated with ischemia that in turn lead to decline ATP production is the characteristic feature usually addressed in the development of in vitro cell based ischemic model. In order to create oxygen deficit in the cell lines different approaches like chemical induction, enzymatic induction and anaerobic chamber models are widely used. However efficiencies of these models were varied and the present study was aimed to compare the suitability of these models in creating in vitro ischemia reperfusion in cell culture. In the chemical induced method we used different concentrations of rotenone, antimycin and sodium azide to inhibit electron transport chain and thereby reduced the ATP production, measured indirectly by cell viability assay. Among the chemical induced model, antimycin mediated cell injury was more reliable for ischemia reperfusion study. In the enzymatic model, comprises of glucose oxidase (3mM/s) and catalase (998 s -1 at 10:1 ratio) was used and found to be best among the three approaches as it can create injury in short experimental time and are reproducible. However anaerobic chamber method was not suitable for ischemia reperfusion study as it need more time to induce significant cell injury.},

abstract={Context Aware Systems and applications are based on acquisition of context information. Most commonly used context in context aware system is location. Many workers have attempted to identify the users location accurately in both indoor and outdoor environments separately. In this paper an effort is made to propose Context Aware Guidance System using Ultra Wide Band (UWB) and Global Positioning System (GPS) technologies for mixed indoor and outdoor environment respectively. The indoor position scheme uses time based technique whose output is further optimised using Quasi-Newton method. Then it uses Unconstrained Kalman filter and Constrained Kalman filter to track the user in real time. In outdoor environment, GPS gives real time location of mobile user. Mixed effecf of the UWB and the GPS technologies have to provide the positioning of the target in the transition region. This paper describes a model for this proposed system and finally evaluates its performance using MATLAB simulation. © Research India Publications.},

Most of the clinicians are familiar with Asymmetry, Border, Color and Diameter (ABCD) analysis to predict and diagnose the melanoma. Asymmetry plays a major role and it will be one of the best indicators to confirm the presence of cancerous melanocytes. When the images of melanoma skin lesions are subjected to preprocessing and it is investigated with the help of emerging techniques such as Evolutionary Programming, Fuzzy Logic, Artificial Neural Networks and Genetic Programming and Algorithms, it will provide better assistance for the clinicians to predict the melanoma at a very early stage.

abstract={Data Mining is used as a service by the organizations/companies who does not have the sufficient resources for computations and storage of data. So, the data owner outsources the data to the third party service provider for their mining needs and to maintain the organizational data. As the organization's data are private and need to be protected, the data owner uses some techniques to protect the data, such as encrypting the items and constructing fake transactions for the encrypted database. And when the data owner wants the frequent patterns to be mined, the transformed items are recovered back to original items and with exact support. The drawback here is the size of the fake transactions which are unwanted. This work discusses on how to reduce the size of the fake transactions without compromising the security and privacy of data.

A stationary four stroke, direct injection (D.I) diesel engine capable of developing 4.45kW at 1500 rpm was modified to operate in LHR mode. In the present work the cylinder liner was machined for 0.5 mm thickness and laminated by thermal barrier coating for the same thickness. The engine cylinder liner was coated with lanthanum zirconium oxide (La<inf>2</inf> Zr<inf>2</inf> O<inf>7</inf>) using plasma spray process. Nearly two third of fuel's energy is rejected as heat from any engine. The heat rejected can be minimized by providing resistance in the heat flow from the engine's surface. In this experimental study, diesel-DEE fuel blend was prepared by mixing 10% volume of DEE with diesel fuel and the effects of diesel and diesel-DEE blend on engine performance and combustion were examined at different loads. The Low heat rejection engine fuelled with diesel-DEE blend shows higher brake thermal efficiency of 32.65% and lower specific fuel consumption at full load conditions due to better combustion compared with conventional diesel engine. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Interactive voice response (IVR) is a technology that allows a computer to interact with humans through the use of voice and Dual Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) tones as input signal via keypad. IVR systems are typically intended to service high call volumes, reduced cost and improve the customer experience. Here we proposed a system to provide student's detail for their parents if communicated through a mobile number provided by the educational institution. A GSM (Global System for Mobile) module with a registered SIM Card is interfaced with the microcontroller (ATmega162). Request for data is made through a GSM Phone line and a pre-recorded voice guides the users to select their option.

abstract={Employee commitment is often regarded as an important benchmark in today's globalized society and competitive business. Profitability in business is a major and fundamental outcome of employee's organizational commitment. The overall organizational effectiveness is the cumulative result of various influential factors such as favorable human resource management policies, superior-subordinate relationship, effective communication, empowering the individuals etc. among which employee's commitment plays a pivotal role. Highly committed employees often demonstrate self control, higher dedication in their actions, and don't wait to be controlled by others. Employee's work commitment towards an organization influenced by work environment, motivation and work-life balance. In this paper, we have made an attempt to ascertain key factors that influence employee commitment towards their organizations in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, where the contributions of expatriate work force is more significant in engineering industries. Data obtained form a randomized survey from expatriate employees working across diverse engineering industries including metal, refinery, petrochemical and power generation in United Arab Emirates, Bahrain & Qatar has been used to characterize the employee commitment towards organization as a resultant outcome of work and personal life balance, environment at work place and motivation. This study also determines that a significant relationship exists among motivation, work environment and work-life balance towards employee commitment. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={The functionality of a gene or a protein depends on codon repeats occurring in it. As a consequence of their vitality in protein function and apparent involvement in causing diseases, an interest in these repeats has developed in recent years. The analysis of genomic and proteomic sequences to identify such repeats requires some algorithmic support from informatics level. Here, we proposed an offline stand-alone toolkit Repeat Searcher and Motif Detector (RSMD), which uncovers and employs few novel approaches in identification of sequence repeats and motifs to understand their functionality in sequence level and their disease causing tendency. The tool offers various features such as identifying motifs, repeats and identification of disease causing repeats. RSMD was designed to provide an easily understandable graphical user interface (GUI), for the tool will be predominantly accessed by biologists and various researchers in all platforms of life science. GUI was developed using the scripting language Perl and its graphical module PerlTK. RSMD covers algorithmic foundations of computational biology by combining theory with practice. © 2014 by the Journal of Biomedical Research. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Aggregate in concrete is a structural filler which accounts for non-porous and impervious behaviour whereas pervious concrete is unique which uses a single size aggregate without fines and it would prove to be effective for growing environmental demands. It also captures rainwater and allows it to seep into the ground. This pavement technology creates more efficient land use by eliminating the need for retention ponds, swell, and other costly storm water management devices. Generally, it has low strength and very good permeability. In this paper, partial replacement of recycled aggregate (RA) for making pervious concrete (PC) was studied. PC was prepared by partial replacement of cement with class F fly ash (FA). The results of various mixes were compared and best mix was proposed based on infiltration and strength. Compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, and water permeability coefficient of the PC were determined. © 2015, International Journal of ChemTech Research. All rights reserved.},

There are different ways through which it is brought about, out of which one of the efficient implementation through steganography and encryption. Steganography conceals the existence of a secret message throughout the communication thereby providing enhanced security. In this study, a methodology has been proposed to perform encryption on an image with the help of Secret Steganography Code for Embedding (SSCE) code. A mapping technique has been proposed to combine quantum truth table and LSB based embedding. The SSCE has been employed to provide encryption, followed by quantum table before embedding the secret data. The proposed methodology supports both images and text as cover as well as secret data. In the proposed scheme, embedding has been included with encryption to provide security multifold. The implementation was carried out using Visual Basic.

abstract={Brobdingnagian may be the precise word for the usage of internet and advanced expertise in the globe in our day. Indeed, all sorts of this online communication go hand in hand with the so called major apprehension, information security. Since all kinds of digital files play an imperative role in internet operation, it is indispensable to defend the key features of private communication namely, seclusion, uprightness and legitimacy. This threat, in a roundabout way, has led to the breakthrough of information security rationales. Striking among these are Cryptography and Steganography, primordial skills pursued for the sake of secret sharing. The startling thing is that with the fruition of technology, these are giving prolific outcomes even now. Cryptography possesses such a litheness that its blend, in the company of other fields of study, facilitates offer much more options to explore security issues. This study envisions an inimitable approach to security in the context of encryption and embedding incorporating shuffling, chaotic equations in conjunction with Blowfish encryption algorithm. Here, encryption is performed on images followed by embedding secret data. The latter is done not literally but indirectly. This pitch endows with randomness and security with all the persuasive traits of encryption. Validation is given in terms of Mean Square Error (MSE), Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Relative Entropy (RE), entropy and correlation values. Experimental results are illustrated to vindicate the performance of this objective. © 2014 Asian Network for Scientific Information},

abstract={This study presents a new Space Vector Pulse Width Modulation (SVPWM) based stator oriented non-linear control of induction motor drive system using MATLAB/Simulink environment. The non-linear control is employed in the stator by making a small change in the variable transformation and this control technique will not affect the system dynamics and improves the performance in all four quadrants. This reduces size and cost of the induction motor drive system. The steady state and transient response of the drive system is observed in all the four quadrants and their torque and speed characteristics were studied. This non-linear control in this system is better compared to other systems. The motor drive is simulated in all four quadrants and their waveforms were plotted. © 2014 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

abstract={Chandraprabha Vati (CPV), a multi-ingredient phyto formulation, is widely used in Ayurveda for the treatment of liver and kidney disorders. In this study, we attempt to elucidate the mode of action of CPV. We specifically focus on the effects of CPV on the transcriptional regulation of Pregnane-X-Receptor (PXR) and its subsequent effects on interleukins, Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor-γ (PPARγ) and type 4 Glucose Transporter (GLUT4). Our results show that CPV up-regulates PXR moderately in contrast to its individual ingredients such as chebulinic acid or linalool that down regulate PXR. Further, the expression of Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), the gene involved in drug elimination, is only moderately up-regulated by CPV, again in contrast to the effect of some of its ingredients. CPV down regulates the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and upregulates the levels of PPARγ, which in turn upregulates GLUT4 expression. These together suggest that the therapeutic properties of CPV can be attributed to its multi-pronged action, viz., prevention of inflammation, moderate expression of PXR that activates several downstream pathways and tight regulation of CYP3A4 thereby slowing down the elimination of the chemical constituents. In addition, these results emphasize on the need for multi-ingredient approach towards designing effective therapeutic formulations. This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2014.},

abstract={Metal coordinating C2-symmetric phenolic chelating ligands (1-3) were used to prepare surface functionalized AgNPs for selective colorimetric sensing of metal cations and anions. The effect of subtle structural and conformational change of 1-3 on the colorimetric sensing was also explored. UV-Visible, IR spectroscopy and HR-TEM techniques were used to characterize AgNPs. Interestingly 1-, 2- and 3-AgNPs showed different colorimetric sensing of metal cations and anions. Aliphatic flexible diamine based 1-AgNPs showed selective sensing of Co2+ ions (10-7 M), oxalate and dihydrogen phosphate anions (10-6 M). Co2+ to 1-AgNPs produced a brownish-orange colour whereas oxalate and phosphate resulted in a brownish-pink colour due to aggregation. Alicyclic diamine based 2-AgNPs exhibited selective precipitate formation for Pb2+ ions without showing any anion sensing. The rigid diamine based 3-AgNPs showed selective decolourisation of the yellow colour for Hg2+ and nitrite anions due to amalgamation and oxidation. Thus phenolic chelating ligands that have been used to generate versatile coordination networks with metal ions offer a simple way to develop AgNPs based potential colorimetric sensors for environmental screening.

abstract={Molecular dynamics simulations have been performed to investigate the structural, thermal and wetting properties of self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of alkane thiol on gold surface. The specific heat capacity of the gold SAM surface was found to linearly increase with the temperature in the range 100-300. K. It was found to drop down at 400. K and this decrease might be attributed to the disorder of the SAM chains. Hydration of gold SAM surface for two different terminal groups, namely methyl (hydrophobic), and hydroxy (hydrophilic) was studied at room temperature. The difference in their wetting behavior and the structure of their interfacial water were examined from the estimation of the z density profile, radial distribution function, hydrogen bonds and orientation of water dipoles in the interfacial region. The present simulation results suggest that the wetting behavior of the gold SAM surface can be modified by altering the terminal functional group of the SAM chains. © 2014 Chinese Materials Research Society.},

abstract={An Assorted topology of hybrid filter in front end system compensates the reactive power and current harmonics. In this study, a various topology of hybrid filter (SSHF) is analyzed in the point of harmonic reduction, power factor and voltage stress in active filter. Three configuration of hybrid filter is taken for the analysis to mitigate harmonics and reactive power. Shunt hybrid filter, series hybrid filter and shunt- series hybrid filter are the different topology of hybrid filter. The combination of active and passive components forms the hybrid filter where the active filter is controlled by adaptive controller. The least mean square algorithm based adaptive controller is preferred where the learning rate is found by trial and error. The passive filter is tuned to the dominant harmonics and the active filter/series hybrid filter compensates other than dominant harmonics. The reference signal for the active filter is the fundamental current attained from the line current and the hysteresis controller switches the MOSFET in order that the line current follows the reference current. The study is carried out in the system by considering the line impedance. The different types of filter are studied with adaptive controller in MATLAB environment. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Information retrieval is the process of finding the user's required data from the vast collection of information. Most of our attempt for any new information begins with a keyword based attempt followed by further refinements. Such keyword based search is very primitive and it often retrieves contents that are less relevant. But finding the optimal solution for the information retrieval from graph is a complicated process and it requires more effort and techniques. We have proposed an approach for knowledge mining by processing the graph using the semantic search. Knowledge graphs are designed to treat web pages as entities and are bound to perform entity-based search, which is basically a graph search technique. Graph-search is a classical problem of Artificial Intelligence. Though, Semantic Web still stands at the corridors of the Knowledge Representation war, Graph-Search can take it to fruitful venues. The GP-CLOSE which is a mining algorithm for knowledge discovery in text databases can be applied on the Knowledge graph of entities with modifications. The Graph searching algorithm AO* can then be used on the knowledge graph to search for the best matching result. This paper is an attempt to meet Semantic web at the earliest. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Employees absent themselves from work due to a variety of factors which include personal, family and health problems, social and family obligations and work related issues like stress, relationship with co-workers and the superiors. Another important reason for absence is the sheer entitlement for leave as per organizational policy. Absenteeism, whether scheduled or unscheduled, causes productivity loss and hurts the general morale of the work place, resulting in the increase of operating expenses. It may be difficult to straight away find a cure for solving the issue of absenteeism, but the key is in identifying the nature and relationship that exists among the various factors causing absenteeism and to take a holistic approach to the problem. This article analyses the factors affecting absenteeism based on a survey conducted with the help of a structured questionnaire containing 13 variables related to the absenteeism of the employee. Data relating to 198 employees working in a manufacturing plant in Chennai, India was analyzed. A theoretical exploratory factor analysis model was built using the three factors identified by the Factor Analysis. Based on the feedback revealed by the modification indices, a revised model has been designed and tested for model fit. © CESMAA 2009 - 2014.},

abstract={In recent years, the amount of non-linear loads has increased considerably since there were improvements in power electronic equipment (such as adjustable speed drives or converter ac-dc, ac-ac, dc-ac and dc-dc) in industrial sectors which cause deterioration of the quality of the electric power supply through distortion of supply voltage and supply current. This has led to improvement of many stringent needs regarding generation of harmonic current, which are found in IEEE519 and IEC61000 standards. This paper proposes a non-linear function based closed loop control strategy (without load current extraction) for three-phase Shunt Active Power Line Conditioner and LC passive filter to compensate harmonics, power factor improvement and enhance the dynamic performance of Shunt Hybrid Power Filter (SHPF). By using a PI controller the DC bus voltage of the Shunt Active Power Filter is maintained constant. Results obtained from simulation shows the performance of expected hybrid filter in transient and steady state operation. This indicates that the controller is able to compensate even under severe load current imbalances. © 2014 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science. All rights reserved.},

The opportunities, threats, strengths and weaknesses (SWOT) faced by public limited companies in Coimbatore District, Tamilnadu, India during the period 2009-2014 have been ascertained through a questionnaire and they were related to their sales and profit performance for the terminal year 2005 with the help of multiple regression. Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) are measured in terms of Total Weighted Scores and these combined with Gross Assets deployed by the responding companies are taken as independent variables and Sales and, Profit before Depreciation, Interest and Tax have been considered as dependent variables. Significant relationship has been found based on the data collected and analyzed. © Maxwell Scientific Organization, 2014.},

abstract={In Warfield, it is impossible to have a pre-installed infrastructure networks, the only way to overcome the problem is to create a wireless infrastructure less networks. In order to communicate between the mobile nodes in the Warfield, each node must have a coverage distance of 200 meters. In this paper, we have chosen ad hoc network as a best infrastructure less networks and incorporated with three different routing protocols like Destination sequenced Distance Vector (DSDV), Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) and Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) in each node. These protocols were tested at two different scenarios such as Army navy force movement scenario and Army land force movement scenario. The performance metrics such as Packet delivery ratio, Average end to end delay, Average throughput, Jitter, Dropping ratio, Total energy consumed, and overall residual energy are obtained from simulated result. © 2014 C.

abstract={Vehicular Ad hoc NETwork is an Ad hoc network used for communication between vehicles within a range of 250 m. In order to make a communication between vehicular nodes we have to finding a valid path between the source and the destination nodes. The most commonly used routing protocols for VANETs are namely Destination sequenced Distance Vector (DSDV), Ad-hoc On demand Distance Vector (AODV) and Dynamic Source Routing (DSR).In this paper these protocols are incorporated at each of the rescue vehicular nodes and equal to the realistic scenario the group of rescue vehicular nodes at the rescue stations are set to move towards the disaster zone of grid based city. To improve the coordination among the vehicular nodes within an each group, communication between head vehicle and other vehicles is established at both movement and rescue operation. The above scenario is created using MOVE(MObility model generator for VEhicular networks), SUMO(Simulation of Urban Mobility) and simulated using NS-2.The performance of these routing protocols is analyzed and compared in terms of packet delivery ratio, normalized routing overhead, throughput, end to end delay, goodput and jitter. © 2014 C.

abstract={In order to achieve a good performance, engine should efficiently perform in various driving scenarios such as low speed driving, turning around a curved path, high speed driving, etc. These requirements can be effectively met if Continuous Variable Transmission (CVT) is used in the transmission system of automobiles. CVT provides continuum of gear ratio between desired limits that maintains engine speed within efficient range irrespective of vehicle velocity. Widely used V-Belt CVT requires large force to produce radial movement of belt which is mounted on the pulley. In this work, CVT is achieved by radial control of the shim which carries the belt. It justifies the velocity ratio between the driver and driven pulley based on output velocity and requires comparatively lesser force to produce movement in belt. Four different models of pulley are modelled in Pro/E. Then, simulation of the CVT pulley is carried out in ADAMS software. To validate the model in terms of its advantage, the proposed radial control mechanism is compared with the conventional V-Belt CVT and manual transmission system. Further, different control mechanism and their results are discussed in-depth. © Research India Publications.},

Albumin nanoparticles were synthesized using coacervation method and the average size of the particles was found to be 97 nm. The particles were stable and showed a spherical morphology with narrow size distribution. We investigated the impact of two stages characterized in type II diabetes mellitus (hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia) on the proliferation of MiaPaCa-2 cells and compared the inhibitory effects of bare metformin to that of MET-BSA NPs. Further, different concentrations of insulin and glucose were added along with bare metformin, bare BSA, and metformin encapsulated BSA carrier on MiaPaCa-2 cells to check the strong association between type II diabetes and pancreatic cancer. The results revealed that MET-BSA NPs showed more toxicity when compared with drug and carrier individually. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={The image enhancement targets on transforming input image as better one, so that the enhanced image solve the purpose of specific application or set of objectives. Histogram equalization is a primitive and well established technique for enhancing image contrast. The existing methods are Range Limited Bi-Histogram Equalization (RLBHE) and Adaptive histogram equalization method. RLBHE works by dividing the input histogram into two independent sub-images with reference to threshold. This minimizes the intraclass variance thereby support fine separation of objects from its background. In Adaptive histogram equalization (AHE), the input source image is divided by equal number of rows and columns, and the histogram for each region is calculated. The histogram of each sub region is used to perform local image enhancement. But both the RLBHE and AHE are very slow and do over enhancement of noise in the image. On the other hand, Retinex algorithms improve the sharpness, contrast and brightness of an image. It also reduces the noise level in the image. It uses OTSU-S method to threshold the images. This paper explains a walkthrough on both histogram equalization and Retinex algorithm techniques by implementing them for image contrast enhancement. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={This study work is basically aimed at designing and testing of hardware module to perform inversion operation of a matrix in a small time. Here, an approach is made for calculating 3×3 matrix inverse. There are many mathematical methods available for performing matrix inversion and out of them a suitable method, like Adjoint Matrix Method is selected by analysing the computational requirements. The mathematical method of calculating the inverse of matrix is then suitably converted into VHDL code. The code is then tested for simulation using a set of test matrices. After simulation is verified by checking the results of test inputs the code is tested for synthesizability. After the synthesizability is verified then it is finally tested for hardware verification by dumping into FPGA. Altera's DE1 board which consists a Cyclone-II series FPGA EP2C20F484C7 FPGA is used for this study. The test inputs can be fed in either by using on board GPIO or UI or S RAM. The outputs are taken the same way either by GPIO or UI or written to S RAM and are then to be verified by comparing with actual results. © 2014 IEEE.},

We implement adaptive filters for the task of separation of FECG signal from the abdominal ECG signal and understand its nature. A Least Mean Square (LMS) algorithm is implemented for the purpose of detection adaptively. Data compression techniques are implemented foe the filtered ECG signal for the purpose of easy storage and transmission. Since the data is more important and sensitive, it is necessary to implement lossless compression with high compression ratio by reducing the redundancy involved in the ECG signal with low noise. A Fast Fourier Transform, Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), DCT-II and Discrete Sine Transform (DST) methods are used here for the purpose of compression.

abstract={Rasasindura is a mercury-based nanopowder synthesized using natural products through mechanothermal processing. It has been used in the Ayurvedic system of medicine since time immemorial for various therapeutic purposes such as rejuvenation, treatment of syphilis and in genital disorders. Rasasindura is said to be composed of mercury, sulphur and organic moieties derived from the decoction of plant extracts used during its synthesis. There is little scientific understanding of the preparation process so far. Though metallic mercury is incorporated deliberately for therapeutic purposes, it certainly raises toxicity concerns. The lack of gold standards in manufacturing of such drugs leads to a variation in the chemical composition of the final product. The objective of the present study was to assess the physicochemical properties of Rasasindura samples of different batches purchased from different manufacturers and assess the extent of deviation and gauge its impact on human health. Modern characterization techniques were employed to analyze particle size and morphology, surface area, zeta potential, elemental composition, crystallinity, thermal stability and degradation. Average particle size of the samples observed through scanning electron microscope ranged from 5-100 nm. Mercury content was found to be between 84 and 89% from elemental analysis. Despite batch-to-batch and manufacturer-to-manufacturer variations in the physicochemical properties, all the samples contained mercury in the form of HgS. These differences in the physicochemical properties may ultimately impact its biological outcome.},

abstract={Nanostructured ZnO films were spray deposited on glass substrates at the substrate temperature of 623 K using zinc nitrate hexahydrate as precursor. The effect of precursor volume on the structural, morphological, optical, electrical and wettability properties of the ZnO film was investigated. X-ray diffraction data confirmed the formation of polycrystalline films with wurtzite structure and revealed the variation of peak intensity as a function of precursor volume and in-turn thickness. Scanning electron micrographs revealed the formation of films with uniformly distributed sphere shaped nanograins with and without voids. The optical and electrical properties of the ZnO thin films revealed the decrease in transmittance and increase in the conductivity when the film thickness was increased by increasing the precursor volume. Contact angle measurement confirmed the role of thickness in fixing the wettability properties of the films. Copyright © 2014 American Scientific Publishers},

abstract={Recent reports demonstrated an increase in the synthesis of nanoparticles (NP) and its applications. The chemical preparation of NP may be harmful. Thus, in this study, the biological activity and toxicology of nickel nanoparticles (NiNP) synthesized through chemical and green routes were compared. Chemical synthesis of NiNP was mediated by polyethylene glycol and hydrazine hydrate as stabilizing and reducing agent, respectively. Desmodium gangeticum aqueous root extract was used to prepare NiNP without any stabilizing and reducing agent. Nickel nanoparticles synthesized by both methods were characterized (ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy, X-ray diffractrometry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, zeta potential and vibrating sample magnetometer) and compared. There was no major significant difference in the nature of the NP prepared by both methods. However, green synthesized NiNP showed reduced size and better monodispersity compared to chemical synthesized one. Free radical scavenging activities and antibacterial activities of NiNP prepared by chemical and green route suggest that these NP, prepared by green route possess reliable antioxidant and antibacterial activity. Evaluation of toxicity in animal and cell line suggests that NiNP synthesized by green route are nontoxic. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

Besides, the effects of spindle speed and feed rate on delamination were also studied with an objective of selecting appropriate drill material and pre-drill size, capable to give minimum delamination. Taguchi's orthogonal array design, an economical experimental design was used to conduct the experiments effectively. The experimental data were obtained by measuring the drilled holes with the help of profile projector. The obtained results were analysed using Signal-to-noise ratio in order to identify the optimal parameters setting for minimum delamination and Analysis of variance was applied to find the significance of the parameters affecting delamination under pre-drilling. It was found that pre-drill diameter and feed rate have shown the significant contribution on controlling delamination and linear regression equations were also established to correlate the drilling parameters with delamination. © Research India Publications.},

Such a “state of the art” performance is possible only when employees are treated with utmost care.

abstract={Geo-magnetically induced currents (GIC) that create undesirable effects in the power system are due to occurrence of large Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) [1] directed towards earth. Conducting paths, such as cables, transmission lines and metallic pipelines serve as paths for geo-magnetically induced currents. GICs enter and exit the power system at transformer grounds, disrupt the normal operation of the power system, leading to damage of the equipment. GIC can even lead to half-cycle saturation of power transformers, generating significant quantum of distortions in the system voltages and currents causing even and odd harmonics. These aspects may in turn lead to undesirable operation of control and protection devices. The proposed paper discusses the origin of GIC, methodology of modeling the induced currents into the power system, and the consequences of their presence in the bulk power system. To analyze the effects of GIC on transformers, a simulation model using MATLAB Simulink® is developed. Since recent studies by researchers have indicated that GICs occur as slow-varying ac current at a very low frequency, such currents are introduced through the grounded neutral of the transformer taken for analysis. The circuit is simulated for various magnitudes of GIC and the resultant waveforms for flux in the transformer core, magnetization current and excitation current of the transformer are observed. The distortion of saturation characteristics of the transformer is also observed and salient features for all the observed waveforms have been summarized. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis is performed to voltages and currents at the primary and secondary side of the transformer and the Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) levels are analyzed. Though recent studies have been carried out by the researchers to deliberate the impacts of geo-magnetically induced currents in a power system, this research article provides an in-depth and detailed overview of the impacts of geo-magnetic disturbances from the analysis of the observed waveforms pertaining to flux, magnetization current, excitation current and saturation characteristics of the transformer. Conclusions are drawn on the various essential requirements that necessitate the normal operation of the transformer and aspects that cause major imbalance in the voltages, active power and reactive power in the system. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Data replication is a process of having multiple copies of same data in all service providers to improve the availability and redundancy. Scheduling is a process of allocating resources to the many requests simultaneously which helps in load balancing. Dynamic environment involves distributed system over a large geographic area. Replication of data around the geography will improve the redundancy and availability of data in the network. Storage space is an important factor that should be considered such that access latency should be reduced to the maximum while replicating the data. Using scheduling techniques in a wise manner will reduce the search time. In proposed work, two parameters are considered for an efficient management of dynamic environment such as consistency of replicas and response time. Consistency of replicas is maintained over all the service providers in a particular zone and response time is highly reduced. EDS reduces the problems in Scheduling strategies by considering factors such as the geographic location of the service provider, transfer time of data response time, turnaround time, availability of data, communication delay and total number of service providers available in a zone. The best location to replicate the data is selected so as the response time is highly reduced. The result clearly shows the proposed scheduling and replication algorithm of a zone with number of service provider gives better performance than other algorithms. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Chromium (Cr) contamination in soil is a growing concern in sustainable agriculture production and food safety. We performed pot experiment with chromium (30 mg/ soil) to assess the accumulation potential of Zea mays and study the influence of four fertilizers, viz. Farm Yard Manure (FYM), NPK, Panchakavya (PK) and Vermicompost (VC) with respect to Cr accumulation. The oxidative stress and pigment (chlorophyll) levels were also examined. The results showed increased accumulation of chromium in both shoots and roots of Zea mays under FYM and NPK supply, and reduced with PK and VC. While the protein and pigment contents decreased in Cr treated plants, the fertilizers substantiated the loss to overcome the stress. Similarly, accumulation of Cr increased the levels of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and peroxidase (POD) indicating the enhanced damage control activity. However, these levels were relatively low in plants supplemented with fertilizers.

abstract={Nanomaterials with stem cells have evolved as a promising therapeutic strategy to regenerate various tissues. Tissue engineered grafts with bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) can offer a cell-based therapeutic strategy for deep wounds like burns and traumatic ulcers. In this study, we have fabricated poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate (PHBV) nanofibers through electrospinning. The adhesion, proliferation and epidermal differentiation of BM-MSCs on PHBV nanofibers were investigated. Epidermal differentiation media containing epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin, 3,3′,5-triiodo-l-thyronine (T3), Hydrocortisone and 1α, 25-dihydroxyvitamin (D3) were used to trigger differentiation of BM-MSCs on PHBV. The proliferation of BM-MSCs on PHBV was significantly higher than the tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) control (p < 0.05). Live/dead staining of BM-MSCs on PHBV nanofibers confirmed the change in morphology of BM-MSCs from spindle to polygonal shape indicating their differentiation into keratinocytes. The expression levels of the genes keratin (early), filaggrin (intermediate) and involucrin (late) that are involved in epidermal differentiation were upregulated in a stage-specific manner. Our results demonstrate the potential of PHBV nanofibers in promoting adhesion and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells. This novel cellular nanofiber construct can be a better alternative to the existing therapies for skin tissue engineering. © 2014, Biomedical Engineering Society.},

Manganese ferrite-ethylene glycol-water nanofluids (1 vol%) were prepared by mixing water and manganese ferrite-ethylene glycol nanofluids (2 vol%). Such nanofluids (manganese ferrite-ethylene glycol-water nanofluids) too exhibited shear-thinning characteristics. Temperature-independent linear increase in thermal conductivity with nanoparticle concentration, higher than those predicted using Hamilton-Crosser model, was observed for manganese ferrite-ethylene glycol nanofluid, which could be attributed to particle clustering.

abstract={Objective: To develop oro- dissolving systems of Carica papaya leaf extract by various techniques to enhance its therapeutic effects.
Methods: Fresh C. Papaya leaf extracts were prepared by the cold extraction and maceration methods. The components of the extract were analysed by GC-MS technique. The concentrated extract was further formulated into liquisolid granules and soft lozenges by the liquisolid compaction and molding methods respectively. Various quality control tests such as weight variation, hardness, thickness and diameter and disintegration were carried out to evaluate the commercial feasibility of the formulations. An XRF and Microbial load analysis was done for the optimized set of tablets and lozenges and the yield calculated.
Results: Both the formulations showed an 80% yield and acceptable flow properties satisfying the required standards for quality. The GC-MS reported the presence of 12 major compounds with a similar spectrum. The XRF results gave the presence of high amounts of potassium(K) and trace amounts of copper and molybdenum. The microbial limit tests showed a total aerobic and fungal count within limits as per Indian pharmacopoeia.
Conclusion: The formulations were found to be stable and within the standard pharmacopoeial limits, satisfying conditions for effective release and action of the active drug. © 2014, Sphinx Knowledge House. All rights reserved.},

For instance, one can witness the usage of teleconferencing, image scanning; smart cards etc have become more common in established firms and companies. Creating a virtual environment of work place in now the drift as it saves generous sum of money spent on travel and other things. Instead of hand delivery as in olden and medieval period, employees scan and send the documents across the globe within seconds through internet. But is it safe to send the credentials as the way it is? It is definitely a risk. To combat this problem, software's and security algorithms are used in the digital world to avoid eaves dropping. As mentioned earlier, technology and business has now become a great combo to deal with. This paper gives a method to defend the information sent from one end where modulation techniques and encryption are employed as the basis. This paper deals with the comparative performance analysis of different modulation schemes like BPSK (Binary Phase Shift Keying), QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying), 8QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation), 16QAM, 32QAM and 64 QAM using concatenated error control codes and chaotic encryption in OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing). Cyclic codes with RS codes has been used as the concatenated error control code. BER Vs Eb/No graphs are plotted using various modulation schemes using AWGN (Additive White Gaussian Noise), Rayleigh and Rician Fading Channels. © 2014 IEEE.},

If Steganography is implemented in the audio signal, the above result is contrary. We focus on the audio steganography for analyzing the behavior for different modulation schemes. The result is controversial (i.e.) PCM is better option for transmitting an encoded audio signal with text information. This result has not been proved yet in terms of coding. The coding is developed in MATLAB. In the algorithm, using the scattering method, the encoded text is embedded into digitized audio signal.

abstract={The workspace is often a critical parameter for optimum design of parallel manipulators. Workspace shape and area are two important considerations under this. In this paper, 5-R and 3-RRR planar parallel manipulators having symmetric link lengths are considered for workspace analysis. Here, symmetric means that the lengths of the first and second links of the legs are the same in all branches. Workspace analysis for such manipulators is normally done in a nondimensional way. The determination of the workspace area is one of the important parameters in the optimum design of a manipulator, and the determination of the area in terms of nondimensional parameters is extremely difficult in the case of 3-DOF and higher-DOF manipulators. In this paper, a geometric method is presented to determine different workspace shapes and areas. Based on this, all possible shapes of workspace are presented for both 5-R and 3-RRR planar parallel manipulators. For each case, a geometrical relationship between the link lengths is determined. The geometric approach gives a closed-form expression for the area calculation, which is not possible when adopting a nondimensional approach. In addition, this approach provides relationships between workspace shape and area and link lengths. Copyright © Cambridge University Press 2014.},

Methods: In the present study 90 patients were selected. The study was comprised of 30 Diabetic mellitus (DM) with microalbuminuria patients (Group 3), 30 DM without microalbuminuria patients (group 2), 30 healthy controls (Group 1). Fasting glucose, post prandial glucose, lipid profile, fructosamine in serum and micro albumin in urine were investigated in all the patients.
Results: The significant increase in serum fructosamine, fasting and post prandial glucose levels along with increased microalbuminuria observed in group 3 patients compared to group 2 and group 1 patients. Hyperglycemia increases fructosamine, cholesterol, triglycerides with decrease in HDL-cholesterol levels, indicates the major risk of atherogenicity. To study the effect of age, smoking, DM duration on DN, patients were grouped in different way and analysed.
Conclusion: The results suggested that smoking, age and prolonged DM influences DN.

Methods: IFM and SSM were obtained from isolated rat heart subjected to different perfusion time namely (minutes) 0.5,5,10,25,60 and 120 through Langendroff perfusion system.
Results: Prolonged perfusion of isolated rat heart reduced oxidative phosphorylation capacity in both IFM and SSM, but were distinct among the sub-populations. However, mRNA expression level of ND4, CYT B and ATP 6 and resazurin activity was similar in both IFM and SSM.
Conclusion: Even though overall function of myocardium is unchanged, mitochondrial sub- populations were distinct in electron transport chain activities, emphasizes the requirement to assess mitochondrial function as distinct subpopulation rather than whole entity. © International Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences.

The biological method was performed by using the aqueous root extract of Desmodium gangeticum and further they were characterized and checked for their biological activities.
Methods: The TiO2 nanocrystals were characterized by UV-Visible spectrophotometer for its maximum SPR peak, X-ray diffractometry for its crystalline size and shape, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy for functional entity identification and Zeta potential for its colloidal stability. Antioxidant assay and antimicrobial test were performed to evaluate its biological behaviour.
Results: The nanocrystals synthesized by biological method were found to have higher antioxidant potential, antimicrobial activity and phenolic content than the chemically synthesized ones. Evaluation of toxicity in cell line LLC-PK1 suggests that TiO2 nanocrystals synthesized by green route is less toxic.
Conclusion: Green synthesized TiO2 nanocrystals were seen to have less toxicity than the chemical method in showing their biocompatibility nature which can be applied in the field of medical science. ©.2014, International Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Science. All Right Reserved.},

Detection and quantification of such a carcinogen poses a major challenge. In this context, a novel room temperature acetaldehyde sensor made up of hierarchical ZnO nanostructures and prepared by a simple and template-free method has been reported. ZnO nanostructures were grown on glass substrates by a chemical spray pyrolysis technique at the substrate temperature of 523 K. Different nanostructures, namely tiny nanoplatelets, branched nanorods and thicker nanoplatelets, were formed by an annealing process. The crystal structures, morphologies and optical absorbances of the hierarchical ZnO nanostructures were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and UV-vis spectrophotometry, respectively. The branched nanorods showed an excellent sensing response towards 20 to 500 ppm of acetaldehyde vapour. The role of high density junctions of the branched ZnO architecture in enhancing the vapour sensing performance has been highlighted. The observed selectivity, range of detection and stability of the branched ZnO nanorods have proven their potential as a sensing element for the detection of acetaldehyde. © 2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={The portable wireless technology with wide accessibility facilitates the people to enter into a new dynamic environment for optimizing the overall productivity. Establishing reliable communication is a challenging aspect, because the signal propagation is heavily subjected to interference and fading effects resulting in severe path loss. In the field of telecommunication system, the effect of Path Loss in the signal is used to analyze and design the link budget system. Previously, many path loss prediction models like HATA, and Okumura are proposed where the path loss is determined with the help of experimental field values and verified with the help of the model graph. In this work, BPSK modulated signal is used to determine the path loss using HATA empirical formula derived with the help of the Okumura curve for various urban, suburban and rural areas. The identified values are given to triangular membership function and defuzzification is performed using faster and flexible center of sum method. The inferred results show maximum loss in case of urban and increases at an average rate of 10dB per decade with distance. The proposed technique optimizes signal transmission by determining the path loss accurately.},

The LPC2148 based underground sensor module continuously monitors and transmits data to the tracking module using zigbee. The PIC protective device wore by labor helps to identify their location using zigbee and the associated limit switch alerts labor in case of improper wearing of PPE. The voice unit attached to underground sensor module gives an emergency command based on the analysis of monitored parameters. In addition the tracking module helps to locate workers through the signal relayed by zigbee protective device.

abstract={The term data mining refers to the process of obtaining knowledge from the available data through patterns and tabulating the information obtained. Data mining techniques are utilized by companies to search Data Warehouses in order to find the different trends, anomalies and relationships. Prediction in data mining involves a model or predictor that would be constructed in order to identify a function which is of continuous value. A basic approach for prediction involves Instance-based, Statistical, Bayesian networks and regression. Making prediction activates one’s prior knowledge about the existing information and helps them make connections between new data and information already known. The study aims at performing Multi level classification and not just classification of binary labels which was dealt with in all of the previous work. By doing so, in depth information can be obtained and a more efficient prediction can be done. This paper aims at classifying the various animal types in a zoo database. The database considered is unstructured and consists of multi labels. Since the animals in a zoo are generally of varying types, our objective is to classify the animals using WEKA Tool and establish the results. Three classification algorithms have been used for classification. A comparative study on the efficiency of these algorithms is made. © Research India Publications.},

The use of the wavelet transform can be ascribed to the fact that it counteracts various types of interference. Implementation of various modulation techniques refines the performance. The order of the wavelet transforms used should remain conducive to establish it as an efficient system for high data rates. As an outcome of noise the output of the channel is erroneous.

Though the Ken Ken puzzle is similar to the existing Sudoku technique of data hiding, the inherent difficulty involved in solving a Ken Ken puzzle is leveraged in this method and the final results after embedding data are then analyzed in terms of the visual quality of the stego-image obtained. This is done by means of certain quality metrics available to test the resulting image quality.

The average energy gap variations for all the possible adsorption sites in MgO nanotube are reported. Mulliken population analysis confirms the transfers of electrons from MgO nanotube to HCHO.

abstract={Psoriasis is a lifelong condition which is caused by the negative signals produced by immune system, which leads to hyper proliferation and other inflammatory reactions on the skin. In this case, keratinocytes which are the outermost layer of skin possess shortened life cycle and results in the alteration of desqua-mation process where the cytokines will come out through lesions of affected patients and as a result, scaling marks appears on the skin. These conditions may negatively affect the patient's quality of life and lead to psychosocial stress. Psoriasis can be categorized as mild, moderate and severe conditions. Mild psoriasis leads to the formation of rashes, and when it becomes moderate, the skin turns into scaly. In severe conditions, red patches may be present on skin surface and becomes itchy. Topical therapy continues to be one of the pillars for psoriasis management. Drug molecules with target effect on the skin tissues and other inflammations should be selected for the treatment of psoriasis. Most of the existing drugs lead to systemic intoxication and dryness when applied in higher dose. Different scientific approaches for topical delivery are being explored by researches including emollient, modified gelling system, transdermal d^ivery, spray, nanogels, hydrogels, micro/nano emulsion, liposomes, nano capsules etc. These topical dosage forms are evaluated for various physico chemical properties such as drug content, viscosity, pH, extrudability, spreadability, toxicity, irritancy, permeability and drug release mechanism. This review paper focus attention to the impact of these formulation approaches on various anti-psoriasis drugs for their successful treatment. © N. Vincent et al., 2014.},

Role based access rights (RBAR) provide a hierarchical model to read and write the data as per authorization and requirement of the implementation logic. The generic models have security drawbacks and are vulnerable to unethical exploits. The proposed model uses broadcast encryption technique and decrypts using respective key. This scheme guarantees, other users/roles are not affected when revoking a user, re-encryption is not needed after user revocation. In this RBAR, the security is improved by limiting the number of users per role, limiting the operations on timely basis and reliability is improved by storing the data for recovery. © 2006-2014 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).},

abstract={Cloud computing enables the end users to easily access internet based applications and data storage services. With the increasing popularity of cloud, providing security to cloud environment has become an important issue. In order to provide security for a cloud environment we require more than the traditional security methods like firewalls, user authentication, access control and confidentiality in data transmission. Hence Intrusion Detection System (IDS) becomes a needful component in terms of cloud security. Many methods are being utilized for the development of effective intrusion detection systems, but none of them is completely secure. In this process of betterment, here we present an intrusion detection system, by applying k-means clustering for anomaly detection and integrate it with a frequent attacks generation module using apriori algorithm to detect frequently occurring attacks in various network environments. To evaluate the performance, KDD 99 CUP dataset has been used in our system. © 2006-2014 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).},

Web service is a software component, which is all articulating highly in the market. Selection and prediction for such a type of component is a tough task for our application. Prism classifier is a statistical tool through which obtaining good classification and ontology for our semantics with number of attributes. Every web service component has its own significance and QOS. Prism classifier generates output considering only high values, resulting in the rules, which contains only the best component, skipping the next components in the priority queue. The drawback in classical prism classifier is rectified by considering the attributes of the component having tie between maximum values. The homogeneity levels amongst a class, variation between the training data sets are also analyzed. By, improving the prism classifier, the resulting rule contains the best of the best component suitable for the customer. The series of tests like Simple Matching co-efficient, Jaccard distances, cosine distance, T-test, ANOVA etc., together with modified Prism classifier is named as IH2RC [Improvised High Hit Ratio Classifier]. In this paper, IH2RC is applied on a training data set, which contains online translators with their related attributes.

Existing research indicates that small increase in the climate and weather extremes which have the potential to bring large calamities to the existing infrastructures. These changes may be due to the presence of uncertainties in values. Many researches were on predicting and it has been a challenging field, so many algorithm deals with it. Such uncertainties are predicted and evaluated using many techniques. In this paper we have predicted uncertainty with some statistical methods like mean and standard deviation on the weather dataset. The error rate, accuracy level makes the system efficiency, which is done in this paper using the statistical measures and removes the uncertainty value in the dataset.

This study focus mainly on to improve the basic knowledge to the DFT with typical exercises using Matlab simulation software tool. Applications are like data compression, power spectrum estimation and an efficient convolution. Power spectrum estimation is useful to understand the frequency content of signal and noise. The efficient convolution is more pertinent to find the response of the system for any arbitrary input. Data compression is more powerful application since this save enormous amount of bandwidth.

abstract={Power attack is the most powerful side channel attacks in cryptography chip during VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) testing. Hackers attack the target devices by means of power through finding the correlations between the power spikes for different input generated on Cathode Ray Oscilloscope (CRO). To overcome such a great issues we proposed the novel techniques for cryptography devices which perform their crypto functions without an external power source. Energy required to do the cryptographic operation is provided by Embedded Capacitance Power Supply (ECPS) method, which is integrated with the VLSI device. Group of capacitors are connected to form the power supply, which act as the temporary battery of the cryptographic chip. The power spikes for this crypto operation not visible by the CRO. Hence it is complicate for attackers to hack the crypto system. The proposed method is modelled through Hardware Description Language (HDL) Verilog-AMS using Switch Level Modelling and result is verified by simulation wave form generated.},

abstract={Wireless sensor network consists of densely deployed sensor nodes which have limited resources like energy, node lifetime. Data aggregation is an effective scheme to reduce redundancy of sampled data generated by sensor nodes. Homogeneous sensor networks easily adapt the data aggregation scheme because of easy synchronization of data samples; but heterogeneous sensor network have difficulty to handle data aggregation due to synchronization of different data packets produced by different sensor nodes. In order to perform efficient data aggregation in heterogeneous sensor networks our proposed method Attribute based Spanning Tree (AST) introduced the method of attribute based spanning tree construction over heterogeneous networks. Based on the characteristics of sensor nodes, logical separation of nodes formed then each group constructs Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), aggregation follows this MST to reach sink node. By adapting Kruskal's algorithm into our proposed method MST is constructed in sensor nodes. Our simulation results shows that AST is more spatially convergent and it uses shortest path cost for aggregation leads to increase node lifetime and saves energy.},

Steganography is called as an art of secret and secured communication. The basic idea behind this paper is to find the best way to embed text data in audio file using the steganography techniques. Our proposed method uses LSB technique only in specific bit positions which are known only to sender and receiver. Our results have shown that the quality of the audio remains same after embedding the secret text and also very less difference between the original audio and steganographed audio. These results were obtained by the estimation of PSNR, MSE and audio features such as Pitch, Entropy and Flatness etc. The size of the audio signal also remains unaltered.},

abstract={One of the most efficient way to utilize the bandwidth in wireless communication systems is Full- duplex communication. It is proposed for full duplex wireless communication over a single channel. The signals are transmitted and received at a same time and same frequency. It creates the large self-interference over the transmitted and received signals and lead to large loss of data. We used different values of phase offset to reduce the self-interference between the transmitted and received signals. The full duplex communication system is designed for input as image and by using wavelet transform. The performance of full-duplex communication system using various modulations like 16-QAM, QPSK and 64-QAM along with Haar, Daubechies2 and Daubechies 4 wavelets over different values of phase offset are evaluated by bit error rate.},

abstract={A Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) represents an ad-hoc network which are able to change locations; which can also perform self-configuration and self-organization in a dynamic environment. Group communication system plays a major part in MANET environment which are implemented by multicasting method which provides delivery of packets to a group of destination. But there are many difficulties in implementing scalable, optimized and efficient multicasting network in mobile ad-hoc network because managing a dynamic environment with group membership is a challenging process. Efficient Geographic Multicast Protocol (EGMP) is proposed which uses a virtual zone base structure. The geographic region is divided into many virtual zones. The Distance between the source and other nodes in the group are found and the one closest to source is chosen as cluster head or zone leader. Zone leader communicates with its group members. Only zone leader transmits data and hence the node does not receive the same packets again and again. EGMP greatly simplifies zone management and packet forwarding. EGMP uses geographic forwarding to provide reliable packet transmission. It ensures the successful transmission of the data packets, has low overhead and reduced redundant packet transmissions. Compared with Scalable Position Based Multicast (SPBM), simulation results of EGMP shows high packet delivery ratio thus packet missing while transmission are reduced hence re-transmission of packets are reduced and bandwidth is utilized efficiently.},

The data that is intended to be transmitted to a particular recipient should be read only by the corresponding person and not anyone else. For this reason, the best way to protect the data is by encryption. This provides security from stealing of data. This paper deals with a mechanism to encrypt a data using flip-flops and double substitution method. The basic idea to obtain blocks of plain text and then use T-flip-flops along with double substitution to result in a convincing cipher text. The result is a cipher text obtained by using plaintext itself for encryption. This algorithm can be used to transmit bit sequence of any length, thus ensuring the usage of bandwidth to desirable level. This method may result in an Electronic Code Book (ECB). The keys used will be asymmetric. The receiver just follows the steps in reverse order to retrieve the data or plaintext from the received cipher text.},

abstract={As the wireless communication greatly depends on spectrum utilization, the increase in demand for new wireless services and their application leads to the spectrum scarcity. In order to utilize the available spectrum efficiently, "cognitive radio"- The demanding technology is introduced. It is a dynamic technology that can sense the medium, utilizes the available white spaces, for transmission by detecting its neighboring devices. The cognitive radio targets to increase the efficiency of the spectrum changes without causing any intervention to the licensed users. Since cognitive radio works in the open network space, it increases the chance of the attacker to show intervene on the spectral medium. So, the security becomes the key factor. This leads to the realization of various security threats in the cognitive radio. There are various papers covering the security issues over the threats in cognitive radio, but this paper provides an advanced survey over attacks and common threats and the possibility of securing the available spectrum from the attackers. In addition to that future scope and challenges are also addressed. This survey will help the researchers to identify the space left out and the problems to be attached related to security issues on cognitive radio.},

abstract={With the growth of subscribers in wireless and data communication there is a scarcity of additional bandwidth to meet the demand. For the efficient usage of the spectrum bandwidth we go for a technology which is Cognitive Radio technique. The spectrum holes in the unutilized spectrum are to be used efficiently for the communication for the secondary user. The Cognitive Radio uses spectrum sensing techniques for determining the spectrum holes in the network. In order to improve the efficiency of the energy detection technique it is combined and used with the statistical Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique. In conventional PCA technique the signal space power to the noise space power does not match with the actual SNR so a PCA correction technique is followed. The correction factor is applied to the noise space power and signal space power to equate it to the actual SNR. The threshold energy required is determined from the modified energy detection technique and the probability of false alarm value. The proposed method is the combination of PCA and energy detection spectrum sensing. The correction factor is applied to the PCA and it clearly defines the process for threshold Energy computation.},

abstract={Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) depends on the dense deployment of sensor nodes over a wide area. In WSN, battery is the most important resource in sensor nodes. The main objective of sensor nodes is comprised of sensing, processing and for communication. It consumes more energy mainly during transmission of data. In previous papers, virtual backbone scheduling for maximizing network lifetime has been proposed. Multiple overlapped backbones are used for scheduling the sensor nodes during transmission. This proposed work integrates Virtual Backbone Scheduling (VBS) with clustering based algorithm for low energy consumption. Here we deploy a node sleep scheduling in the context of clustered networks. Energy Efficient Data Collection (EEDC) is an effective clustering technique for wireless sensor networks. This method is based on hierarchical based clustering for cluster evolution. Therefore it leads to less reduction of energy of each sensor node during communication to the base station. This proposed method has considered to be efficient for energy minimization, data aggregation and so on. © 2014 IEEE.},

The band structure of pristine, boron, gallium and arsenic substituted AlP nanoribbon exhibits semiconducting behavior. The substitution of boron decreases the band gap of AlP nanoribbon. The substitution of group-III semiconductor has much influence in density of states. The major contribution is observed in p and d orbitals. The electron density increases with boron substitution and there is a slight decrease in electron density for gallium substitution. The transmission of AlP nanoribbon molecular device is analyzed with two probe method. The substitution impurity and bias voltage influence the transmission across AlP nanoribbon. From the results, it is inferred that the band structure and electronic transport properties can be fine-tuned with substitution impurity along AlP nanoribbon. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

It is in this respect a study of suffusion has been taken up. A study of collapse of dams, erosion of embankments and damages to buildings due to earthquakes lead us to conclude that suffusion has played a major role in all the above setbacks. Suffusion occurs due to voids and uneven particles in soils leading to seepage force causing damages. This requires analysis of geometric criteria of the soil and hydraulics that causes suffusion. This project attempts at assessment of susceptibility to suffusion through geometric criteria. To have deeper insight and finer evaluation, five different soil samples were analyzed using different methodologies proposed by nine authors. While six methodologies have confirmed that all the samples are suffusive, three methodologies have shown variations and out of these three, Burenkova's methodology is widely used for assessment. Unfortunately this methodology was found to give unsafe results. Wan and Fell (2008) refined Burenkova method and even this refined method was found to give unsafe results. Therefore attempts have been made to refine Burenkova method. Taking up 101 gradations from other studies and 5 from current study, a broader analysis has been done and improved limits have been suggested. Different models have been proposed for widely-graded and gap-graded soils. New models have been proposed based on two ideas. The first idea is that the d90/d60 value should increase as d90/d15 value increases. Second idea is that at lower values of d90/d15 the stable zone will be small and as the d90/d15 increases stable zone also increases. Among the five models proposed for widely-graded soils, model 2 is found to be most appropriate and among four models proposed for gap-graded soils, model 1 is found to be most appropriate. Along with refinement of Burenkova's method, the authors also propose a new better method for finding susceptibility of soils to suffusion. The authors use division between D and d5 for the same. D represents higher diameter at gap location for gap graded soils or higher diameter corresponding to highest value of division between two successive diameters with a difference of 10% (first division alone be for a difference of 5%, between d10 and d5). d5 is the representative of fine grains while D is the representative of voids. D/d5 value less than 4 corresponds to stable soils while greater than 6 corresponds to unstable soils and between 4 to 6 indicates transition zone. © 2006-2014 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).},

abstract={An antifungal bioemulsifier compound was produced from a novel strain of Bacillus thuringiensis pak2310. To accentuate the production and as the first step to improve the yield, a central composite design (CCD) was used to study the effect of various factors like minimal salts (1X and 3X), glycerol concentration (2% and 4%), beef extract concentration (1% and 3%), and sunflower oil concentration (2% and 4%) on the production of bioemulsifier molecule and to optimize the conditions to increase the production. The E 24 emulsification index was used as the response variable as the increase in surfactant production was seen to be proportional to increased emulsification. A quadratic equation was employed to express the response variable in terms of the independent variables. Statistical tools like student's t -test, F -test, and ANOVA were employed to identify the important factors and to test the adequacy of the model. Under optimum conditions (1X concentration of minimal salts (MS), 2.6% glycerol (v/v), 1% beef extract (w/v), and 2% sunflower oil (v/v)) a 65% increase in yield was produced. © 2014 Deepak Rajendran et al.},

abstract={Objective: To synthesize silver nanoparticles (AgNps) from Basella alba(B. alba) aqueous extract using 3 mM AgNO3solution, to characterize the resulted AgNps and also to study the antioxidant activity by DPPH and reducing assay.
Methods: 150 ml of aqueous extract was mixed with 600 ml of 3 mM silver nitrate solutions and kept at room temperature for 1hr. A change from straw yellow to golden yellow was observed and absorption spectra were obtained by UV-VIS spectrometer. The resulted nanoparticles (NPs) were characterized by FT-IR spectrum, SEM-EDS, TEM and XPS techniques. The purity and nature of the particles were observed through TG-DSC analysis. Further, Antioxidant activity was performed by DPPH (2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) method and by Ferric chloride reducing assay.
Results: UV-Vis spectral analysis shows a maximum absorption peak at 435 nm. FT-IR spectrum indicated the formation of reducing and capping agents in AgNps. The synthesized silver nanoparticles was spherical in shape and its size ranges from 22.6 to 25 nm. The synthesized silver nanoparticles possess excellent antioxidant activity by various methods. The phenol carboxylic acid present in B. alba leaf extract acted as a reducing agent which was identified by HPTLC technique. A Protein present in the B. alba extract was responsible for the capping of bio-reduced silver nanoparticles.
Conclusion: It has been demonstrated that Basella alba plant extract could be used as a proficient green reducing agent for the synthesis of AgNPs. Further studies will be focused towards the mass scale production of formulation. © 2014, International Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The realistic structures such as hexagonal ring, hexagonal sheet, ladder and cube isomers of GaAlAs and InAlAs are designed and optimized using density functional theory. The hexagonal ring structure is found to be more stable from the calculated energy. The dipole moments of GaAlAs and InAlAs nanoclusters are reported and hexagonal ring of GaAlAs and ladder structure of InAlAs nanoclusters are found to have a high dipole moment. The point symmetry of GaAlAs and InAlAs nanoclusters has either C1 or Cs symmetry. The HOMO-LUMO gap provides an insight into the transition of the electron for different isomers of GaAlAs and InAlAs clusters. The electron density depends on the geometry of the cluster. The electronic properties are discussed in terms of ionization potential and electron affinity. The hexagonal sheet isomer has the high value of IP and EA due to its geometry. The cube structured GaAlAs and InAlAs nanoclusters have the highest binding energy. The embedding energy is found to be low for GaAlAs and InAlAs hexagonal sheet isomers. The vibrational studies identify the stable clusters of GaAlAs and InAlAs nanoclusters.

abstract={Membrane proteins play important roles in the biological process and accurate discrimination of membrane proteins from non-membrane proteins/globular ones would help to locate them in the genome sequences. However, the structural biology of membrane protein is limited due to the physiochemical complexities in determining its three dimensional structures. Thus the requirement of predicting membrane protein structure from sequence is increased and become a central problem in molecular biology; interestingly, several computational strategies and discriminating parameters were developed for the successful prediction of membrane protein structures. Studies have been reported that the transmembrane helical proteins could be discriminated with the accuracy of 90%, reflects the predation strength of the present algorithms. However, this accuracy fluctuates with other class of membrane proteins indicates the need for better physico-chemical observations of the specific folds. Thus, here performed a preliminary systematic analysis to study the role of various physico-chemicals, energetic and conformational amino acid properties to discriminate the transmembrane (TM) and nontransmembrane (NTM) segments of a and ß class membrane proteins of diverse superfamily. The present study suggests the superfamily based discriminant properties to identify the transmembrane regions. We found that average numbers of surrounding residues, number of long-range contacts and total non-bonded energy can discriminate membrane proteins of all the superfamilies in the dataset with the accuracy of 85-91%. Thus we suggest the addition of these parameters can improve the accuracy of prediction for the specific superfamily.},

abstract={Time and cost are among the important aspects considered for every construction project. Many research approaches have been followed to model time-cost relationship. There is a constant rise in the use of innovative contract methods which provide incentives for maximizing quality. There is an increasing pressure to improve the project performance due to the innovative contracting methods which necessitate developing models incorporating quality along with time and cost. A main contractor normally subcontracts most of the tasks of a project for improving project performance. It is always a complex and challenging task for a main contractor, to choose a correct bid which satisfies the time, cost and quality requirements of a project. In the present study, a differential evolution algorithm is used to solve this multi-objective time-cost-quality optimization problem. Two case studies are analyzed and the results obtained compared with the existing approaches to test the applicability and efficiency of the algorithm. It is evident from the results that the differential evolution algorithm performs efficiently in locating the optimal solution with minimum function evaluation. © 2014, Jordan Journal of Civil Engineering.

abstract={Owing to its high biodegradability, non toxic nature and antimicrobial properties-chitosan, a polymer widely-used as an antimicrobial agent either alone or blended with other natural polymers. On the other hand, graphene oxide (GO) is known for its biocompatible nature, excellent chemical and mechanical properties. Both chitosan (CS) and graphene oxide possess antibacterial activities but individually they cannot be considered as potent antibacterial agents. Hence due to lack of adequate prior studies and in order to broaden chitosan's antimicrobial applicability, we have synthesized chitosan-graphene oxide (CS-GO) nanocomposites and characterized using different techniques to check the combined antibacterial effects of the nanocomposite. The results of UV-visible spectroscopy and FTIR showed the formation of GO and CS-GO nanocomposite, based on the absorbance peaks and the interaction between the functional groups of GO and CS respectively. SEM images of GO was observed with smooth and flakier sheets whereas the morphology of CS-GO composite was found to be rough with GO sheets surrounded by CS molecules. The antibacterial activity was tested against Escherichia coli, a gram negative bacterium and Bacillus subtillis, a gram positive bacterium. The results from these methods showed that the CS-GO nanocomposite with 2 wt% GO content had greater antibacterial activity against both the strains when compared to the activity of CS and GO individually. Overall our studies form the basis of using this nanocomposite as an antibacterial agent for biomedical applications prospectively. Copyright © 2014 American Scientific Publishers},

abstract={LC/ESI/MS/MS data analysis on the phytoconstituents of methanolic extract of Jatropha tanjorensis leaves revealed the presence of abundant flavone glucosides (homoorientin, kaempferol-3-o-rutinoside, luteolin-7-o-glucoside, 6 -C-pentosyl-8-C-hexosyl apigenin, naringin and vitexin), flavonol (kaempferol and kaempferide) and flavones (baicalein and diosmetin). We, herein, demonstrated that methanolic extract of J. tanjorensis possess DPPH freeradical scavenging activity (IC50 of 49.7 μg/mL), inhibition of lipid peroxidation activity (IC50 of 189.6 μg/mL) and anticancer activity through MTT assay against EAC cells (IC50 of 14.57 μg/mL) and Caco-2 cells (IC50 of 21.0 μg/mL). In silico analysis indicated that cytotoxic activity of the methanolic extract of J. tanjorensis could be attributed to the presence of vitexin and 6-C-pentosyl-8-Chexosyl apigenin as evidenced by exhaustive molecular docking studies carried out against 8 proteins of Bcl-2 family that play essential role in apoptosis. Moreover, drug-likeness properties of the leads and scopes to develop them as potent anticancer compounds are discussed. © 2014, Bangladesh Pharmacological Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Flavonoid glycosides are a group of polyphenols with different glycoside substituents that possess diverse pharmacological activities albeit with lesser potency than their aglycone counterparts. Complexation with transition metal ions may alter their pharmacological activity, but this facet has remained unexplored thus far. Therefore, the present study aims to synthesize copper and iron complexes of naringin and investigate their nature of membrane interactions employing erythrocyte membrane models. An attempt to correlate their interaction and localization in the membrane with their cytotoxic effects was also made. Hypotonic hemolysis experiments carried out in the presence of naringin or its complexes with copper or iron reveals their different extent of penetration in to the membrane. Naringin and naringin-iron were found to preferentially interact with the membrane surface when compared with naringin-copper. The transformation of erythrocyte membrane from the normal discoidal shape to an echinocyte form induced by the addition of naringin, naringin-copper and naringin-iron complex suggests their interaction with the outer leaflet of the erythrocyte membrane. Naringin-copper exhibited the maximum tendency to alter the morphology of erythrocyte membranes. The copper and iron complexes of naringin exhibit superior cytotoxicity against MCF-7 cancer cells that can be a manifestation of their degree of perturbation of the membrane architecture as well as different levels of activation of various molecular targets. © the Partner Organisations 2014.},

abstract={Magnonic crystals are periodic composites of magnetic materials for propagating spin waves. The periodic modulation in magnonic crystal plays a vital role in the formation of bandgaps at the Brillouin Zone (BZ) boundaries leading towards possible applications in spin wave filters. In this study, we explore the possibility of tailoring the magnonic bandgap in one-dimensional (ID) square antidot waveguide structures by micromagnetic simulation. The space-time variations of magnetization in these structures are obtained by solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation using OOMMF by applying spatially and temporally varying “sine” function normal to the waveguide plane in presence of a bias field of strength 1.01 and 0.505 T along the length of the waveguide. The dispersion relations are obtained by 2D discrete Fourier transform of the space-time data. We have investigated how the bias field affects the magnonic band structures and the corresponding bandgaps for four different materials. From the results we clearly observe a downward shifting of bandgaps towards lower frequency when the biasing field is decreased while the width of the bandgap remains same. Hence, it provides a simplest way for designing spin wave filters of different frequency regimes. © 2014 Knowledgia Review, Malaysia.},

All fractions obtained were evaluated for their chemical potential using micrOTOF-Q II techniques and identified key molecules were determined for their anticancer and anti-oxidant potential using in vitro methods. Results: Successive column chromatography of the MeOH residue yielded six fractions. Compounds such as such as C-glycosylflavones (mono-C-, di-C-), O, C-diglycosylflavones and aglycones were identified for the first time in this plant using UHPLC-ultraviolet-micrOTOF-Q II ESI and a correlation with their anticancer using 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay on Ehrlich ascites cells (EAC) and antioxidant activities using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and lipid peroxidation were studied; fraction D extract exhibited the strongest activity against cancer cell. Conclusions: LC-mass spectrometry has been successfully applied for a quick separation and identification of the major phytoconstituents. All fractions have shown potent antioxidative activity as compared to standard antioxidant 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxytoluene. EAC cell-based cytotoxicity assay also revealed encouraging results. The antioxidant and anticancer activity determined in the present work can be attributed to the presence of flavonoids and flavone glycosides. Present work provides the first scientific report on phytoconstituents of J. tanjorensis and its ethnopharmacological significance.},

abstract={This paper presents laboratory investigations on the use of ultra fine ground granulated blast furnace slag (UFGGBFS) as a mineral admixture in concrete and cement mortar cubes. Ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) is available in plenty as a waste product resulting from steel industries and posing disposal problems subsequently leading to environmental problems. GGBFS obtained in the present work was subjected to grinding for two hours using agate pestle mortar and the effect of grinding on size was monitored by testing particle size with the help of a particle size analyzer, where reduction in size was observed. The sample was later used as a partial substitute to cement. A high strength concrete mix with a characteristic compressive strength of 40 MPa was selected for the present study, and cement was replaced with UFGGBFS in three different percentages; namely 3, 5 and 7%. Compressive strength of mortar and strength and sorptivity characteristics of concrete made with UFGGBFS were studied. Test results showed that replacement of cement with 5% UFGGBFS yielded better resistance to compression and sorption in normal and aggressive environments compared to control specimens. © 2014 JUST.

The density of states (DOS) reveals that the donor level was increased with increase of oxygen vacancy in the super cell. The band structure analysis shows that the removal of oxygen or oxygen defect in the super cell tends to decrease the band gap. The optical absorption coefficient values of super cell decreases with the increase of oxygen vacancies.

abstract={Precise estimation of Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) and maximum rate of reaction (Vmax) is very significant in studying enzyme inhibition as well as the catalytic efficiency of the immobilized enzyme in electrochemical nanointerface based biosensors. Generally linear regression models such as Lineweaver-Burk plot, Eadie-Hosftee plot, Eadie-Scatchard plot and Hanes-Woolf plot have been used to estimate enzyme kinetic parameters. But, the disadvantage of using linear regression plots is changing error statistics. As an alternative to linear regression models, three nonlinear regression models namely Gauss Newton plot, Chi Square plot and Levenberg-Marquardt fit (LVM) have been used, which fits the data by successive iterations. In this work, a sample data of lactate detecting electrochemical biosensor (Au/Nano-ZnO/LDH) has been considered for the precise estimation of Kmand Vmaxby employing nonlinear mathematical tools. Finally regression, residual, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, Chi Square, residual sum of squares and percent average relative error analyses are carried out on the adapted nonlinear mathematical models to choose optimized Michaelis-Menten equation.

Among a total of 5 strains isolated from the marine sponge (Tedania anhelans), 2 strains (40%) were found to produce bacteriocins against the aquaculture pathogenic Vibrios. The highest bacteriocin production activity was shown by two strains, namely S3 (Bacillus thuringiensis) and S4 (Bacillus subtilis). The antimicrobial activity of crude bacteriocin extracts from these strains was inactivated when treated with proteinase K and Trypsin. The growth curve and the bacteriocin production during different phases were studied. The bacteriocins produced by the isolates were partially purified by acetone precipitation. These substances were heat-sensitive and stable at a wide range of pH 3-5. This study explores the possibilty of marine bacteriocins as probiotics for sustainable aquaculture and for the biocontrol of Vibrios in particular. © 2014, Sphinx Knowledge House.

abstract={With the advancement of technology and networking techniques, it is possible to transmit images at a lower bit r a t e and at the same time with high security. In order to fulfil the security needs of image transmission, several encryption, decryption and image encoding techniques have been put forward. The encryption discussed in this study is the PN (Pseudo Random Number) sequence based encryption using Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) algorithm. In the proposed method, initially the image is portioned into blocks. Run length encoding is done for the level shifted image. Then Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and quantization was done and Difference of Quantized DC (DQDC) was calculated. Then the quantized blocks are shuffled based on the PN sequence and then the scrambled images are arranged in zigzag order. Then finally run length and Huffman lossless compression are done to eliminate the additional bits generated using PN codes. Metrics like correlation coefficient, Unified Average Changing Intensity (UACI), Number of Pixels Change Rate (NPCR) were computed to prove the sternness of the proposed method. © 2014 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

abstract={The increased intimidation in pilfering copyrighted multimedia files demands the imprint of ownership identity called fingerprint in video/audio files.

Several hiding methods using image, audio, video or text as cover media have been found in literature with software based implementations like MATLAB. Some of these have also been reported in hardware platforms like FPGAs. As a trade-off between these implementations, embedded devices such as ARM core were used for image steganography on gray images to embed less payload in an attempt to abide the resource constrains on embedded devices. This study suggests an indicator based random LSB coding method that embeds fingerprint on a WAV audio file. The implementation was carried out on an embedded device LPC2148 with ARM7 core housed on MCB2140 evaluation board that supports audio play through on board amplifier and speaker.

abstract={Highly selective strong turn-on fluorescence for Mg2+(Φ = 0.03 to 0.57) was realized with a simple Salen based Schiff base chemosensor (1a) using dimethylformamide (DMF) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as solvent. Importantly, Ca2+that often interferes in the Mg2+fluorescence sensing did not show any significant influence on the selectivity. The fluorescence sensing of Mg2+is highly solvent as well as amine structure dependent. Fluorescence sensing of Mg2+only by 1,2-phenylenediamine condensed Schiff bases in DMF or DMSO was observed. Different substituents (1b-e) on the salicylaldehyde unit were synthesized and we explored the effect of substitution on Mg2+sensing and selectivity. Except 1c, other chemosensors showed selective fluorescence sensing of Mg2+in DMF/DMSO. Interestingly, 1a-e (except 1c) exhibited selective strong turn-on fluorescence for Fe3+(λmax= 462 nm, Φ = 0.421) in different solvents (DMSO, DMF, THF, CH3CN) after 1 h. The concentration dependent studies showed linear enhancement of fluorescence intensity for Mg2+with the detection limit of 10-7M. The practical applications of the chemosensor for selective sensing of Mg2+in real samples such as pond, tap, river and ground water have also been demonstrated.

abstract={Ayurveda is an ancient holistic healing system, which is nearly 5000 years old that uses natural herbal leaves to heal various diseases. Herbal leaves have been widely utilized by the industries like food, medical and cosmetic. But most of the herbal plants are endangered. So, there is a need to identify and regrow them for the use of future generations. So it is very indispensable to develop an automatic system to identify species correctly. This paper proposes an algorithm for recognition of herb leaf through image processing and classification technique using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) method is used for the feature extraction in leaves. The work is carried out using 5 species of leaves in MATLAB environment. SVM classifier is trained with 273 samples and tested with 129 samples of herbal and non-herbal leaves are presented in this paper. The output showed that the system reached the recognition rate with 92.25% accuracy. The system is convenient to use and cost effective for the botanist, Scientist and Researcher to identify herbal leaves.},

abstract={Introduction: Cynodon dactylon and Gmelina asiatica plants are used since ages in ayurveda and siddha systems of medicine for treating various ailments. In the present paper, phytochemical analysis of these plant sources and their antioxidant and nephroprotective efficacy studies carried out through in vitro, method are presented and discussed. The phytochemical analysis of aqueous extracts of these plants revealed the presence of high concentration of secondary metabolites such as phenolic acids, flavonoids, and proanthocyanidin, which were determined using gallic acid and quercetin as standards.
Materials and Methods: Antioxidant activity of each extract was evaluated using in vitro assays such as (1, 1-diphenyl picrylhyrazyl) radical scavenging assay, reducing power assay, nitric oxide scavenging activity, superoxide scavenging activity, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide assay, lipid peroxidation assay and thiobarbituric assay. In vitro anti-inflammatory plant drugs were evaluated using in vitro methods like inhibition of protein denaturation, membrane stabilization assay and proteinase inhibitory assay. Acetyl salicylic acid and butyl hydroxyl toluene were used as standard for anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant assays, respectively.
Results: Selected plants have shown potent protective activity against free radical which is evident through data obtained in various antioxidant assays. All the extracts tested revealed a protective effect on red blood cells against heat induced membrane damage and proteinase inhibition, which depicted its vital role in maintaining the integrity of the cell membrane. The promising results obtained through in vitro anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory assay prompted us to evaluate nephroprotective potential of these plants using DNA fragmentation assay, epifluorescence assay and cytoprotective assay. Normal kidney cells (vero cells) were used for epiflourescence dual staining and DNA fragmentation assay using vitamin E as a positive control.
Conclusion: The data of the results obtained suggested that the selected plants can contribute in the development of human friendly antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and nephroprotective agent. Attempts were also made to understand the propable mechanism of action through in silico approaches. © 2014 Asian Journal of Pharmaceutical and Clinical Research. All rights reserved.},

Our experiments show that during the preparation of an iron-based herbometallic drug, transition from Fe3O4/γ-Fe2O3to α-Fe2O3is delayed to higher temperatures due to addition of light metals from the aqueous extracts of Indian gooseberry, Belleric myrobalans and Chebulic myrobalans.

abstract={Infections are caused by several microorganisms, which are mostly affecting the mucosal surfaces such as gastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract, vaginal tract etc. These microorganisms are treated with anti-infective drugs based on their severity of action in the individuals. The conventional anti-infectives have short residence time at the site of application and poor bioavailability, which leads to incomplete elimination of organisms causing reoccurance and tolerance. Recently, vesicular mode of delivery of drugs has gained attraction because of its improved therapeutic efficacy and stability. Vesicles are bilayered structures formed by hydration of lipid molecules and can be used for incorporating both hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs. This paper focus on various vesicular systems such as liposomes, niosomes, ethosomes, transferosomes and their contribution towards overcoming the disadvantages of anti-infective drugs.},

abstract={Understanding structural excursions of proteins under native conditions at residue level resolutions is crucial to map energy landscapes of proteins and also to solve the 'Levinthal paradox' of protein folding. Native-state hydrogen-deuterium (NS H/D) exchange methods are powerful to structurally characterize cryptic intermediates (CIs) populating sparsely in the unfolding kinetics of proteins under conditions favoring folded conformations of the proteins. However, the methods are not applicable to proteins that are susceptible to denaturation or degradation or aggregation in the course of exchange experiments and also to proteins that are smaller in size (&lt;10 kDa) in general. We have herein demonstrated a novel computational tool, OneG-Vali, which predicts the possible existence of cryptic intermediates of proteins in a qualitative and quantitative manner. And, the tool validates the prediction efficiency by comparing multistate unfolding curves defined by the tool with pseudo two-state unfolding curves of the proteins determined by macroscopic methods. In addition, the OneG-Vali facilitates accounting for the effect of cis-trans proline isomerization on estimating the population of CIs defined by the tool and also by experimental methods. The prediction accuracy of the tool is validated using proteins such as cytochrome c, apocytochrome b562, the third domain of PDZ and T4 lysozyme. The OneG-Vali is implemented using CGI-Perl and it can be freely accessed and instantly used at http://sblab.sastra.edu/oneg-vali.html. This journal is © the Partner Organisations 2014.},

abstract={Engineered nanoparticles that can facilitate drug formulation and passively target tumours have been under extensive research in recent years. These successes have driven a new wave of significant innovation in the generation of advanced particles. The fate and transport of diagnostic nanoparticles would significantly depend on nonselective drug delivery, and hence the use of high drug dosage is implemented. In this perspective, nanocarrier-based drug targeting strategies can be used which improve the selective delivery of drugs to the site of action, i.e. drug targeting. Pharmaceutical industries majorly focus on reducing the toxicity and side effects of drugs but only recently it has been realised that carrier systems themselves may pose risks to the patient. Proteins are compatible with biological systems and they are biodegradable. They offer a multitude of moieties for modifications to tailor drug binding, imaging or targeting entities. Thus, protein nanoparticles provide outstanding contributions as a carrier for drug delivery systems. This review summarises recent progress in particle-based therapeutic delivery and discusses important concepts in particle design and biological barriers for developing the next generation of particles drug delivery systems. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={The influence of precursor medium was investigated on the structural, morphological, optical and electrical properties of spray pyrolysis deposited nanostructured ZnO thin films. Three batches of ZnO thin films were deposited on glass substrates using three different solvents (water, water-ethanol [ratio of 1:1] and ethanol) based precursor solution of zinc nitrate hexahydrate. The substrate temperature was fixed at 523 K. The variation in film thickness from 150 to 875 nm was observed as the effect of changing solvent medium. X-ray diffraction (XRD) data confirmed the formation of polycrystalline ZnO thin films with hexagonal wurtzite crystallite structure and the estimated crystallite size was found to be ranging from 31 to 55 nm. Scanning electron micrographs revealed the formation of water-hyacinth shaped nanostructures when water-ethanol mixture was used as the solvent medium. Interestingly, UV-vis spectrophotometer revealed the formation of ZnO film with twin optical band gap of 3.15 eV and 3.56 eV when ethanol was used as the solvent medium. The modulation of film thickness and grain size by solvent medium has strongly influenced the electrical conductivity of ZnO thin films.

abstract={The aim of this paper is to propose works by analysing, the data sent from the admin through Wi-Fi and provides acknowledgement to the admin through the same system used for communication. The reason why Wi-Fi has been,used for broad-casting the data is that today's conventional educational institutions have Wi-Fi facility in their campus for providing internet connectivity to the students. Broad-casting is done by sending the data to all the access points by accessing the broadcast ID of the network in which this system is to be implemented. Hence the same Wi-Fi system can be used to broadcast the message from administrator to classrooms and vice-versa. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Quality improvement is a highly vital objective for the intensely competitive global business. During the past, Indian firms have been subjected to the clarion call that the quality of products and services need to be improved to match the level of their superior counterparts in foreign countries. The shift of manager's role in 21st century provides the context of the quality challenges faced by graduate schools in management. There are several challenges of management education faces which require change in the character and structure of management education, integration of management education with corporate sector, up gradation of curriculum and course content, designing of different programs for executives, emphasis on research and consultancy. There is a huge gap between the vision and the strategy of management education institutions. The Balanced Score Card is a synergy tool that links vision and strategy to everyday action by translating the strategy in to strategic priorities and initiatives, relating these to clear tangible strategic outcomes and have to strive for: satisfied stakeholders, delighted customers, efficient and effective processes and motivated workforce. This study seeks to represent a framework for management education institutions in Madurai city using the four perspectives of Balanced Scorecard approach that can be used to identify critical success factors, possible measures for performance objectives and recommend strategies for realizing vision. © Maxwell Scientific Organization, 2014.},

abstract={This study presents a survey of information retrieval and its various methodologies. In today's escalating world, tracking of information should be done with ease. Keeping that as a constraint, most of the qualms can be deciphered with the aid of Machine Learning (ML). ML can be envisioned as a tool, which identifies and disseminates all information through computerized systems, which can be integrated in the respective domains, in order to get a better and more proficient retrieval of content. This study summarizes the well-known methods used in feature extraction and for classification of text. ML can be portrayed as a major tracker for surveillance, with the aid of some trained ML algorithms. In order to strengthen the response policies for any queries, which is being surrounded with two main issues like policy matching and policy administration, can be prevailed over Joint Threshold Administration Model, JTAM (i.e., Principle of separation of duty). This study gives an overall review about tracking of information with respective to semantic as well as syntactic perspective. It revolves around some of the application as well as administrative mechanism involved in Information Retrieval for mining the data. Data mining techniques in various arenas has been explored; this survey explores the various techniques and evolution of mining in detail.© Maxwell Scientific Organization, 2014.},

abstract={The main objective of this paper is to design and develop an assistive leg for the paralyzed patients, which supports them, by changing their paralyzed gait pattern to normal gait pattern. The normal gait pattern is achieved by reflex action. Two angle measurement sensors are mounted in the normal leg and two servo motors are mounted in the paralytic leg-at the hip and ankle. The principle is that as the person takes a step in his normal leg, the sensors detect the amount of leg movement and sent the data to microcontroller. Then the servo motors in the paralytic leg are actuated based on the commands from the microcontroller depending on the type of gait suitable for the person. It is observed in such patients that they follow three kinds of gait. Depending on the amount of normal leg movement the gait pattern is decided and the servo motors rotate to move the paralytic leg. During all these, the person still takes the help from the walking aid. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

The power flow solution of the proposed radial distribution network with different types of load models is obtained using Backward/forward sweep based load flow methodology. The sensitive nodes which are prone to voltage collapse are identified by the computation of voltage stability index for the installation of shunt capacitors. A nature inspired meta-heuristic search technique namely artificial bee colony algorithm which mimics the foraging behavior of the honey bee swarm is utilized to identify the optimal size of the shunt capacitors to be placed to achieve the loss minimization. The rigidness of the proposed optimization approach searching towards the optimal solution is tested on IEEE 69 bus radial test distribution system with different load models such as constant power, constant current, constant impedance, composite and exponential loads. © 2006-2014 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).},

abstract={Equal Channel Angular Pressing is a severe plastic deformation technique to produce Ultra Fine Grain (UFG) microstructure in bulk materials. The strain induced due to the severe plastic deformation depends mainly upon the channel angle and the processing route followed. Various dies with different channel angle are modeled and analyzed through DEFORM 3D. The strain imparted and the load required for different channel angles and different processing routes are determined from the analysis results. The results are compared and the optimum channel angle is determined. ©(2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Natural disaster like landslides mostly seen in a fragile mountain hill slopes like Himalayas in North India, Western ghats in Kerala and Karnataka, The Nilgiris, Annamalai hills, Megamalai in Tamil Nadu, etc. Anthropogenic activities like improper planning, networking, deforestation and agricultural activities are one of the important factors in hilly regions and aggravated the slope instability. Normally, wherever, slides are occurs the slope is converted to gentle slope and it is stable in condition. In this condition, due to external factors like rainfall, manmade activities are further stressed and causing recurrence of slope instability in an already slide slopes. In this regard, to assess the stability condition of slide area, which seen in recent past near human settlement are taken to detailed study. The present study area, in Lovedale, The Nilgiris one of the connecting roads from NH 67 to Lovedale village have been obtained considering stress condition due to heavy urban development's (mainly resorts) in this ghat section. In Ooty municipality, 25 slides are occurred in 2009 rainfall, out of 25 slides five slides are present in this ghat section and one of the slide points near Lovedale Club was selected in detailed study. Due to this slide, the club building is damaged and middle slope NMR railway was also blocked by debris. The field investigation noticed that 3 tensional cracks present in the upper slope near club building. It is clearly documented through photographs. The slope was divided into three zones as upper, middle and lower slope and slope stability analysis was carried out. To fulfilling the study, nine surface soil samples and three core samples were collected in upper, middle and lower slopes and found out 'c' and 'φ' values using Direct Shear Test. The factor of safety was calculated by using Limit Equilibrium method. As per the analysis, factor of safety was calculated in three static conditions as dry, partial saturated and complete saturated condition. The results indicated that upper slopes FOS is 0.98, 0.84, 0.70 as dry, partial and complete saturated conditions, middle slope is 1.37, 1.09, 0.80 and lower slopes is 1.32, 1.05, 0.77 for same conditions respectively. The results are verified with CFC method. The slide area is very critical in condition whenever heavy precipitation is present and the slope may be failed. The results are informed to local administrative agencies and recommended to prevent the slope using any one of the slope production measures. © 2014 CAFET-INNOVA TECHNICAL SOCIETY.},

abstract={Biodegradable polymers have been extensively used as scaffolds to regenerate lost tissues. The geometry of the three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds has an influence on the cellular behaviour. In this study, we have developed 3D-scaffolds of axially aligned nanofibres of poly(lactic acid) (PLA), poly(caprolactone) (PCL) and PLA:CL (50:50) with diameters in the range 100-400 nm, internal diameter 4 mm, length 4 cm and wall thickness 0.2 mm, by using a dynamic collector. PCL and PLA:CL nanofibres were significantly less hydrophobic than PLA nanofibres. The porosity of PCL (16.23±9.88%) and PLA:CL nanofibres (14.77±3.41%) were comparable, while PLA (6.57±1.54%) nanofibres had lower porosity. The tensile strength and Young's modulus of PLA was significantly lower than PCL and PLA:CL nanofibres and the suture retention strengths of all three scaffolds were comparable. After 4 weeks, the molecular weight of PLA nanofibres was reduced by 53% compared to 44% and 41% for PCL and the PLA:CL nanofibres, respectively. However, the PLA:CL nanofibres maintained their structural integrity even after 28 days. Platelet adhesion studies showed that PCL nanofibres had least tendency to be thrombogenic, while PLA:CL blend nanofibres were highly thrombogenic. Further, in vitro responses such as cell adhesion, proliferation and gene expression of human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) were evaluated. After 6 days of culture, the surfaces of all the three scaffolds were completely covered with cells. Our results demonstrate that expression levels of elastin, angiopoietin, laminin-4α and -5α were upregulated in PCL and PLA:CL nanofibres without the addition of any exogenous factors. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Aluminum alloys are mostly used for high strength structural applications utilized in aircraft structure, trucks body, military vehicles, bridges and weapons manufacture. Conventional fusion welding of aluminum alloy produces porosity and hot cracks in the welded joint due to incorrect selection of consumables and parameters, which may lead to lower weld toughness and defects in the mechanical properties. The mostly adopted method for welding AA 2014-T6 is solid state joining process. Friction stir welding (FSW) is an emerging solid state of joining process which avoids bulk melting of the basic material, hot cracking and porosity. The welding parameters and tool pin profile play a major role in deciding weld quality. In this investigation, an attempt has been made to understand the various influences of tool rotational speed, welding speed and pin profile of the tool on friction stir processed (FSP) zone formation in joining of AA2014 aluminum alloy. High Carbon High Chromium steel tool of plain cylindrical pin profile is used to fabricate the joints. The average grey relation grade for each level of each factor are calculated and it was found that the optimal settings of the levels of factors Tool rotation speed (A), Weld speed (B) and Tilt angle (C) are A1-B3-C3.

In the present work, a fixed volume of single water droplet is made to impinge on a horizontal Aluminium surface using a designed microcontroller based syringe pump. The formation and the dynamics of bubbles are recorded using a high speed camera. Image processing technique is used to determine the droplet parameters such as contact angle, spreading radius and to study the shape of the droplet. The surface temperature is measured using a Thermocouple connected to an online Data acquisition system. The effect of the characteristics of droplet on the decrease in surface temperature can be seen from the temperature - time graph and the processed photographs taken using high speed camera.

abstract={Statins are mainly used as the inhibitors of enzyme 3-hydroxy-3 methyl glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG COA) reductase which is responsible for the synthesis of cholesterol. Apart from the cholesterol reducing activity they also facilitate as antiinflammatory and cardio-protective agents. Solubility is one of the main parameter for any drug to achieve the expected therapeutic effects. Since Simvastatin is poorly soluble drug with less half life of about 2 hours, various types of formulations are being currently prepared to enhance its solubility which in turn may improve the bioavailability of the drug. Studies reveal that different methodologies were carried out to overcome the bioavailability issue which is the key limiting factor. The present study focuses on the different types of novel formulation approaches of Simvastatin, currently available for enhancing the bioavailability and efficacy of the drug in the biological system.},

abstract={Vaginitis is mostly caused by Trichomonas vaginalis leading to mild to severe infections in the vaginal mucosa. The treatment for this disease can be initiated with the help of antimicrobial and antifungal agents in various dosage forms. Novel dosage forms have gained prior significance in recent formulation researches due to their inevitable controlled drug release mechanism and site specific applications. These systems include nanoparticles, micro particles, hydrogel systems, mucoadhesive systems, In-situ gels, etc. The physicochemical and biopharmaceutical parameters of the drug greatly influence the selection of the dosage form design. The attempt of this review is to enlighten the various novel approaches adopted for the design of antimicrobial and antifungal agents, such as Secnidazole, Fluconazole, Metronidazole, etc., with special emphasis on the treatment of vaginitis. Development of novel dosage forms of these antimicrobial agents would be a suitable way to achieve better therapeutic result against vaginitis.},

abstract={Protein folding is a spontaneous self-assembly process, which occurs in the biological system. Understanding this complex process not only helps in deciphering the mechanism involved in protein misfolding diseases but also helps in modeling in vitroand in vivosystems for testing the therapeutic strategies developed for the disease. Among the protein misfolding diseases, much emphasis has been given to Alzheimer's disease because of its prevalence among elderly individuals and propensity to cause external damage to neurons, an effective cure for which is yet to be designed. Though amyloid fibrils are the major cause of neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease, their mechanism of self-assembly during pathological conditions is still under active investigation. This review aims to understand the basic mechanism of amyloid fibril formation and how it can be characterized in different stages by various techniques. With this information, it is possible to design both in vitroand in vivosystems, which not only serves as model systems for understanding the mechanism of amyloid fibril formation but also helps to test new therapeutic strategies against the disease. This review also highlights the pros and cons of currently available in vitroand in vivosystems, which can aid the readers to select a suitable system for their further studies. © 2014 Bentham Science Publishers.},

The objective was to produce the 2% salicylic acid emollient gel formulation for the immediate release of drug thereby reducing the side effects in psoriasis treatment. The best formulation of plain SA gel was optimized through different evaluation studies and the effect of emu oil as emollient in the enhancement of penetration and release mechanism of SA through skin from emollient gel of optimized formulation were evaluated using in vitro and ex vivo diffusion studies. 100% of drug release was obtained at the end of 2nd h which confirms the immediate release of SA from emollient gel. Around 76% of drug was permeated through skin and 14.95% of drug could entrap inside the skin which revealed the impact of emollient in the permeation of drug. 2% SA emollient gel formulation was effective to provide immediate release of SA and could reduce the side effects on the skin by permeating all drug components through skin and so it could be consider as a best choice for the treatment of psoriasis.},

abstract={Objective: Therapeutic formulation to reduce amyloid beta (Aβ) insult in neuronal cells remains an important focus in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. To combat the multifactorial threats that arise during amyloid plaque formation, multi-dimensional approach is required. Methods: Peptide sequence KLVFF derived from the core recognition motif of Aβ1-42 can bind to the plaques and help to reduce further accumulation. In our previous work, we have reported various self-assembling structures of KLVFF along with its surface tension lowering ability to overcome the cytotoxicity caused by Aβ1-42. In the present work, we have developed a novel combination of peptide-curcumin- loaded liposomal formulation and characterized for its morphology, protein adsorption and colloidal stability. The therapeutic efficacy of the formulation was tested using a cholinergic neuronal cell line pre-treated with Aβ1-42. Results: The physiochemical characterization and in vitro efficacy of peptide-curcumin-loaded liposomal formulation were found to outperform well in bringing down the amyloid toxicity. Conclusion: This cumulative evidence indicates that the nanocarrier-based alternative treatment stratagem is an effective way to treat Alzheimer's disease. © 2014 Informa UK, Ltd.},

abstract={The term 'Cryptography' refers to the art of converting secret content to an unreadable form and the intermediate content holds the theme of the communication. In the era of electronic commerce, the process of safeguarding the secret content is too complicated. The procedure of storing the secret in an image is done through 'Steganography', which helps to protect the data from snoopers. The secret content is forwarded to a cryptic mechanism to generate the cipher text and the 'Key' plays the major role in the process of generating ciphers from plain text. The projected work deals with a Chess game based Bishop Tour logic to store the 'Key' in image, which is then transmitted over the channel. Existing approaches focused only on the stego based procedures to store the content on images, but the work focuses on both the crypto and stego techniques to transmit a 'Key' over the channel. The content embedding procedure can be done by following LSB substitution scheme, the proposed scheme adaptively imbeds the secret code into input image and the results show that the system offers more protection for embedding content in a high quality image. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Pullulan, a microbial exopolysaccharide was produced by submerged fermentation of palm kernel hydrolysate. Besides pullulan, Aureobasidium pullulans synthesized some enzymes and they interfered with product purity. Pullulan was separated from the fermentation broth by sequential steps, involving heat treatment to denature enzymes and solvent precipitation to recover the product. Fermentation broth was centrifuged at 8000rpm for 15 min to harvest the cells. Supernatant was heated to 120 °C for 60 min and added with three volumes of isopropanol. Pure pullulan was obtained after precipitation time of 10hrs at 4 °C.},

abstract={"Knowledge" is the important success component of this century for any individual, organization or a country. The twentieth century and the industrial revolution considered the machines and materials as immense assets; in the fast-growing global economy, the knowledge is considered as the vital asset for growth, sustenance and survival.There are conventional ways of acquiring the knowledge; a classic example is the traditional class room training where the instructor and the students meet in a specific physical place for the purpose of teaching and learning. As the binary driven world emerges with the invention of computers and micro processor enabled devices in the twenty first century, the entire paradigm of training and learning has been transforming into a new era the electronic learning, usually denoted as virtual learning or eLearning Any mode of learning either through traditional class room training or through eLearning the training and learning can be considered as successful only when the following two important goals are met. First and foremost, the learning has to be completed on time, and the second is, the intended knowledge should be acquired with required degree. This paper discusses specifically in the context of eLearning - the vital parameters such as - duration of the course, delivery methodology of the training, organizational support climate, complexity of the training availability of the real-time support during the course that are influences the successful completion in eLearning. An empirical study has been done in an IT organization that offers almost all the training methodologies as the medium of training to their employees such as traditional class room training, virtual training and blended training. © Research India Publications.},

Although synthetic fibre reinforced composite possess high specific strength, their fields of application are very limited because of their higher cost of production. In recent years, there has been much interest in the natural fibres than synthetic fibres, motivated by potential advantages of weight saving, lower raw material price and ecological advantages of using renewable resources. This study mainly concentrates on hybrid fibres like sisal and coir fibre by varying the percentage of fibres in weight fraction. Hybridization of fibres are used in this study due to their combined effect on the strength related characteristics of concrete.

Compared to the conventional 3-DOF RRR planar parallel mechanism in which all the links lie on a single plane which makes the links vulnerable to cantilever action during vertical loading, the new design has the links elevated and non-planar legs are constructed. This overcomes the drawback of cantilever nature of links and is also found to have better stiffness and optimized workspace at lesser mass than the conventional manipulator. Based on this concept, the working model of the manipulator is constructed and the manipulator is serially controlled using MATLAB software and 8051 micro-controller board through a MATLAB GUI developed for this project. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={New trend to meet the increasing power demand is to enforce series compensated line. Due to the addition of capacitors, there will be change in the impedance. Thereby, the distance relay working based on the impedance value is affected. The power swings due to disturbances in power system causes the voltages and currents to swing in amplitude and phase angle in different parts of the networks. The impedance measured based on these parameters also oscillates. If these impedance become very small and enter the mho relay zone, it could lead to an undesired tripping of the distance relay. The behaviour of these power swings are different for the series compensated line when compared to the uncompensated line as everything is majorly based on impedance. Through this model the mho characteristics and the operation of relay of a series compensated and uncompensated line during fault and power swing is investigated in-depth. PSCAD-EMTDC software serves as a platform to implement the objective of this project. © Research India Publications.},

Submerged fermentation turned out to be favourable. Yeast fermentation was employed simultaneously with the saccharification process (SSF) for 72 hours. An attempt was made to produce ethanol from Potato peel waste, however it proved corn as an efficient substrate. There was a considerable yield of ethanol of 15.88g/l using pH 5.5, an intermediate particle size of 0.157mm and at a substrate concentration of 10% (W/V).

As per the available statistics provided by the World Health Organization, an estimate of more than 1. 2 million people are killed in road accidents every year and about 50 million are injured. The main reasons for this alarming number of accident victims are due to the negligence of following road rules, rash driving and vehicle defects. Here we propose a wireless accident sensing system which can detect the accident location in real time to save accident victims. This information is made available by using onboard vehicle sensors like accelerometer, flex sensors, gyroscope along with temperature and gas sensors. To reduce the amount of false information, information from smart phone sensors inside the vehicle are also factored. The location information is available through GPS. Participatory sensing methods are also taken into account to further increase the credibility of accident occurrences information. With all these information, we deploy an adaptive algorithm to perform context analysis, inference and context aware accident initiation. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Now-a-days integral bridges are becoming famous among the construction of bridges over worldwide. Integral bridges are given importance in bridge construction due to its structural integrity and its performance towards seismic activities compared to that of conventional type of bridges. This study is based on two different types of integral bridges such as Box Girder bridge and TGirder bridge. Performances of bridges are checked for IRC class loading and seismic activities are predicted. Thus arrived results are compared and from that the best option of bridge in integral bridge is chosen. Similarly two different finite element software's such as SAP2000 and ANSYS are used to analyze both integral bridges. From the analysis, software which gives better results was also predicted. In this study Box Girder bridge was found as the best option among Box Girder and T-Girder integral bridges. Since the bending moment created for Box Girder bridge was lesser when compared to the bending moment created for T-Girder bridge. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Outage consummations are examined for (STBC) (Space-Time Block Coded) multiband OHWDM (ORTHOGONALLY DISTRIBUTED HAAR WAVELET DIVISION MULTIPLEXING) UWB (Ultra Wide Band) STBC Multiband-OHWDM UWB using discrete wavelet transform (DWT). Since the model of the channel used contemplates the normal-log shadowing, the (SNR) of this is a subsequent to Rayleigh's distribution. Using the above, we determine Error rates in bits (BER). Also, design of STBC Multi Band- OHWDM UWB systems, with two transmitting terminal heads and one or more than one receiving terminal heads using DWT and FFT are used for attaining one Gigabits/sec rate data. Here we do investigate the consummation of these systems with various models of the channel. The Bit Error Rate and its performing spectrum with the different modeling systems are occurred by using the domain based on frequency realistic processing and those results are compared to those of one terminal headed transmitting systems. From the processed outputs, it is evident that the STBC Multiple Band-OHWDM Ultra Wide Band system provides significant gains for the data rate of 1 Gigabits/sec transmission over single terminal head Multi Band-OHWDM UWB systems. We present that, BER consummation of STBC Multi Band- OHWDM UWB system is the multiple of the count of transmitting terminal heads and the count of receiving terminal heads, the total count of many paths components, and the total count of jointly encoded OHWDM symbols. The interesting thing is the diversification gain does not depend severely on the fading parameter. Also, the diversification advantage collected using Rayleigh's fading with an arbitrary parameter is approximately same as that collected under Rayleigh fading channels. We conclude that from the Processed outputs it is evident that, the STBC Multi Band-OHWDM UWB systems with DWT will provide more convincing gains for data rate of 1 Gigabits/sec transmission over Multi band-OHWDM UWB systems using conventional method with FFT. © Research India Publications.},

Embracing myriad techniques that the researchers have come up recently content based image retrieval has grabbed a constant interest and demand due to their simplicity. In spite of the exponential increase in the usage of query based image retrieval scheme [16], the direct extension to this scheme will be insufficient, as we know the leaves of same plant have varying botanical morphometry. In this paper, the proposed query or CBIR scheme scheme uses the extraction of features such as color and texture from the given input image [11]. Initially image decomposition is carried out using Haar transform, fnorm based feature extraction and color feature extraction using color moments are the basic workflow. It carries out precise leaf classification. The aim of the paper is to reduce the complexity using FNorm theory, Haar transform with the no compromise in performance of the CBIR scheme. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Industrial monitoring is the one of the most important roles of the real time features. Generally the industrial monitoring has two ways of the monitoring techniques. They are indoor industrial monitoring and outdoor industrial monitoring. Anoutdoor industrial monitoring has the SWE (sensor web enablement) technology, by the use of this technology outdoor environment of the industry was successfully monitored. But, an indoor industrial monitoring does not has the SWE technology. There are some difficulties to apply this method for monitoring the indoor industrial environment. The SWE technology has the GIS (Geographic Information System) application. This application is not suitable for indoor environment. Because it is luxurious to set up an indoor location system as it normally requires huge apparatus and dispensation power, depending on the size of the factory and essential accuracy. To overcome these problems this proposed system is developed. This proposed system has the two units namely, processing unit and monitoring unit. A processing unit is used to sense the ranges of the sensors an indoor industry. A monitoring unit is used to monitor the indoor environments through the PC.

Our work in this project is to reduce Bit Error ratio. In many applications, it is very important to retrieve the same binary image that has been transmitted. For this purpose, the input image which will be in the form of matrix (of m × n rows and columns), is first converted to a row vector. It is then encoded (encrypted), modulated with various modulation techniques and is transmitted over fading channel. The reverse process is done at the receiver. The encoding and decoding is performed with our secret test sequence. The increase in visual quality of received images which is reconstructed using our decoding technique is witnessed using MATLAB simulation results. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Wireless Embedded Network that combines embedded systems and wireless communication is an emerging technology. It is widely used in industrial based control and automation where specific communication is established using embedded hardware. In this paper, the real time issues in embedded processor for device to device communication, embedded device with wireless transceivers, data communication through wireless transceivers and measurement of energy level of run time embedded node are considered. Embedded node consists of ARM7: LPC 2148 processor and Xbee wireless interface transceivers. The simple node to node communication is established using multiple LPC 2148 and LPC 2129 nodes. In this work, the processed data is communicated using broadcast, hob by hop and tree based structure through wireless transceiver to other embedded devices is performed. The individual embedded node energy level is measured at run time for identify the alive nodes in the network. The optimal routes among the embedded nodes are identified using individual node energy level. Hence unwanted data transaction is minimized. In this proposed prototype LPC 2148 processor with sensing units and multiple wireless transceivers are used to validate the optimal network resources for embedded networking. This work provides the essential support to develop and establish an embedded networking with low cost, tiny embedded processors. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={The Self Compacting Concrete (SCC) is a high performance concrete because of its special features like flowing ability, passing ability and filling ability. In a multi-storeyed building construction, to erect the floors of different elevations the pump-ability of concrete is a major concern as well as compaction by vibrators. To overcome the above two aspects of lifting of concrete and compaction of concrete one has to choose a concrete having property of fluidity and self compactibility, i.e. Self Compacting Concrete (SCC). The mix proportions should be prepared in such a way that the coarse aggregate participation in volume should be reduced and the fine aggregate in the powder form is to be increased. In present work, cement is a permanent agent, the replacement of fine aggregate by Quarry Dust (QD) in percentages namely(20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100%) and Brick Dust (BD) in percentages namely (10%, 20%, 30%, 40% and 50%) with W/C ratio of 0.40 the study on fresh properties of SCC; Compressive strength and split tensile strength of SCC were made. The chemical admixtures namely Super plasticizer (SP) is added by considering 3% weight of cement and Stabilizer VMA is added with 0.1% by weight of cement. From the experimental investigation, it was found that the replacement of Fine Aggregate (FA) by 20% Quarry Dust (QD) and 10% Brick Dust (BD) gives maximum compressive strength and split tensile strength respectively. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={There are several systems in the world which are mostly non-linear. There is very minimum chance of finding a linear system. The quadruple or four tank system that follows the law of mass balance and energy equations is a non-linear process. Due to noise perturbation it is more difficult to measure the water level in the quadruple tank process system. Here estimation plays the vital role to estimate the real time state variable. If the state variable is accurately estimated it is very easy to maintain the level in system. This work describes about the estimator called Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). State estimation is done by Extended Kalman filter to determine the state variable of the process. By using the estimated state variables the complexity of the system gets reduced. Thereby the desired outcome from the system will be attained in a smooth manner. Then MPC and PID controller has been designed and compared for efficient control operation. © Research India Publications.},

The data was collected after calibrating each tank. To design the neural network controller for nonlinear interacting tank systems the Internal model control (IMC)with neural network model is used. The process is non linear because the two tanks are interacting each other. Finally, the neural network controller is compared with Proportional-integral and derivative controller (PID) and IMC controllers. The neural network controller out performs the conventional controllers like PID and IMC.

abstract={Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) has achieved worldwide attention in the current years. There are several applications for civilian purposes such as traffic monitoring, surveillance, etc. Nodes are deployed randomly in the network. The major limitations of randomly deployed nodes in WSN are energy consumption and network lifetime. Hence the lifetime limitation on randomly deployed wireless sensor nodes need to be addressed and this could be resolved through energy efficient clustering. The effective formation of clustering is one of the interesting problems in sensor network. The proposed work targets on energy capable clustering method and routing in the inter cluster protocol. Node possibilities for becoming cluster head and possible radii are computed with fuzzy logic. The Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) based Quality of Service (QOS) algorithm is searching for effectively routing between the cluster head (CH) and the base station (BS). This work demonstrates the performance of unequal cluster head selection with fuzzy logic and improve the QOS in routing with ACO and also suggests the best method for WSN clustering. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Sensor nodes are commonly endowed with data monitoring and broadcasting capabilities. It will communicate the collected data through the radio transceiver to the sink node either directly or through the intermediate nodes. In networking more sensor nodes are required to identify the network fault and also used to identify the risky environment. The general applications of sensor network are not only to increase the system efficiency, at the same time to provide more reliable and secure data transactions throughout the network. But it is a complex issue in sensor networks. In this work, the energy efficient routing protocol with multi-cluster data aggregation is established. The pair wise key is established in node-to-node, node to cluster head, node to common node communication for enhancing the data integrity. Efficient routing through multi cluster with different level data aggregation is achieved and implemented in NS2 simulator. The evaluation metrics like throughput, delay, energy, packet delivery ratio are measured and analyzed. To validate and verify the data integrity, the generation of pair-wise key among the clusters within the network is analyzed and that is used to enhance the fundamental security requirements. The proposed system is developed to reduce the number of data transactions for multi sensor nodes and remove the redundant data and establish an efficient secure routing in WSN. This proposed work demonstrated in NS2 simulator and various metrics are evaluated. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={This paper examines the possibilities of using crushed recycled masonry brick aggregates and ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) as a substitute material for natural coarse aggregate (NA) and cement respectively in concrete. Crushed recycled masonry brick aggregates produced from bricks retrived from demolished masonry structures were used in this study. Fresh and hardened concrete properties such as workability, density of fresh concrete, compressive strength, tensile splitting strength and flexural strength were studied. Two mix series were investigated in this study. In the first mix series course aggregates were partially replaced with 20%, 40% and 60% replacement ratios and the second mix series cement was also replaced with Ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) by 30%. The experimental results were compared with a reference concrete produced with natural coarse aggregates. The test results indicate that RMBA could be used as partial replacement of natural aggregates in concrete with little reduction of concrete properties up to 20% replacement and with reductions up to 30% for 40% and 60% replacements. The slag replacement of 30% improves the concrete properties in all concrete mixes at the age of 28 days. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Boost converters are preferably used for power factor correction (PFC). Boost converters operated in discontinuous current mode (DCM) does not require complicated circuits for control and has reduced number of components. It also presents turning-on of the switch at zero current and absence of reverse recovery in diode. With constant duty ratio, boost converter in DCM has a power factor lesser than unity. In this paper a fuzzy logic based control with variable duty cycle is proposed for the boost converter operating in discontinuous current mode (DCM). The proposed method improves the power factor to almost unity and achieves output voltage regulation. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Geotextiles, geofabrics and geogrids were extensively used over the past several years for many civil engineering applications including reinforcing the sub grade soils. Of late Jute Geo Textiles are being used to improve the strength of subgrade soils used in rural road constructions. Jute is produced largely in India and is available abundantly. In the present paper an attempt was made to determine the strength improvement in identified soils by reinforcing with a non oven mat of Jute Geo-Textile. Two types of soils, namely Lateritic and Murram, procured locally have been identified for investigation. Laboratory California Bearing Ratio (CBR) tests were performed to understand the load penetration behavior of the procured soils (Murram & lateritic) with and without Jute Geo-Textiles. Murram soil being weaker than Lateritic soil showed considerable increase in strength when reinforced with Jute Geo-Textile. But, Lateritic soil did not show significant improvement. Results showed that maximum improvement in strength was obtained by keeping the jute mat at half depth in the muram soil. © Research India Publications.},

When subjected to loading of 8Kpa, the maximum stress obtained by using the 100 × 100 mesh is 4.8 % smaller than the maximum stress obtained by using the 13 × 13 mesh. The difference between maximum deflections obtained from 13 × 13 mesh and 100 × 100 mesh was differ by 2.70 % respectively. The maximum stress and deflection obtained from 35 × 35 mesh sizes which is nearer to ASTM code. Since we have chosen 35 × 35 mesh size is optimum mesh, it was adequately accurate to be used in the analyses. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Sulphur, one of the key ingredients in Ayurvedic formulations has been used as a single drug or in combination with metals to treat various diseases. Classical Ayurvedic texts describe purification techniques for sulphur as well for metals used in combination with sulphur. Butter is used to melt sulphur and the molten sulphur is quenched in milk to bring about an allotropic transformation. Elemental analysis revealed increase in calcium, potassium, phosphorus and sodium content in sulphur which gets incorporated from milk. A substantial increase in carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen content in the sulphur samples indicated incorporation of carbohydrate, protein and lactose content from milk. This was corroborated with decrease in protein and lactose content in the milk after quenching. The process of quenching with water did not result in an allotropic transformation, confirming that milk is responsible for this chemical change. The allotropic modification is necessary to facilitate further reactions of sulphur through mechanochemistry.},

abstract={In large sensor system, cluster-based network formation greatly contributes to the network lifetime, system scalability and energy efficiency. Network lifespan is the unique characteristic for measuring the utility of the sensor system. The important challenge in sensor network is the efficient use of energy for the sensor nodes. In this paper, we spotlight on balancing the power consumption and maximizing the network lifespan. In previous work, the problem is that number of duplicate data transmission occurs by multiple paths from the source to the sink. The proposed Adaptive Network Coding Clustering algorithm solves the above problem by encoding and decoding technique to decrease the number of packets sent to sink. Therefore, power is saved for the broadcast of sensed information than control sachet information. Optimizations that include global topology re-clustering, assignment of adaptive transmission range and sleeping schedules for intra clustering to minimize the energy conservation. Simulation result shows that the minimum number packets sent to sink while comparing to the previous result, hence the lifetime of the network increased significantly. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={A wireless sensor network is collected with thousands of miniature resourceinsufficient sensor nodes, set with controller, transceivers and nonrechargeable batteries. The transmission of data from each sensor node to other nodes consumes more energy than data processing in the controller unit of sensor nodes. To enlarge the network lifetime of WSN, the communication overhead should be kept as minimum as possible. WSN comprises the simple data processing nodes, data aggregator nodes and high end devices for controlling and monitoring the external environment factors. Sensor nodes are randomly failed due to several reasons. Detection of fault node is the important task of protocol designer and also it increases the system efficiency in terms routing, packet delivery ratio. Many works are proposed to identify the fault node in the network and supporting work was presented for replacement of faulty node from the network. During execution of wireless sensor networks, secure routing play a vital role to establish an effective communication among the nodes. In this work, the faulty sensor node and faulty data aggregators are identified and effectively replaced. Grade diffusion process combined with the genetic algorithm techniques are proposed and implemented to identify the faulty data aggregator node from the network. These optimizations will finally improve the WSN lifetime and diminish the sensor node replacement cost. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated using Network simulator to demonstrate the proposed tactic is simple, mountable and well-organized. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Steganography is the art of hiding the reality that communication is carried out, by concealing data in other data. To increase the security of Steganographic techniques by exploring the possibility of data analytics to hide data efficiently and securely. The proposed active steganographic method examines each pixel in an image and categories the pixel into primary and secondary pixels and based on that it creates a mask image that helps to increase the payload and embedding rate with secure encoding function. Then inpainting technique is employed over the mask image to increase data hiding. Hiding data in individual colour segments through selected significant bit (SSB) provides secure data storage and efficient data retrieval and the use of Huffman compression techniques will increase the embedding ratio. During the recovery mechanism the cover image and the secluded data can be retrieved from the stego image without any loss of data and distortion to the cover image. Thus, the proposed scheme renders secure communication along with a greater embedding ratio and improved visual tone. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Traditionally Jatropha tanjorensis is being used as an alternative medicine and the phytochemical investigation of this plant has proved that the leaves contain antioxidant, anti-hyperglycaemic and antiinflammatory bio molecules. The crude protein extract was analyzed by non-reducing native-PAGE, which showed three prominent protein bands with molecular weight of about 78.6, 67.8 and 43.3 KDa. Further, 2D studies and mass spectrometric (MS) analysis were done separately. Protein separations were examined using pH 3-10 nonlinear IEF strip. Totally 89 protein spots were detected differing in their pI values, suggesting a possible difference in their electrostatic charge. In regard to mass spectrometric analysis coupled with in-gel digestions were performed for 5 major protein spots using trypsin and were identified through peptide mass fingerprint of selected peptides in UHPLC-ESI-Quad-TOF and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. Proteomic approach lead to the identification of major proteins from J. tanjorensis. Among various proteins, redox enzymes and DNA binding proteins were found to be most abundantly extracted proteins. These classes of proteins are known for their antioxidant, antimicrobial and anticancer activities and hence the extracted proteins were evaluated for their biological activities with a view to develop a novel therapeutic agent. The proteins extract revealed potent antioxidant and antimicrobial activities, when compared to standards. It showed IC50 value as 173 μg/mL for DPPH scavenging, LPO inhibition (226.2 μg/mL) and hydroxyl ion reducing assays (269.5 μg/mL). In antimicrobial studies it was effective against both gram positive and negative bacteria's such as S. aureus MTCC 96, S. aureus MTCC EI, P. aeruginosa MTCC 741, P. aeruginosa MTCC EI, B. subtilis MTCC 441 and E. coli MTCC 723 with MIC values ranging from 7.8-15.6 μg/mL which are comparable to MIC values of standard antibiotics. Jatropha tanjorensis protein extract has also shown potent cytotoxicity against Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) with an IC50 of 49.9 μg/mL. Present study scientifically proves the traditional usage of Jatropha tanjorensis as a health tonic and for the management of microbial infections.},

abstract={Infrared (IR) radiation is emitted by all objects above zero Kelvin. Since humans are warm blooded they emit infrared radiation. Oxygen saturation is an indicator of disease in humans, based on this oxygen level infrared radiation varies. When oxygen to a body region increases the metabolism in that region is increased which leads to an increase in temperature along that region, due to this increased temperature profile infrared radiation in that region gets increased. Similarly decrease of oxygen to a region leads to reduced metabolism which gives a decrease in temperature profile and infrared radiation. So finding out the intensity variation in the image will leads to the oxygen variation in human body. In this paper an analysis is made by providing an user defined threshold values to the pixels in an image to represent the regions related to its intensity, three threshold values of 0.5, 0.75, 0.9 are used to classify less oxygenated regions in the arthritis patient and higher oxygenated regions in hypothyroidism patient. This allows finding out the disease severity and the regions with similar condition in the given infrared image taken from the patient.

abstract={Petroleum refinery wastewater (PRW) containing hydrocarbon is highly toxic to the environment and the surrounding ecosystem. Proper treatment of the PRW effluent is necessary to remove the pollutants before discharge. Bioremediation is considered to be a promising approach as it is eco-friendly and efficient. The exopolysaccharide (EPS) produced by the O. anthropi acts as a bioemulsifier and showed the highest emulsification activity of 60% on diesel. An EPS yield of about 0.42 g/L was obtained under optimized conditions. The carbohydrate and protein content of the EPS was found to be 71.1% and 19.7% respectively, showing the glycoprotein nature. The structural properties of EPS were analyzed by FT-IR and 1H NMR. The batch degradation of oil in PRW by O. anthropi was studied gravimetrically, and showed about 53% degradation in 7 days, indicating the strong ability of the isolated strain to degrade the hydrocarbons in PRW. © 2014 The Authors.},

Models were developed for continuous current and pulsed current welding at different frequencies (2, 4 and 6 Hz). The transient temperature distributions along the heat-affected zone of the simulated weldments were predicted by considering a moving heat source, the surface heat flux distribution and convectional heat loss in the welded plates. Comparative studies of cooling rates and peak temperatures of the simulated welds between all the generated models were conducted. A realistic temperature at the weld center was also predicted. Results show that both peak temperature and cooling rate exhibit increments with pulsing and also with the increase in frequency up to 4 Hz. Obtained results validated against experimental data showed good agreement. © IMechE 2013.},

abstract={Today, companies across the world are adopting cloud services for efficient and cost effective resource management. However, cloud computing is still in developing stage where there are lots of research problems yet to be solved. One such area is security which addresses issues like privacy, identity management, and trust management among other things. As of now, there exists no standard identity management system for a cloud environment. The aspect of trusted propagation still needs to be tackled. This research work proposes a trusted security architecture for cloud identity management that can dynamically federate user identities. The trust architecture proposed use Bayesian inference and roulette wheel selection technique to evaluate trust scores. Using the proposed trust model, dynamic trust relationships are formed across multiple cloud service providers and identity providers thereby eliminating fragmentation of user identities. The trust model was implemented and tested in Google App Engine. The performance of the trust measures was analysed. Copyright © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

In this work, we have developed an eco-friendly method for the synthesis of Titanium dioxide nanocrystals from Titanium tetraisopropoxide as precursor using Desmodium gangeticum (DG) root extract. The synthesized nanocrystals were characterized by UV-visible spectrophotometry and X-ray diffractometry for their SPR peak as well as crystallite size and shape respectively, scanning electron microscopy for their shape and distribution, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy for functional entity identification and thermogravimetric analysis for their thermal stability. Antioxidant assay, antimicrobial test and reducing potential assay were performed to evaluate their biological behavior. TiO2 nanocrystals exist in an anatase phase with a grain size of about 0.7 nm. The FTIR spectra study provides details regarding the bio-stabilizing agents. The nanocrystals were observed with the spherical shape and were found to be thermally stable between 380 °C and 1000 °C. TiO2 nanocrystals possessed higher DPPH radical scavenging activity than that of their precursor and had better antimicrobial activity against Gram positive bacteria.

abstract={Amyloid beta peptide accumulation in the brain poses a serious threat during Alzheimer's disease. Various strategies to remove or disrupt these plaques with nanoparticles is an emerging area for the treatment for neurodegenerative diseases. The present work attempts to develop a novel strategy to remove the plaques using magnetic field by employing magnetic nanoparticles conjugated with a plaque-targeting ligand. Thioflavin-S (TF-S) was covalently linked to magnetic iron oxide incorporated mesoporous silica, SBA-15 and the material was characterized using microscopic and spectroscopic techniques. This magnetic conjugate (IO-SBA-TF-S) was found to display the ability to remove in vitro, KLVFF peptide, a recognition motif in β-amyloid that has been implicated in plaque formation. This system represents a potential smart system that could herald in the next generation therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Edible oil is an indispensable source of energy for human beings. Nowadays in India, Sunflower oil is replacing the traditional oils pertaining to its qualities such as good in poly unsaturated Fatty acid, less in mono unsaturated fatty acid content and also has a good aroma. As demand for the oil increases,various cases are reported on sunflower oil adulteration with other cheap oils such as palm oil, castor oil and other inedible oils. Our aim is to identify a simple method to discriminate sunflower oil with palm oil, castor oil and Paraffin oil using colorimeter. Colorimeter measures the absorption of light by the substance, for a given wavelength. As sunflower oil is lightyellow in color, when it is adulterated with other oils the absorption changes. This method is simple as it does not require any sample preparation when compared to the chromatographic and spectroscopic methods.Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique is employed to identify the minimum percentageof adulteration detection. Regression is used for quantifying intermediate percentage of adulteration. © 2014 RASAYAN. All rights reserved.},

The substrate temperature gradients in new configurations are lower than that in conventional MCHS due to better distribution of coolant and recirculation. At the same pumping power, thermal resistances in the new designs are lower than the thermal resistances in conventional MCHS.

The highest derivative in the differential equation is expanded into Legendre series; this approximation is integrated while the boundary conditions are applied using integration constants. With the help of Legendre wavelets operational matrices, the Fisher's equation and the fractional Fisher's equation are converted into a system of algebraic equations. Block-pulse functions are used to investigate the Legendre wavelets coefficient vectors of nonlinear terms. The convergence of the proposed methods is proved.

abstract={The piers to the bridge are very important component for the stability of bridge structure. These piers need to be placed within the channel width in addition to the abutment wall on either side of water ways. This arrange in the bridge structure obstruct the flow and may cause an increase in water level on upstream side of the bridge. This increase in water level is termed as afflux and this afflux may create adverse impact on the stability of bridge and responsible for scouring action around the bridge pier especially during flood flow. In the present work, the drag characteristic of bridge piers with respect to its shape is studied. Rectangular model with triangular nose and tail shaped pier models are made for various aspect ratios with constant contraction ratio of 0.4. The experiment is conducted for sub-critical flow conditions in a flume having rectangular flow section. The afflux, drag force and coefficient of drag are calculated for different discharge values and their variations with respect to Froude number are studied. On comparing the experimental results with the Yarnell's formula, the most widely used empirical equation for calculation of backwater rise; it was found that the Yarnell's equation gives over estimated results. In the present study, a different shape co-efficient value (a with respect nose dimension is determined and suggested. This new K value can be used for triangular shaped bridge piers having a various aspect ratio. It was found that the rise in water level due to bridge pier is a function of aspect ratio, pier shape and Froude number. © 2014 Knowledpa Review, Malaysia.},

abstract={Most of water supply infrastructures were put in place during India's independence period and some pipelines are over 70 years old. Ageing and uncertainty on its performance under increased and varying demand pattern puts tremendous pressure on water authorities to rehabilitate the existing system for complete revamping the system. Complete revamping does not only mount the cost to the water authority but also makes potential inconvenience to the consumer in terms of getting new connection with new line. Hence, it is essential to rehabilitate the pipes which are more sensitive in serving the locality. Rehabilitating the existing system is generally done by either replacing the existing pipes with same or higher diameter or laylng parallel pipe with existing. The optimal selection of such a combination is a furious task to water authorities. In the present study, a combined simulation-optimization modeling approach is developed using EPANET simulation engine. Differential evolution algorithm is adopted to arrive at the optimal solution. The demonstration proves that if the required data are available, the rehabilitation and expansion can be performed in an optimal manner using the model presented. © 2014 Knowledpa Review, Malaysia.},

There are many geometrical parameters which influence the discharge capacity of the PK weir. The discharge capacity is a functional characteristic of geometrical parameters. To have a better understanding of the effects of PK weir geometry on discharge capacity, three PK weirs of varying geometrical parameters were physically tested in the laboratory. For each design the discharge was measured by keeping constant upstream depth and noting down the downstream depths at various sections for respective upstream depths. From the experimental results, Cd and Qa values were found to be different for all configurations. The values Cd and Qa were found to be dependent on various parameters viz., inlet width (Wi), outlet width (Wo), floor slope and parapet wall. The Weir height (P) and the width of the Weir (w) were kept constant for all the three Weirs. Also the profile of nappe in the downstream length was plotted for each model for different upstream depths and comparisons were made. © 2014 Knowledpa Review, Malaysia.},

abstract={An economic design of water distribution system components plays an important role in the water-supplying agency due to requirement of large financial investment on construction, operation and maintenance. Due to rapid growth of population and urbanization, inadequacy of source, the old water distribution networks are in detrimental condition to meet the growing demand. This posed a challenging problem to municipal engineers in taking decision on rehabilitation or revamping the existing network within the available fund. The effective construction of a distribution network heavily depends on the design, directly influencing the financial investment required. The time factor plays a critical role in securing initial sanctions for commencing a project. This study proposes a spatial approach for preparation of preliminary estimate for the design of real water distribution network. The pipe network layouts for the study area are prepared using satellite imagery and pipe sizing is done by proposed Heuristic approach. Segment-wise population is estimated. The demand to be met by each pipe network is estimated and projected for future population growth. Heuristic concept is employed to determine the near-optimum size of the network pipes. Spatial approach results in quick and easy determination of population and thus can be used for preparing a preliminary estimate facilitating quick financing. The proposed Heuristic approach pves a practical and nearly economical solution in designing a water distribution network. © 2014 Knowledpa Review, Malaysia.},

Disposal of waste product from steel industries becomes a huge threat and created an environmental concern. The GGBFS collected in the present work was subjected to grinding for two and half hours using planetary ball mill to reduce the size to a nano scale. Reduction in particle size was ensured by particle size analyzer. The sample was later used as a partial substitute to cement in three different percentages namely 5, 10 and 15. A high strength concrete mix with a characteristic compressive strength of 50 MPa was selected for the present study. Both sorptivity and voids tests were performed as per ASTM standards Test results showed that replacement of cement with nano sized slag improves the performance of concrete by modifying the micro structure and found that concrete with 10% of nano sized slag yielded best performance in terms of offering resistance to capillary suction and reduction in volume of voids.},

abstract={Concrete is the widely used building material and cement is the main constituent in the manufacturing of concrete. With the intention of overcoming the environmental issues of cement, an effort has been made to find a substitute for cement by using industrial by-products such as flyash and slag which are rich in Silicon (Si) and Aluminium (Al) content to react with an alkaline solution, which is a mixture of Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and Sodium Silicate (Na2SiO3) to form a paste, which are termed as Geopolymers. In this regard, an experimental investigation has been made to study the variation in the Compressive Strength of slag based Geopolymer concrete by varying the concentration of Sodium hydroxide as 10, 12, 14M and the ratio of alkaline solution (SiO3 2-/OH-) as 1.0, 1.5, 2.0. The compressive strength of the mixes was determined for their 3, 7, 14 and 28 days curing for studying there variation at different age of curing. The test results show that the compressive strength of the Geopolymer mixes increases with the increase in the NaOH concentration and alkaline ratio.},

abstract={Polymers are one of the major functional components in a number of biomedical devices for applications ranging from clinical diagnosis, extracorporeal procedures up to in vivo applications such as tissue engineering, biosensors and drug delivery. Owing to the chemical diversity of polymers and their dynamic structure-processing condition-property relationship, in-depth characterization of the material chosen for a specific biomedical application is indispensable. This chapter is a compendium of facts, challenges and opportunities in the characterization of biomedical polymers. As a guideline to the beginner, a general framework has been introduced to enable hierarchical characterization of biomedical polymers. Thermal, mechanical, optical and electrical characterization is discussed under bulk characterization techniques. Surface characterization has been discussed in terms of microscopic, wettability and spectroscopic studies. The discussion unfolds several aspects of bulk and surface characterization highlighting critical challenges in sample handling, sterilization procedure and extrapolation of in vitro results to in vivo behaviour. After discussing application-specific aspects, future directions in surmounting key challenges in characterizing biomedical polymers are indicated. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The day to day advancements in science and technology resulted in enormous data transaction and demand for secure communication and e-banking are not an exception. The usage of ATMs for cash withdrawal and other transaction related works is massive. Looking at the elements required by a customer for ATM utility, the debit card and secure PIN are being sent separately by postal service to the customers of many banks for increased security. However, tampering is always possible because of the unique mode of sending the both card as well as PIN authentication to the customers. Here we suggest an alternative method to enhance the security with respect to debit card and PIN communication to the customers with LabVIEW based transform domain steganography approach where the PIN will be hidden in the scanned Debit card image with the help of Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and swapping algorithm. This transformed image will be e-mailed to the customers. Proper retrieval algorithm will be used by the concerned customers to reveal the secret PIN authentication. Histogram report, error metrics like MSE and PSNR have also been discussed in this study for sample ATM debit card image. © 2014 Academic Journals Inc.},

abstract={The electronic transport property of tungsten nitride nanoribbon-based molecular device is investigated using density functional theory. The study on electronic transport properties are discussed in terms of device density of states and transmission spectrum of the nanoribbon. The scattering region of the nanoribbon is placed between the electrodes. For different bias voltages, the transport properties are studied. The contribution due to various orbitals leads to the peak maximum in device density of states. The transmission spectrum and transmission pathway provides insight to the transmission of charge under various bias conditions. The maximum peak in the transmission spectrum corresponds to the variation in transmission of charge with different bias voltage. The reported results will pave the way to improve the performance in the field of nanoelectronics. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

Pot experiment was selected and potassium dichromate was used as the source of chromium. Test group soil was contaminated with 30 mg/kg chromium. The effect of used fertilizers on antioxidant enzymes and pigments were analyzed. The ameliorating potential of fertilizers were compared by providing chromium alone and chromium with fertilizers. The antioxidant enzymes increased in chromium treated plants and slightly decreased by the application of fertilizers. Fertilizer application reduces the chromium accumulation in roots and shoots slightly and prevents oxidative damage. The plant pigments was much affected by Cr but brought back to normalcy by fertilizers. The ameliorating potential of NPK is much better than other fertilizers which accumulates moderate level of Cr in shoot and root but alleviates its effects.},

abstract={Context: The first successful molecule against herpes infections was Acyclovir, which competes with new generations in the market, with its potential activity. The major physicochemical constraints and pharmacokinetics of Acyclovir such as low solubility, poor permeability, less half-life, high dose has initiated many researchers to develop diverse modified release dosage forms. Objective: The objective of this work was to design polymeric nanoparticles of Acyclovir and then incorporate the drug-loaded nanoparticles within an in situ gelling system to provide dual sustained release effect, whereby the duration of action and bioavailability through different routes of administration could be improved. Materials and methods: The formulation was designed through 3 2 factorial design, first developing the nanoparticles using Polycaprolactone and Pluronic F127 by Solvent evaporation process, followed by dispersion of the suspended nanoparticles into thermosensitive in situ gelling system of Pluronic F127 with Carbopol. Results and discussion: The characterization of the nanoparticles and its sol-gel system performed through zeta sizer, SEM, XRD, TG-DSC, FTIR and rheology helped to optimize the formulation. The drug release could be sustained to 60% and 30% at eight hours, for the nanoparticles and their in situ gel systems, respectively, with non-Fickian diffusion mechanism of drug release. The test for % cell viability with NIH3T3 cell line revealed low level of toxicity for the nanoparticles. Conclusion: The statistical significance obtained for the trail formulations experimentally proved its suitability for this dosage form design to achieve desired level of drug release. © 2014 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

abstract={Any processor's performance is dependent on three important factors namely speed, area and power. A better trade-off between these factors makes the processor, an effective one. Multipliers are the commonly used architectures inside the processor. If the performance of these multipliers are improved then powerful processors can be created in future. In this paper, the proposed multiplier design based on the sutra- 'Urdhva Tiryakbhyam' of vedic mathematics is analyzed and the performance results of the multiplier are compared with conventional multipliers. Vedic mathematics is an ancient mathematics system which is based on 16 sutras, gives distinctive ideas for obtaining solutions with ease. The design is done using Verilog HDL and the processes such as simulation and synthesis are done using ModelSim ALTERA 6.5b and Xilinx ISE Design Suite 13.2. © 2014 S. Koushighan, K. Hariharan and V.

abstract={Non-linear loads and applications of power electronics in 3P4W (three phase four wire) distribution system are the major sources of harmonics. The power quality compensator which mitigates the problem related to Current harmonics is Shunt active filter (SAPF) or passive filter. Active filtering is the most efficient mitigating method adopted for reactive power compensation and mitigation of harmonics. The power quality compensator proposed in this paper is a SAPF which reduces the %THD, compensates reactive power and mitigates neutral current under unbalanced non-linear load condition. A 3-φ{symbol} MOSFET based 3 leg VSI (Voltage Source Inverter) with DC bus capacitor as energy buffer is employed to realize the SAPF. Fuzzy logic based Direct control method is the propounded control strategy implemented for the estimation of reference current and to keep the voltage of DC capacitor to its reference value. Switching signals for the VSI is generated using Hysteresis current controller. T-connected and Zig-Zag transformers are implemented to reduce the neutral current to about 1/10th of its original value in unbalanced Non-linear load conditions. The propounded control strategy performance is validated and analyzed using MATLAB software. © 2014 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.},

abstract={Desmostachya bipinnata (L.) Stapf, Poaceae, or Kusha in Sanskrit, is a sacred grass used extensively in Indian Vedic practices. It is well known for its medicinal value and is used in traditional Indian medicine to treat microbial infection in combination with other herbs. An effort has been made to isolate and characterize the bioactive compounds from the hydroalcoholic extract of D. bipinnata through bioassay guided fractionation, column chromatography. Their individual or combined antimicrobial properties were determined by the Resazurin Microtitre Assay, the checkerboard assay in combination with antibiotics, and by time kill curve analysis. β-Sitosterol-D-glucopyranoside was the bioactive compound identified to have the best antimicrobial activity (MIC 6-50 μg/ml) and it works synergistically with most antibiotics, especially with ciprofloxacin. Time kill curves showed that BS kills most of the pathogens within 5-10 h.

abstract={Delivery of drug by conventional systems are characterized by release of drug instantly, where the drug release and maintaining effective concentration at target site cannot be controlled. These patterns of dosing results in constantly fluctuating and unpredictable plasma concentration. For controlled drug delivery systems, controlled manner drug release can be achieved for prolonged period. There are many oral controlled drug delivery systems available in market, in which Osmotic Drug Delivery Systems (ODDS) have significant importance, as they have many advantages compared to others. Formulation and operation are easy in ODDS., improves patient acceptance with lowered frequency of dosing and provides prolonged therapeutic effectiveness with uniform blood concentration. In ODDS, the release of the drug is based on zero order kinetics which does not depend on the initial concentration and the physiological parameters of gastrointestinal (GI) tract like absence or presence of food, pH and temperature. The release properties can easily be studied and predicted from drug properties and dosage form available. Drug delivery through osmotic systems can be classified based on their design and the state of active ingredients. In this paper, various marketed osmotically controlled Push-Pull Osmotic Pumps (PPOPs) with their basic components and factors affecting have been discussed briefly. PPOP is a customized Elementary Osmotic pump, which can deliver both drugs with poor and high water solubility at a constant rate.},

abstract={The ultimate aim of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is to gather valuable information from the sensor environment through sensor nodes. Nowadays, application areas of WSNs are wide, so it is significant to increase WSN lifetime, throughput and also to ensure energy conservation. In Homogeneous WSN, data aggregation is handled in a easier way because of common characteristics of sensor nodes and its generated data, but it is difficult to perform data aggregation at heterogeneous sensor networks because of synchronization of different packets generated by different sensors. Most existing algorithms use static routing and suitable for homogeneous networks only. Even though the Attribute-aware Data Aggregation (ADA) scheme follows a dynamic routing for heterogeneous networks, it leads to unwanted routing paths due to pheromone evaporation in nodes. In order to eliminate the excess routing paths and energy wastages due to it, our proposed protocol READAT gives a consistent data aggregation in dynamic routing, which ensures the nodes belonging to same characteristic group their data for aggregation even though pheromone evaporated. This consistent way of data aggregation gives more balanced energy conservation and prolonging network lifetime. © Research India Publications.},

Trajectory structures of simulations stored at every 5 picoseconds were used for analysis of different structural events occurring in unfolding of the proteins. CTX III retained its three-dimensional conformation throughout the simulations performed in all 4 different temperatures used in the study, whereas, CBTX underwent remarkable structural changes at 473 K. Data analysis of the MD revealed that C-terminal region of CBTX is much more unstable and flexible comparing the counterpart segments in CTX III. Moreover, the MD simulations analysis clearly showed that overall unfolding stability of CTX III was stronger than that of CBTX. These findings were consistent with structural stabilities of the proteins reported in the literature and also reinforcement the 'CN network' hypothesis, which is useful to predict thermodynamic stabilities of three-finger toxins super-family from snake venoms in qualitative manner.},

abstract={In the recent electronic era power quality issues are creating lot of problems in terms of performance and efficiency of an electric power system. This includes both voltage and current related power quality problems. The voltage issues consist of sag/ swell, flicker, interrupts or outages. The problem related to current consists of harmonics, reactive component, unbalance and excessive neutral current issues. In order to mitigate these issues recent trend has come up with one of the custom power devices known as unified power quality conditioning system (UPQC). It contains both shunt and series active filters connected using a DC link. The shunt inverter reduces harmonics in the load side where as the series compensator minimizes the voltage sag/swell in the supply side. The proposed control strategy implemented in this paper for UPQC is one cycle control (OCC). This OCC provides a power quality conditioning system without any reference current. The vector operation of this controller reduces the losses in the system and also provides fast dynamic response. It is flexible to work in both three phase three wire and three phase four wire system. The reliability of the proposed method is evaluated using MATLAB Simulink results. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={In a network, the freely movable and reachable network is called a social network. Online social network environment plays an efficient role in real life for many people. The size of the social network is not fixed; it can be reshaped when people interact with each other in different ways. There are a large number of online websites and social networks like Google+, Facebook, linked in, twitter, etc. The network predicts the collective information about user behavior. They also provide great opportunities for mining data and it presents novel challenges. From the given information provided by some individuals we can infer the behavior of them. But predicting the information about any unobserved individual in the same network is a tough job. The existing clustering methods increase the number of clusters. A method based on Incremental Clustering is proposed to restrict the number of clusters and to read the data only once. This clustering approach provides greater security to the user and increases the performance speed. © Research India Publications.},

In MANETs, security and routing issues needs to be focused since it may lead to data loss and provides gateway to the attacker to enter into the network. Existing approaches in secure routing, uses location based approaches which results in time delay. In this paper, we propose a secure routing algorithm using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to find the optimized path from the set of initial shortest path.

abstract={The increasing demand for electricity makes the electric grid still expanding and complex. To make the grid smarter and more reliable, continuous monitoring of power system is required. Nowadays traditional measurement systems are replaced by Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU), which enables online monitoring by measuring time tagged voltage phasors with the aid of Global Positioning System. Using current measurement of PMU, the adjoining bus voltage is estimated. PMUs are having number of application in power system monitoring, control and protection. The process of placing PMU in all buses of power system for full observability will result in redundancy. The optimal PMU placement problem for better Wide area monitoring is great scope of research. This paper recommends the optimal locations of PMU in Tamil Nadu (TNEB 69 bus system) of Indian electric grid using Binary Integer Linear Programming (BILP). The PMU placement problem has been defined and optimization process carried out in MATLAB. The stated approach is worldwide to suit various aspects of optimal PMU placement problem. Cases with and without zero injection buses are considered for computation and solved using linear constraints. Consequently, a simple, effective method is also developed to handle single PMU outage in the TNEB 69 bus system. © Research India Publications.},

A compact low power Switched Mode Power Supply is designed to have isolated output DC voltages of values +12V, +3.3V and +5V. The three output voltages are well regulated. Instead of using multiple number of DC-DC converters for multiple output SMPS a single LLC resonant converter is used to decrease the complexity and cost of the system. A diode rectifier integrated with a high frequency transformer provides the isolated and regulated multiple outputs. A 200W multiple outputs SMPS using a LLC resonant converter is designed and simulated using MATLAB SIMLINK. A software based PID controller is used to regulate the output voltages.

abstract={The main aim of this paper is to produce a security for the message in a communication medium. For that we are using some approaches, such as Stegnography, QR Code and Cryptography. We are all familiar with the concept of various stegnography and cryptography technique. We also included an emerging technique which is QR code. This QR Code technique gets popular after the invention of Android Os. In our paper, we make an encryption for the message (strings) by make use of cryptographic technique and then we make a QR code for that encrypted message. Finally we hide that QR Code in the cover image by using stegnographic technique. In the existing methodology in stegnography,they hide only image, text, audio or video, but we are hiding a QR-code. So that the size of the output file of stego image has been reduced compared with the existing methodology. If we hide the data directly to the cover image takes a lot of memory. Hence we use indirectly to use QR Code to store information and then we hide it in the cover image. QR code can store huge information with less storage conception. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={The demand is increasing for live streaming in the last few years. In the client side the excellence of the video playback is poor due to load balancing, congestion and bottlenecks in the current architectures. If we use the constant bit rate, the video cannot be viewed correctly because each client will have a dissimilar bandwidth. If the bitrate is very high, to view the stream some clients may not have sufficient bandwidth. If the bandwidth of the client is set to be very low, the video cannot be viewed with full quality. In multiple bit rate video streaming, each client can download the video at the suitable rate according to its bandwidth. In this paper we are focusing on the Peer to Peer (P2P) architecture which is based on BitTorrent. This architecture supports various bitrate as well as reduces the load on the server. Multiple trackers and the time synchronization concept between them is also included. The simulation results evidence that the projected architecture performs better than the current client-server and P2P architecture. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={An induction motor drive capable of operating loads demanding inverse torque - speed characteristics such as a spooler load using a controller employing vector control and space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) of a sixpulse inverter is presented in this paper. Such a drive requires a variable voltage, variable frequency voltage-source inverter and a speed and current feedback configuration. Here the role of the controller is to generate a sequence of reference speed, torque and current profiles to meet the mechanical load requirements. The mechanical profile requires concurrent variation of torque and speed over a range depending on the mechanical dimensions of the take-up spooler and product line specifications. The control scheme adopted here is based on the indirect field-oriented vector-control technique where decoupling of the torque and rotor flux variables is achieved and the desired stator current vector in a synchronous rotating frame of reference is generated. The simulation of the above drive system covering motor model, vector control (field- orientation) algorithm and SVPWM equation is carried out using MATLAB/SIMULINK software. The simulation results indicate satisfactory performance of a typical spooler drive system over the full range of operation. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={New hybrid cascaded seven level inverter is proposed in this paper and also deals with Multiple Reference pulse width Modulation Technique. Nowadays, Multilevel inverter becomes more popular because of handling high voltage, high power, and less total harmonic distortion. This paper is highly focussed on hybrid topology which utilises less number of power switches compared to conventional cascaded H-bridge inverter thus the cost and switching loss will be minimum. The New Hybrid Cascaded seven level inverter with very low switching loss is ideal for such operations. The simulation of New hybrid cascaded seven level inverter is done by using the software MATLAB. The modulation strategy of Multiple Reference Modulation technique uses very low switching frequency. The hardware was also implemented by using power MOSFET, power diodes and dc voltage source to validate the simulation and experimental results. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={The reliability of the power system is increased by connecting various distributed generation sources (DG) with main power grid. The main problem in these connections is when a fault occurs at the power grid, it is required to protect the DG from fault current. The above said problem can be resolved by using SFCL (super conducting fault current limiter), as it can greatly limits the initial fault current. The proposed work is to identify an optimal placement of SFCL using transient analysis, for different SFCL locations. A power system network with wind farm as DG was implemented for finding the perfect place of SFCL and that perfect place is found to be the integration of the DG sources with power grid. © Research India Publications.},

In this study, SEM is used to check the hydration process of concrete subjected to accelerated curing process. The temperature gradient created in concrete specimen during the accelerated curing process may lead to non-uniform curing of concrete. This hypothesis was tested in this work with sample study.

abstract={The purpose of face detection is to discover the faces in image and video. We exhibit neural network to detect human face. Existing approaches are working well but not robust in detecting faces under complex environment and illumination changes. The proposed method has overcomes that problem by using Gabor wavelets. Each feature extraction points contain the important characteristics of human face. Neural networks analyze the input image and resolves whether it contains face or not. This classification negotiates among several networks to improve the performance within a single network. Feature vectors are built by using Gabor feature extraction on human face and non face. The reduced feature vectors are given to the input for the neural network. Proposed method has been tested with large number of images to show the strength of proposed method. Performance measures like face detection rates, false positive rates, processing time are compared with Support Vector Machine classifier. Neural network works better than SVM classifier in terms of false positives, elapsed time and the results are reported.

abstract={As the new era gives birth to new techniques there is simultaneous birth of attack mechanisms to bring down those new inventions. The possibilities of attacks in web applications are quite increasing nowadays. Hence security becomes a challenging task to eradicate the attacks in applications. There are certain methods capable of injecting attacks in systems thereby degrading its performance. The prevention mechanisms have to be followed in order to improve a site's security by analysing the kind of attacks that are also more prolific. This builds a necessity to create awareness among the public about the knowledge of variety of attacks and their preventions. This paper proposes a detailed study about the most frequent security risks in web applications which will lead to the deployment of better security which in turn will depict a very good understanding about the risks involved in web applications and how they are discovered by security professionals for their ultimate removal from infecting the target web applications through the development of a unified framework that provides security against identified attacks for the popular languages like PHP and ASP by means of API support. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Electricity has become one of the indispensable things in developing and developed countries. It is one of the non-renewable forms of energy which is most convenient and easy to use. There should be proper usage and conservation of electricity in order to make it available to all needful people. So, the proposed model focuses on the energy conservation issue by using the intelligent energy meter concept in a cloud computing environment. In this model, with the help of current transformer (C.T) and potential transformer (P.T), energy theft can be detected and upon detection, meter can be made to shut down without any manual interference. The model consists of two modules, data gathering & processing module and data visualization module. ARM (LPC2148) microcontroller plays a vital role in data gathering & processing module. GSM 900 module, whose uplink and downlink frequency range is 890-915 MHz & 935-960 MHz respectively, is used for communication between two modules of the proposed model. Software as a Service (SaaS) (a service provider in cloud computing) forms the core part of data visualization module. Through web portal and android application (which can be accessed anytime by user in his mobile phone) energy users can know their day to day energy units consumed and amount charged against it. This will help in alerting users about their energy units consumed if their current energy amount is exceeding their personal monthly budget. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Residue-specific stabilities of proteins can be studied by using hydrogen/deuterium exchange methods in conjunction with nuclear magnetic resonance techniques (H/D NMR). Under EX2 exchange conditions, residue-specific equilibrium unfolding constants of residues are ratio of intrinsic exchange rate constants (krc) to extrinsic exchange rate constants (kex) of backbone amide protons (NHs) of respective amino acids in proteins. While krc of each NH in proteins can be theoretically calculated on the basis of model peptide studies, kex values are to be experimentally determined by using H/D NMR under optimized solution conditions. However, the method is technically challenging, expensive, time consuming and require sound knowledge in protein chemistry. In the present study, we demonstrate a computational strategy to predict residue-specific stabilities of proteins on the basis of residue-specific 'long range weighted contact order (LRWCO)', which can be readily calculated by using structural coordinates of proteins. Rationalization on the correspondence between residue-specific LRWCO and residue-specific free energies (determined by H/D NMR) of cardiotoxin III, an all β-sheet protein from venom of Naja naja atra, has been described in detail as a model system. In addition, various structural parameters that may be useful to improve the prediction accuracy of the strategy on calculating the residue-specific stabilities of proteins have also been discussed.},

Steady state condition-Situation of the system undergoing the gradual or relatively slow transformation of real and reactive power in the system in both generator bus as well as load bus. Transient condition-The power system has the capacity to sustain in synchronism, during the transient interruption such as fault on bus, fault on transmission lines, sudden loss of generation, etc. (ii)With Asynchronous generation-Displacing the asynchronous units (wind generation) on the synchronous system and the rotor angle is enhanced for the test system. The asynchronous units applied to the test system are Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG). The IEEE-39 bus test system is adopted for the determination of the rotor angle. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={The feasibility of coupled biohydrogen and polyhydroxyalkanoate production by Enterobacter aerogenes and Rhodobacter sphaeroides using Calophyllum inophyllum oil cake was studied under dark and photo fermentation conditions. The utilization of a non-edible acidic oil cake (C. inophyllum), and exploitation of a modified minimal salt media led to reduction in the cost of media. Cost of fermentation is reduced by implementation of alternate dark-photo fermentative periods and through the use of a co-culture consisting of a dark fermentative (E. aerogenes) and a photo fermentative (R. sphaeroides) bacterium. The biohydrogen and polyhydroxyalkanoate produced were 7.95L H2/L media and 10.73g/L media, respectively, under alternate dark and photo fermentation and were 3.23L H2/L media and 5.6g/L media, respectively under complete dark fermentation. The characteristics of the oil cake and alternate dark (16h) and photo (8h) fermentative conditions were found to be supportive in producing high biohydrogen and polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) yield. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

In case of hostile environment, it is impossible to replace the battery unit of WSN. In order to prolong the lifetime of the network, several energy conservation schemes are designed. Most general technique used is putting the sensor nodes in sleep mode when its intended work has been carried out by other sensors. This paper investigates how a set of targets are covered by available sensor nodes and energy consumption for desired coverage. In the proposed work, a scheduling algorithm EETC is used which helps to construct the proper sensor set for activation. The sensor set which is selected will be in active mode only for specific time interval. EETC conserves some energy compared to the existing methods. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Contemporary trends in wireless sensor network, provides development of low cost intelligent remote industrial monitoring and control system forming industrial wireless sensor network. Concurrent access and transmission by multiple sensor nodes are essential for continuous monitoring in industrial applications which also leads to packet collision with undesirable effects. In order to avoid packet collision for reliable communication among sensor nodes, RTOS based architecture is proposed. Packets are scheduled in a timely manner and timing integrity is guaranteed efficiently by using μcos-II RTOS. Synchronous nodes in the industrial field senses impact in the data acquisition section which contains LPC2148 processor as a processing center for solving real time transmission scheduling problem. In real time, the tasks are scheduled according to the emergency of data by assigning priority and executed non-preemptively. So both high and low priority tasks are allowed to execute simultaneously without any packet collision and avoiding packet loss. Base station receives the concurrent data without any data loss and viewed synchronously to prove the reliable communication between nodes by usage of the proposed algorithm. The main objective of the system is to provide timely and reliable data transmission between nodes for intelligent industrial automation system with multiprocessor support using RTOS. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Face recognition is the process of verifying or identifying an individual automatically by comparing the selected features with the features stored in a database. It is essential in the field of airport security, access control and financial service. Facial recognition includes feature extraction and classification. The accuracy rate of the existing methods is less and occupies more space. To address these problems, EFID (Extracting Features by Interpolating and Down-sampling) method based on interpolation and downsampling is proposed. The feature vector can be extracted by down-sampling the image using bilinear interpolation. In bilinear interpolation, the nearest of a 2×2 neighborhood known pixel values are taken, which surrounds the unknown pixel values in the computed location. The interpolated value is obtained by the weighted average of the pixel values. The set of interpolated values forms the feature vector. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier classifies the faces based on the obtained feature vector. The performance of the proposed method can be evaluated by conducting a series of experiments on the GT database. The EFID method provides a high accuracy rate compared to other existing techniques. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Energy efficiency is a key consequence in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), because of the restriction in energy resources. In order to sustain the sensor networks lifetime, the cluster method splits the network into several clusters. In clustering mechanism, the cluster head gathers information from the nodes and submit it to the Base Station (BS). The clustering mechanism has two critical issues; Picking out an optimal set of sensor nodes and choosing best cluster head to partition the network. In most of the equal clustering method do not consider the location of the base station and it creates hot spot trouble in multi-hop routing. Clusters which are located nearer the base station are suffering from dense traffic, which leads the nodes to die prematurely in intercluster communication. To balance energy consumption in sensor network, the proposed method (EBPUC-EAR) implement particle swarm optimization (PSO) that split the network into uneven size clusters and provide power efficient routing. The EBPUC-EAR contains two phases: (i) Energy-balanced PSO based unequal clustering, (ii) Energy-Aware routing (EAR). First, the BS executes EBPUC to generate unequal clusters and determine best cluster head. Then, EAR builds an optimal path for inter cluster communication among each cluster heads. The result shows that EBPUC-EAR has a great improvement in balancing energy in the network and data delivery ratio compared with LEACH and PSO-C algorithm. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Emtricitabine is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor used for HIV infections, with oral bioavailability of 93 %. Microparticles loaded with emtricitabine were formulated through ionotropic gelation method using sodium alginate as retardant polymer and calcium chloride as cross linker. The concentration of hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose and sodium alginate were varied as 50-300 mg and 100- 900 mg respectively using 32 factorial design. The prepared microparticles were evaluated for particle size distribution (322.66 to 553.40 μm), percentage yield (96.68-98.33 %) drug content (92.85-95.23%) and drug entrapment efficiency (27.41 to 52.44 %). The FT-IR spectroscopic analysis indicated the minimum drug polymer interaction during preparation. The stability and uniform dispersion of drug in the polymeric matrix was confirmed by DSC and XRD studies. The in vitro release profile indicated that increase in intensity of cross linking decreased the rate of drug release, with showed significant sustained release effect of the dosage form for more than 8 h.},

abstract={The usage of Microelectronic semiconductor application has increased rapidly. Hence there is a need to test the semiconductor application to identify the fault in the Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Circuits in small duration of time. To reduce the test time, we need to reduce the test data during testing process. To reduce the test vector the unspecified logic states (X-states) were captured by test compression methods using the scan elements. In this paper hardware based implementation of channel masking is proposed for reducing the number of test patterns. The channel masking usually masks the unspecifiedstates and it permits compression techniques on variety of designs. The compactor viz., Multiple Input Signature Register (MISR) architecture was used for processing test responses with the number of unspecified values. The masking register permits the compactor to adjust X-densities and provides better performance. The method proposed which reduce the power and area consumption by modifying the architecture of masking logic. The design architecture is described using VHDL code and targeted to XILINX Spartan 3E FPGA. © Research India Publications.},

Unknown value reduction issues, while mask out problem seized in different scan cells from the occurrence of the compactor. In this research work, we propose that control x-distribution in scan paths preceding the propagation to the compactor and x-align block to enhance the ceiling amount of scan cell which observed through response compactor and also the response compactor align unknown values inside scan slices. The manipulated response is carried out on the test patterns basis; such as scan path delay functions as well as unknown value of X's is aligned in less number of scan slices. Objective of the X-Alignment method is to improve the observability of scan paths and reducing the size of test vector of response compactor in Integrated Circuit Design. In this paper, we proposed PAlignment technique by restructuring the scan paths and achieved the large amount of scan cells are observed through compactor circuits.

Multilevel STATCOM mainly deals with the minimization of THD in multilevel inverter output voltage. Main interest is given to line voltage in three phase application to achieve a reduction in THD%. In multilevel inverter, switching angle is chosen to reduce the output voltage THD, which is suggested by IEEE 519 standard.

Here we provide a foundation for warping which is theoretical and is based on experimental uses. From our results, this method is better than previously used techniques of scene flow estimation, since it is considerably small angular errors.

abstract={Abundant availability of Radio Frequency in the environment is utilized for harvesting energy, but the harvested energy level is not sufficient enough to activate the sensor nodes deployed in unreachable locations. The antenna used for harvesting the RF energy should be designed accurately in order to increase the efficiency of harvesting. Microstrip antenna capable of harvesting energy from the 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi frequency band has a low profile with compact size so the microstrip antenna is utilized in this work. The microstrip antenna is modified into an insert feed microstrip antenna for optimizing the harvesting capability which in turn will increase the output power. Therefore an array of insert feed microstrip antenna is connected in series for generating high output power sufficient enough for activating the sensor node. This work measures and displays the harvested energy level using voltage sensor with LPC2148. The antenna initially designed for single frequency band of 2.4 GHz but both 2.4 GHz resonant frequencies at -20.5dB return loss and 5GHz resonant frequency of -20dB. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Mercury intrusion porosimetry provides information like pore size distribution, the porosity, density, and surface area of a sample. Compared to other methods of porosity characterization, mercury intrusion porosimetry provides wide range of information. With the development of science, new methods are being applied for studying the porosity. However, mercury intrusion porosimetry is still very popular though it has few limitations. The pore size distribution of the cement paste that develops in concrete and motar was measured by mercury intrusion. Mercury intrusion porosimetry was criticized seriously due to ink-bottle problem which slowed the use of this technique; however, later the problem was circumvented with intrusionextrusion cycles. New researches push mercury intrusion porosimetry to further levels. The literature studied so far indicates that mercury intrusion porosimetry is a potential tool to identify the pore characteristics of concrete in a cost effective manner. Researchers analyze pores in concrete for the many years with the objective that the pore details can provide information on the strength characteristics of concrete. In this paper, detailed literature review is presented on mercury intrusion porosimetry, which provides sufficient cautions while using this technique. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Path planning of a mobile robot in the presence of multiple moving obstacles is found to be a complicated problem. A planning algorithm capable of negotiating both static and moving obstacles in an unpredictable (on-line) environment is proposed. The proposed incremental algorithm plans the path by considering the quadrants in which the current positions of obstacles as well as target are situated. Also, the governing equations for the shortest path are derived. The proposed mathematical model describes the motion (satisfying constraints of the mobile robot) along a collision-free path. Further, the algorithm is applicable to dynamic environments with fixed or moving targets. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Comparison of results with the improved artificial potential field (iAPF) algorithm shows that the proposed algorithm yields shorter path length with less computation time. © 2014 Central South University Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Computer systems employ user authentication as their primary means to protect system resources from unauthorised users and malicious attacks. Especially when multiple users share a set of systems and resources, effective authentication is very much required. Over the years, several authentication methods have been developed. The most commonly used method is the textual password based authentication. Users are required to choose a text comprising of alphabets, numbers and symbols. Once passwords are registered with the system, users need to recall and submit it each time of their login. Even though textual passwords are simple, they are vulnerable to many kinds of attacks. They are also cumbersome to be remembered. There are also biometric schemes that are based on user's physical characteristics. They need expensive devices to implement. Recently images based graphical password schemes have received the attention of researchers. Human being's ability to remember images is well established. So in this paper, a new graphical password scheme based on geographical maps is proposed. The proposed scheme has got three stages of authentication. Depending upon the level of security desired, users could opt for one or two or three stages. After the initial password creation, users could increase or decrease the number of stages at any time and they could also change the selected password in any particular stage. User studies were conducted on the proposed system to test its usability and memorability. © 2005 - 2014 JATIT & LLS. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Cyclophosphamide is a commercially popular chemotherapeutic drug and is used in the treatment of malignant and non-malignant forms of cancer. Action of hepatic microsomal enzymes on cyclophosphamide metabolizes it into phosphoramide mustard and acrolein. These are toxic and are majorly found to have adverse effects on the kidney and liver causing symptoms like dypsia, fibrosis, hemorrhagic cystitis and necropsis. Acrolein-one of the metabolites was found to interact with majority of biomolecules like DNA, RNA and proteins that may lead to cellular apoptosis. Cyclophosphamide metabolism was also known to induce the production of reactive oxygen species leading to total cellular damage, which causes various acute and chronic diseases. Herbal plants are found to be rich in antioxidant and have anticancerous and tumor reducing properties. Present study aimed in achieving modulatory action of the poly-herbal combination BC and vitamin E on cyclophosphamide induced hepato- and uro-toxicity. Wistar rats (male and female) were treated orally with the 100 mg/kg of the BC and 50 mg/kg of Vit-E for whole of the study (30 days). 200 mg/kg of cyclophosphamide was administered in 2 split doses through i.p. on day 20 and 21. Serum was used to analyze the clinical chemistry parameters such as total protein, albumin, bilirubin (total and direct), urea, creatinine and enzymes like AST and ALT. Parameters that were significantly altered due to cyclophosphamide administration were modulated during treatment using BC + Vit-E (BCE). By these preliminary studies, it has been hypothesized that the effects of cyclophosphamide were treated to a great extent and therapeutic effect of cyclophosphamide has been sensitized by BCE.},

abstract={Diamine oxidase is a copper-containing enzyme with interesting structural dynamics sensitive to environmental conditions. The present work explores the applicability of the system as a tunable platform for the shape and size selective synthesis of zinc oxide nanoparticles under ambient conditions. Significant changes in the nanoscale morphology of ZnO have been observed, using scanning electron microscopy, with respect to changes in pH and gas atmosphere of the medium. More specifically, hexagonal plates of nanoscale ZnO were formed at pH below the isoelectric point of the enzyme and spherical particles at alkaline pH. Interestingly the average particle size of ZnO nanostructures increases with increasing oxygen content at acidic pH while the opposite trend is noticed at alkaline pH. The observations are explained on the basis of changes in the enzyme's surface charge, conformation and redox potential using a combination of techniques like zeta potential measurements, FTIR spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, open circuit potential studies and cyclic voltammetry. Thus the present work demonstrates the applicability of an enzyme as a dynamic bio-template for the synthesis of a multitude of ZnO nanostructures which are expected to add newer insight into bottom-up fabrication of oxide nanostructures. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Water contains a certain amount of oxygen dissolved in it and the relative measure of this oxygen is called as Dissolved Oxygen (DO). The dissolved oxygen content in water can be increased by the process of aeration. The efficiency of oxygen transfer depends on many factors including bubble dimension, flow rate and nozzle diameter. Surface and subsurface aerations are two types of aerations. In the former, aeration is done by exposing water in the form of droplets or thin sheets to air and in the latter air in the form of small bubbles is allowed to rise through water. The objective of this study is to study subsurface aeration and the effect of variation in bubble size, superficial velocity, flow rate and nozzle diameter on the dissolved oxygen content in the sample of water taken. This is done by precipitating a small amount of salt in water by dissolving oxygen and measuring the amount of salt in the water before and after aeration. The bubble dimensions are calculated using image processing techniques. The results show that bubbles of smaller size with maximized surface area, take more time to reach the surface, increasing the residence time of each bubble in the water, allowing a better oxygen transfer rate. © 2014 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

abstract={A facile method was reported for preparing silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) based on naturally occurring N-acylethanolamine (NAE) as a capping agent and sodium borohydride as a reducing agent. NAEs have been found in the infracted areas of canine myocardium and ischemic brain tissues. AgNPs prepared by N-steroylethanolamine (NSEA) are very stable and can be reliably and reproducibly synthesized. These particles have a capability to selective colorimetric sensing of the potentially hazardous Hg2+ ion in water at micromolar concentration. The proposed method was successfully employed for the determination of Hg2+ ion in blood plasma and also in various water bodies, such as tap water, pond water and sewage water. Further, degradation of hazardous organic pollutant, methylene blue dye, was explored using NSEA-AgNPs as catalyst. Besides selective sensing of Hg2+ and degrading hazardous dye, NSEA-AgNPs also shows excellent catalytic activity in the reduction of nitro aromatics. In addition, NSEA-AgNPs shows bactericidal effect in Gram-positive and Gram negative test bacteria, for which the values of minimum inhibitory concentration were determined and reported. In summary, the NSEA-AgNPs reported in this work was a promising candidate for versatile application, such as a sensor, antimicrobial and catalyst. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Conventional non-pilot distance relaying schemes having the facility of series compensated transmission line were found to fail in providing requisite protection to the transmission line during phase faults. A new novel distance relaying scheme is proposed to mitigate the misinterpretations that occur in the conventional methods due to the capacitor used, infeed/outfeedsources, pre-fault system condition, non -linear behaviour of Metal Oxide Varistor(MOV) and arc resistance The proposed method provides an elaborate study of the apparent impedance seen from its relaying point and measures the accurate value of impedance of the faulted line using symmetrical components of voltages and currents. This method has been validated through the simulations carried out on a 400 kV, doubly fed 300 km series compensated long transmission line using MATLAB/SIMULINK software. Finally an evaluation is done by comparing the conventional and the new proposed scheme is done and effectiveness of the proposed method is inferred.},

abstract={Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) stabilized with different surfactants, SDS, PEG, PVA, PVP, PSS and T-80, were synthesized and explored for cysteine colorimetric sensing and catalytic properties. The sensing and catalysis studies revealed an interesting observation that AuNP surfaces covered with linear molecules, SDS and PEG, did not show any colorimetric sensing and exhibited the lowest catalytic effect. Whereas moderately improved sensing and catalysis was observed with AuNPs covered with smaller functional group-substituted PVA and PVP. Interestingly, a selective and robust colour change for cysteine (10 -7 M) in aqueous solution as well as the strongest catalytic effects were observed with AuNPs covered with bulky functional group-substituted PSS and highly branched T-80. These differences could be attributed to the surface accessibility of the AuNPs for the analytes. HR-TEM analysis of T-80-AuNPs with cysteine clearly showed the formation of smaller aggregates of AuNPs. Importantly, T-80-AuNPs showed selective sensing of cysteine across a wide pH range (2.0-10.0). PSS-AuNPs showed selective colorimetric sensing only in the pH range of 6.0 to 10. These studies suggest that the surface capping molecule structure plays a very significant role in both colorimetric sensing and catalysis by AuNPs. © 2014 The Partner Organisations.},

Drilling this kind of composite materials is usually associated with a major problem known as delamination, a mode of failure in composite material which leads to poor dimensional stability, surface roughness and long term performance deterioration. This study is focused to minimise the delamination by the optimal set of drilling parameters such as drill bit material, drill bit diameter, spindle speed and feed rate during drilling chopped strand mat GFRP. Using Taguchi's L9 orthogonal array design, the experiments were conducted and the data obtained were analysed using signal-to-noise ratio to identify the optimal drilling conditions and analysis of variance to find the significance of the drilling parameters. The predicted value was checked by conducting a confirmation test and the results showed a good agreement between predicted and actual value of delamination.

CoAP chooses the two-layered approach, to deal with interchanging of messages. The IOT involves implementing the programming in the Representational State Transfer (REST) model paradigm, which is predominantly inherited by the CoAP protocol. The CoAP proxy adapts a backend framework in a modular form. Also, the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) overcomes unreliable nature in the CoAP due to the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). The CoAP protocol is studied from different angle with respect to the prominent aspects for implementation of IOT in a real world.},

The effective microbes (EMs) were used as a fertilizer and their effect on peroxidase, catalase, super oxide dismutase, protein, chlorophyll a, b and total Chlorophyll were analyzed. The phytoextraction potential of both plants was compared by providing chromium alone and chromium with EMs. The antioxidant enzymes increased in chromium treated plants and slightly decreased by the application of EMs. Fertilizer application reduces the chromium accumulation in roots and shoots slightly and thereby prevents oxidative damage in the plants. The level of plant pigments was much affected by metal treatment but brought back to normalcy by the treatment with EMs. It has been concluded that Z. mays has a high metal accumulating capacity than V. radiata and EMs help plants to survive in metal toxicity and in phytoremediation technology. © 2013 The National Academy of Sciences, India.},

abstract={Energy efficient modeling is a major issue in the wireless sensor network. The main solution for energy efficient routing is by means of clustering. This paper proposes an unequal clustering approach in the networks for even energy distribution. It also reduces the overall energy consumption which in turn improves the network lifetime. The simulation is carried out in MATLABR2010a. The energy needed for entire operations for one round using the proposed method is lesser than that of LEACH, an equal clustering methodology.},

To the best of our knowledge, until now there is no rigorous Legendre wavelets solution has been reported for the NW and AC equations. The highest derivative in the differential equation is expanded into Legendre series, this approximation is integrated while the boundary conditions are applied using integration constants. With the help of Legendre wavelets operational matrices, the aforesaid equations are converted into an algebraic system. Block pulse functions are used to investigate the Legendre wavelets coefficient vectors of nonlinear terms. The convergence of the proposed methods is proved. Finally, we have given some numerical examples to demonstrate the validity and applicability of the method. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Turn-off fluorescence of organic fluorophore, 2-{[4-(2H-Naphtho[1,2-d][1,2, 3]triazol-2-yl)-phenyl]carboxylic acid (NTPC), with metal ions (Fe3+, Cu2+, Pb2+) was converted into turn-on fluorescent sensor for biologically important Zn2+, Cu2+ and Fe3+ metal ions in aqueous solution at ppb level by exploiting strong fluorescence quenching phenomena of metal nanoparticles when organic fluorophores assembled in the vicinity of metallic surface. Amino acid attached phenolic ligands (L) were used as reducing as well as functional capping agents in the synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). The hydrogen bonding functionality of L facilitated the assembling of NTPC in the vicinity of metallic surfaces that leads to complete quenching of NTPC fluorescence. The strong and selective coordination of L with metal ions (Zn2+, Cu2+ and Fe 3+) separates the NTPC from the AgNPs surface that turn-on the NTPC fluorescence. HR-TEM and absorption studies confirm the metal coordination with L and separation of NTPC from the AgNPs surface. Mn2+ showed selective red shifting of NTPC fluorescence after 12 h with all sample. Effects of different amino acid attached phenolic ligands were explored in the metal ion sensitivity and selectivity. This approach demonstrates the multifunctional utility of metal NPs in the development of turn-on fluorescence sensor for paramagnetic heavy metal ions in aqueous solution.

abstract={Unfolding pathways of Pseudomonas aeruginosa cytochrome c551 (Pa cyt c) characterized by native state hydrogen-deuterium exchange (NS H/D) methods in conjunction with multi-dimensional NMR techniques have been reported in the literature. Based on the analyses carried out on the H/D exchange data, it has been shown that there are four submolecular unfolding units or three cryptic intermediates (CIs) of the protein under native conditions. However, OneG, a computational tool for mapping out foldons of proteins, predicted that there is no possible existence of CIs in the protein unfolding but revealed possible existence of metastable states in the protein. The discrepancy in the protein unfolding detected by the NS H/D exchange methods and OneG computational tool has been rationalized through the structural architecture of the protein and differences in the free energy exchange of isotherms representing each cooperative unfolding units identified by the NS H/D exchange methods. Based on comprehensive analyses of data from the two methods, we herein demonstrate that the OneG tool is highly reliable and robust on identifying cryptic intermediates and metastable states that may presumably exist in the unfolding kinetics of proteins under native conditions.},

abstract={Slurry Infiltrated Fibrous Concrete (SIFCON) is a special type of fibre concrete with high fibre content. The matrix usually consists of cement slurry or flowing mortar. Cement content in the slurry leads to greater heat of hydration, higher shrinkage and high production cost. Partial replacement of cement with flyash brings down the above mentioned draw backs. The aim of the present work is to study the effect of fly ash and fiber content on mechanical properties of SIFCON and to arrive the optimum percentage of flyash and fiber content. An experimental investigation was carried out to study the mechanical properties of fly ash based SIFCON by replacing cement with 10, 20 and 30% of flyash. Fiber content in SIFCON is varied as 6, 8 and 10%. The results are compared with control specimen. It is concluded that fly ash based SIFCON were positively affected the results for every percentage replacement of fly ash. The results indicated that the replacement of cement with fly ash decreased the compressive strength and addition of steel fibers developed marginal increase in strength. © 2014 Knowledgia Review, Malaysia.},

abstract={The construction industry in India has a share of about 8% of its GDP and provides employment to around 35 million people. A lot of research has been done to find and analyse workers productivity in Indian construction industry. Research on workers' productivity in construction related activities were limited to large and medium sized projects. This study aims at analysing labour productivity and relation between direct work and their productivity in small construction projects. This industry of small construction projects is labour intensive. The studies incorporated interviews with on-site personnel, work sampling, work measurement and direct observations of different activities. Productivity of different activities was measured directly by measuring actual works at site. Work sampling was used to measure percentage of direct work. The study shows that the percentage of direct work, indirect work and no work was varying between 32-44.6, 40-44 and 15-20%, respectively. It was also found that productivity was higher for the sites where percentage of direct work was higher. The study reveals a huge scope in productivity improvement by reducing no work and indirect work proportion of workers effort at site. © 2014 Knowledgia Review, Malaysia.},

abstract={Compressive strength of concrete mainly depends on the composition, size of the components, water content ratio, curing conditions etc. The 28 days strength is usually taken as reference strength. To find this, a moist curing of concrete specimen for 28 days is required. For economical construction, the 28 days strength is required well in advance and accelerated curing techniques are helpful to some extent. In the conventional accelerated curing, conduction of heat takes place from surface to the core of the concrete specimen and hence there exist a temperature gradient, leading to thermal stress in concrete. In this study, microwave radiation energy is used for accelerated curing in which the temperature change is uniform through out the concrete. The concrete cubes were cured with microwave energy after 6, 18 and 24 h of delay time of M30 grade concrete. Different microwave energy levels (360, 540, 720, 900 W) and microwave curing durations (20, 30, 40, 50 min) were used. The compressive strength developed after the microwave curing is compared with the 28 days strength estimated with the usual procedure. The results obtained were suitably plotted as graphs so that the graphs can be used to estimate the 28 days strength from the early strength obtained by microwave curing. The results of the study show the potential and scope for further research with different grade of concrete. © 2014 Knowledgia Review, Malaysia.},

abstract={Concrete has been widely used as construction material for most of important structures worldwide. Age of many of these structures has reached the end of their service life. Necessity arises for repair and rehabilitation to strengthen these structures. A technique used for strengthening concrete structures is retrofitting. In present study retrofitting is done by wrapping the cylinder specimens with Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymer sheet (GFRP) using binders. Two types of binder are used namely organic epoxy and inorganic cementitious composites. Generally epoxy has a good bonding capacity to strengthen the structures. The demerit of epoxy is its incompatibility with the base concrete. To overcome this Difficulty Mineral Based Composites (MBC) are being used. The retrofitting of damaged specimens gives a clear view of effect of strengthening in terms of restoration to original strength. Study focuses on the comparison of stress strain behaviour of control and retrofitted damaged cylinders obtained using above mentioned two binders. It is concluded that compressive strength and stiffness for concrete members using inorganic binders are comparable with epoxy binders in bringing back the specimens to original strength apart from being non hazardous. It is also inferred that strength increases with increase in number of layers of wrapping. The reduction in strength due to mineral based binders could be increased by adding fibers in composites namely engineered cementitious composites. © 2014 Knowledgia Review, Malaysia.},

abstract={The increasing worldwide production of cement to meet the future development in the infrastructure industry indicates the concrete is the most important ingredient in the modern construction materials. It is well evident that production of Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) not only consumes larger quantity of natural resources but also emits larger quantity of carbon dioxide gas to the atmosphere. An effort has been taken to reduce the emission of carbon dioxide gas and also to produce an environment friendly material in the development of inorganic alumino silicate polymer called geopolymer, which is obtained from materials of geological origin or a byproduct materials such as fly ash, Silica fume, Ground Granulated Blast furnace Slag (GGBS) along with alkaline liquid. Geopolymer concrete (GPC) is a new innovative eco-friendly material which can be produced by partial replacement of cement in ordinary concrete by a mineral admixture such as Silica fume, Fly ash and Ground Granulated Blast furnace Slag along with alkaline liquid. In this study an attempt has been made to produce silica fume based geopolymer concrete and to find out its strength characteristics by considering the parameters such as ratio of alkaline liquid to silica fume, ratio of silicate to hydroxide and for different ages of geopolymer concrete with constant percentage of silica fume. The experiments were conducted to study the above mentioned parameters. From the results it is understood that with AL/SF = 0.25, SiO3/OH = 0.5, for thermal curing temperature of 60°C, for curing period of 56 days and 60% replacements of silica fume, yielded better compressive strength when compared to conventional concrete under normal curing. Hence use of silica fume based geopolymer concrete is recommended for construction. © 2014 Knowledgia Review, Malaysia.},

abstract={There is always a concern on the interaction between various mineral and chemical admixtures with fibre reinforced concrete. To find a suitable concrete material by using1 all these substances, firstly study the interaction among them and their effects on the strength of that concrete. Thus, in this study an experimental test was conducted on silica fume based fibre reinforced concrete with chemical admixtures. The main intention of this study was to find effect of fibre reinforced concrete prepared with mineral admixture on various chemical admixtures. The mineral admixture used was silica fume, fibre used was dramix steel fibre and the chemical admixtures used were accelerator, super-plasticizer and air-entraining agent. The optimum dosage of these admixtures with and without including silica fume and steel fibre was found out and tests were conducted on 3, 7 and 28 days. The results indicated that addition of accelerator with silica fume and steel fibre increased the compressive strength significantly with a marginal increase in tensile strength. On the addition of super-plasticizer with silica fume and steel fibre, a greater reduction in w/c ratio could be achieved without compromising the strength. In the combination with air-entraining agent, the strength was affected faintly at the initial stage but in later stage, the expected strength was attained. © 2014 Knowledgia Review, Malaysia.},

abstract={Moringa oleifera is a multipurpose medicinal food of dietary interest known to have health beneficial effects, and has been used as a possible ayurvedic medicine. This study was carried out to investigate the effects of H2O2 induced apoptosis, that measure cellular proliferation, viability, and morphological changes and to investigate if the dietary leaf extract could inhibit the oxidative stress events and the mechanism against the oxidative assaulted biomolecular targets, which simultaneously contributes to the understanding of cellular responses associated. H2O2 induced oxidative stress in yeast cells was assayed with parameters like cell viability, apoptotic morphological and nuclear changes and the antioxidant enzyme levels. The formation of TBARS was also assayed. H2O2 imposed oxidative damage in yeast cells resulted in a sequence of events characteristic of apoptosis, including loss of cell viability, morphological changes and apoptotic nuclear changes. There was a decrease in the levels of antioxidant enzymes, and an increase in the lipid peroxide formation. The presence of the leaf extracts attenuated the oxidative stress and significantly enhanced the levels of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT). The leaf extracts caused a very significant inhibition of the extent of lipid peroxide formation and further showed a significant hydroxyl radical scavenging activity. The leaf extracts were characterized for the active principles and quercetin glucoside and keampferol rhamnoglucoside were identified in the ethanol leaf extracts. Additionally the leaf extracts also suppressed the effects against H2O2 induced apoptotic cellular changes. These results suggest the valuable use of Moringa oleifera leaves, consumed as leafy vegetable, can provide potential functional nutrients that can help in the prevention of oxidative stress disorders.},

abstract={Slurry Infiltrated Fibrous Concrete (SIFCON) is a high volume Fibre Reinforced Concrete (FRC) with significant improvement in the properties such as strength, durability, ductility and toughness. Fibre reinforced concrete has a wide variety of structural application, in which the ductility depends on the amount of fibres present in the concrete. This work reports on the experimental study concerning the flexural behavior of Slurry Infiltrated Fibrous Concrete (SIFCON) composite beams and to investigate the influence of volume percentage of SIFCON on strength and stiffness characteristics of Reinforced Cement Concrete (RCC) and fibre reinforced concrete beams under flexural loading. A total of thirteen beams with an effective span of 1000 mm were casted and tested to study the load deformation characteristics, ductility related parameters, ultimate moment capacity and failure criteria. The reinforced cement concrete and fibre reinforced concrete beams were casted with partial replacement with SIFCON in the tension zone. The effect of various volume of SIFCON (10, 20, 30, 40 and 50%) in the beam on the flexural strength was investigated. The beams were evaluated for flexural strength, compositeness between RCC and FRC with SIFCON under static loading. Herein, full SIFCON, full RCC and full FRC beams were also examined for comparison. The results illustrate that the composite beams holds improved flexural strength, deflection resistance behavior and performed comparatively with full SIFCON. The RCC composite beam has the strength of 25% more than the conventional concrete beam, whereas the FRC composite shows an increase of 45%. © 2014 Knowledgia Review, Malaysia.},

abstract={Concrete plays a very important role in infrastructure development like buildings, bridges and industrial structures etc. Long term performance of buildings without deterioration helps economies of nation. High Performance Concrete (HPC) is one which shows special performance than normal concrete. This necessitates use of mineral and chemical admixtures to improve concrete performance. In this study an attempt has been made to study strength and durability characteristics of M60 grade concrete by partial replacing natural sand and cement with ROBO Sand (crusher dust) and Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBFS), respectively. Experiments were conducted with different percentage replacements of sand of 40, 60 and 80% and cement of 40, 50 and 60% with ROBO sand and GGBFS, respectively. There were 16 combinations of mixes studied for its compressive strength and short term durability characteristics such as resistance against acid and sulphate attack. Finally, it was observed that the specimens with combination of GGBFS and ROBO sand for 40% had the optimum compressive strength and resistance against sulphate, acid attack as a result it can be concluded that replacement of cement and sand with GGBFS and ROBO sand improved the strength and resistance against sulphate and acid attack of the concrete compared to control concrete. © 2014 Knowledgia Review, Malaysia.},

abstract={The first set of competitive inhibitors of molt inhibiting hormone (MIH) has been developed using the effective approaches such as Hip-Hop, virtual screening and manual alterations. Moreover, the conserved residues at 71 and 72 positions in the molt inhibiting hormone is known to be significant for selective inhibition of ecdysteroidogenesis; thus, the information from mutation and solution structure were used to generate common pharmacophore features. The geometry of the final six-feature pharmacophore was also found to be consistent with the homology-modeled MIH structures from various other decapod crustaceans. The Hypo-1, comprising six features hypothesis was carefully selected as a best pharmacophore model for virtual screening created on the basis of rank score and cluster processes. The hypothesis was validated and the database was virtually screened using this 3D query and the compounds were then manually altered to enhance the fit value. The hits obtained were further filtered for drug-likeness, which is expressed as physicochemical properties that contribute to favorable ADME/Tox profiles to eliminate the molecules exhibit toxicity and poor pharmacokinetics. In conclusion, the higher fit values of CI-1 (4.6), CI-4 (4.9) and CI-7 (4.2) in conjunction with better pharmacokinetic profile made these molecules practically helpful tool to increase production by accelerating molt in crustaceans. The use of feeding sub-therapeutic dosages of these growth enhancers can be very effectively implemented and certainly turn out to be a vital part of emerging nutritional strategies for economically important crustacean livestock.},

abstract={The present study explains elaborately the use of ground and unground micro-silica with concrete in 5, 10 and 15% as a partial substitute to cement and results were compared with conventional concrete. Micro-Silica was ground in ball mill using iron balls of 15 mm diameter and the sizes of the ground samples were checked after 4, 6 and 8 h of grinding by Particle Size Analyzer (PSA). Concrete specimens containing ground and unground micro-silica were cast in the laboratory and tested for compressive and tensile strengths at different ages of concrete. Permeability test was conducted after subjecting the specimens to 28 days curing. The morphology of the unground micro-silica and micro-silica ground for different time durations were analyzed using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). More irregular shapes were observed after 6 h of grinding so the grinding h were restricted to a maximum of 8 h. From the results it was observed that the specimens cast with micro-silica ground for 6 h, added 5% as a partial replacement for cement showed strength improvement up to 30% compared to the specimens cast with unground micro-silica. The resistance to permeability was also higher in concrete specimens cast using micro-silica ground for 6 h as a partial replacement for cement. So, it is inferred from the results that for an optimum grinding period of 6 h, ultra-fine micro-silica can be obtained. Optimum percentage of partial substitution for cement was found to be 5% in terms of strength and durability characteristics of concrete. © 2014 Knowledgia Review, Malaysia.},

abstract={Teak Leaf Powder (TLP) was used as adsorbent for Methylene Blue (MB) adsorption and its kinetics was investigated. Effects of parameters like solution dye concentration, pH, solution temperature, amount of adsorbent and particle size on MB adsorption onto TLP were examined. Methylene blue adsorption onto TLP was favoured at pH greater than its pHzpc, 7.2. Experimental data were found to follow the pseudo second order kinetics. Influence of Temperature (T) and the dimensionless ratio of initial concentration to adsorbent concentration (N) on kinetics of MB adsorption onto TLP were examined using multivariate regression analysis. A quadratic model was proposed to express the kinetic rate constant as a function of these variables. Statistical tools like Student's t-test, F-test and ANOVA were used to identify the statistical significance of coefficients included in the model. It was found that the main effect of T, main effect of N, the second order effect of T were statistically significant. The model predicted the rate constant with high R2 value 95.3%. It was found that the rate constant decreased with increase in N and increased with increase in T. © 2014 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

abstract={Electrophoretic separation of membrane proteins is limited mainly by their intrinsic hydrophobicity and poor solubility arising from association with membrane lipid components. In this investigation, polyacrylamide gel matrix is made hydrophobic by introducing one-dimensional and two-dimensional carbon nanomaterials viz., multi-walled carbon nanotubes and graphene. The nanocomposite matrices were optimized for SDS-PAGE with water-soluble molecular weight marker proteins. SDS-PAGE in the nanocomposite matrices of a commercial outer membrane porin protein, OmpA indicated a significant decrease in anomalous migration of the protein with increasing carbon nanotube loading in the gel matrix. Outer membrane proteins of Escherichia coli, were isolated and characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. When the nanocomposite gels were tested for electrophoretic separation of outer membrane proteins isolated from E. coli, the resolution of protein bands improved with respect to the pristine polyacrylamide gel. Especially, graphene/polyacrylamide composite hydrogels yielded far better resolution and faster migration of the E. coli membrane proteins compared to multi-walled carbon nanotube/polyacrylamide composite hydrogels. Based on contact angle measurements of the composite hydrogels, the improved resolution of membrane proteins is attributed to the more hydrophobic environment rendered by carbon nanotubes and graphene. The present results could be useful to develop more hydrophobic nanocomposite gels exclusively for electrophoretic separation of membrane proteins isolated from different sources. © 2014 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

abstract={Titanium Nitride (TiN) is an interstitial nitride with remarkable hardness, adhesion and toughness making it ideal for thin film applications. In this work the effect of substrate bias and substrate temperature on crystallinity, morphology, hydroph obi city and adhesion of TiN films has been studied. The films were deposited by dc magnetron sputtering on well-cleaned substrates of glass, silicon (100) and stainless steel (AISISS304). The deposited films were analysed using X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM), contact angle measurement and scratch testing. Grains with globular and columnar morphology were formed and the films were predominantly hydrophilic in nature. In the absence of substrate bias amorphous films were formed and (111) and (200) planes appeared with substrate heating and bias. Improved adhesion was observed at lower bias and higher temperatures. © 2014 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

abstract={Molecular self-assembly of peptides have gained attention in the recent years due to the reproducibility of nanostructures that are formed with a high degree of control over the kinetics of formation. These self-assembled nanostructures have been widely exploited for drug delivery, tissue engineering and also serve as model systems to understand the pathogenesis behind protein misfolding diseases. In our study, an attempt has been made to understand the pathogenesis behind the formation of amyloid plaques using a modified version of the KLVFF peptide. The self-assembly of the RIVFF peptide was investigated in various substrates and at different pH. Our data revealed that the novel pentapeptide RIVFF self assembles into micelles of about 10 nm, which was confirmed by electron microscopy. The presence of hydrogen bonded beta sheet structures in the micelles was confirmed using FTIR, SAED, CD and thioflavin binding assay. The formation of higher order structures by the peptide at various pH and substrates was investigated using SEM. Finally the mode of action of the micelles formed by the peptide was confirmed by cytotoxicity studies in IMR-32 human neuroblastoma cell lines. The cytotoxicity of the nanostructures formed by the peptide may be attributed to the amino acids with long side chains along with hydrophobic amino acids resembling the cytotoxicity of amyloid beta peptide. © 2014 the Partner Organisations.},

abstract={In recent years significant research has been done in the field of facial recognition. Face recognition forms the heart of biometrics. There are lots of techniques available for recognizing the human face and ear biometrics is the newborn child, taking into account the uniqueness of human ear. Various algorithms are in existence for the face recognition system such as capturing iris pattern, extracting the skull; etc.But the detailed analysis of these algorithms depicts high cost results. Although the algorithm proves to be efficient, the cost factor adds demerits to the system, so systems with low cost and high efficiency are in demand. Studies of various unique parts in human face lead to the selection of ear lobe analysis which is part of Ear biometrics. Our work aims at recognizing the human face automatically by capturing the pattern of ear lobe. The side view of the person is captured and the ear lobe feature is captured and the ear lobe feature is extracted using ear shape model based approach. The extracted image is converted into gray-scale image and image enhancement techniques such as pixel brightening, edge extraction and clustering are applied to enhance the brightness of the pixels which is then converted into corresponding binary representation and stored into the database. The same procedure is applied to recognize the face by comparing the captured image with the stored one. Once the appropriate match is found in the database, the respective face is displayed as output. © Research India Publications.},

It has also been accepted by researchers that OCB as a phenomenon is subjective to the national culture. Substantial organization studies have been directed towards comprehending and appreciating OCB as a dependent variable. The researchers hypothesized that Job Satisfaction (JS) would be strongly related to OCB. Hence the two primary objective of this study was to explore the conceptual dimensions of the OCB construct in the Indian context and secondly to investigate on JS as an antecedent of OCB. The cognitive measure of JS adopted in this study was confirmed to be positively correlated with the four dimensions of OCB namely, altruism, courtesy, conscientiousness and civic virtue. The extrinsic factors of JS were more strongly correlated to OCB than the intrinsic factors. © Maxwell Scientific Organization, 2014.},

Every advancement has its own intrinsic worth and frailties. Millions of credit card transactions are processed each day. Increases in online shoppers in turn provide more opportunities for credit card usage, which is directly proportional to commit deception. The dearth of tracking fraudulent credit card transactions is due to the increase in white-collar criminals. The way out to this problem is tracked by the behavioral pattern of the customer by implementing the Classifiers Naïve Bayesian and Random Forest to predict the legitimate and fraudulent patterns. The proposed method builds personalize and aggregate model to predict deceitful transactions. Since individual's transactional behavior varies from one another, there comes the need for personalize and aggregate model. The aggregate model performs better than personalized model.

abstract={Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate quorum quenching and antibacterial activity of silver nanoparticles synthesized from medicinal plants against Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Methods: Development of efficient methods for green synthesis of silver nanoparticles using plant extracts has become a major focus area of nanotechnology. The importance of bactericidal nanomaterials is gaining due to the increased resistant strains of bacteria against most potent antibiotics. The discovery of bacterial communication system (Quorum-sensing system), which orchestrate important temporal events during the infection process, has afforded a novel opportunity to ameliorate bacterial infection by means other than growth inhibition. This has promoted research in the well-known bactericidal activity of Ag+ ions and Ag-based compounds, including silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). In this study, extracellular biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles was carried out using aqueous extracts of nine different herbal plant leaves for the reduction of aqueous silver ions. The morphologies and structures of the nanoparticles were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, UV-visible spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. Furthermore, the synthesized AgNPs were evaluavated for quorum quenching and antibacterial activity against MRSA. Results: Among the nine selected medicinal plant leaf extracts Aerva lanata showed rapid reduction (2 min) of silver ions in the solution. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis revealed the nanocrystalline phase of silver with the average particles size ranged from 37-47 nm and has spherical shape. Furthermore the synthesized AgNPs exhibited very effective antibacterial activity against Methicillin Resistance Staphylococus aureus (MRSA). Moreover, the stable silver nanoparticles found to inhibit violacein production, a quorum sensing regulated behavior in Chromobacterium violaceum CV026. Conclusion: The presence of surface active molecules such as flavonoids, terpenoids in the plant leaves extracts stabilize the silver nanoparticles. Furthermore the green synthesized AgNPs established very effective antibacterial and quorum quenching activity against MRSA.},

abstract={Insulating barriers utilized in complex high voltage insulation systems has been exploited widely by manufacturers of power apparatus. Barriers have found utility in a variety of power apparatus for protection against direct lightning strokes, as an interface at the boundaries of composite insulation materials etc. Though investigations have been carried out by researchers on the breakdown characteristics, barrier position in the gap, influence of space charge etc these characteristics have been analyzed based on aspects pertinent to classical testing procedures only. Advent of high speed switching devices in power systems provides avenues to investigate the effect of insulation performance due to High Frequency High Voltage (HFHV) also. Further, uncharacteristic failures in oil filled distribution transformers have been reported indicated fast transients as the major cause for failures which was not revealed during classical laboratory testing. This research focuses on the influence and effects of solid insulating barriers placed in transformer oil due to HFHV in inhomogeneous fields. Test cell arrangement has been fabricated for carrying out experimental investigations to adhere international standards. Exhaustive experimentation has been performed to infer the influence of the position of barrier, nature of field and breakdown voltage, erosion characteristics of the barrier at an appropriate range of frequencies. A detailed comparison between HFHV and classical power frequency voltage has been carried out. The nature of ionization at the barrier interface and the subsequent increase in the breakdown voltage as explained by Double Electric Layer (DEL) theory has been cross validated. In addition, a study has also been carried out to assess and characterize the ageing of oil based on Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) analysis using Weibull distribution.},

abstract={In this work, a combination of Economic and Emission power dispatch optimization is solved by differential evolution technique using MAT-lab programming technique. The crux of the objective is to find the economic scheduling of the generation, such that the required load demands of the generation can be satisfied and the operation such as equality and inequality constraints of the generators including the total emissions within the allowable emission limit for satisfactory operation of the thermal power plant. In this work only one emission of Nitrogen oxide is considered for analysis. The economic/environmental load dispatch is analyzed in two cases. Case one deals excluding transmission losses and case two deals including transmission losses in the system. The standard data of IEEE Thirty Bus System and Indian Utility Sixty Two Bus Test System has been taken into account and simulated with aid of MAT-lab software and results are obtained. An apposite program has been developed using differential evolution technique and which has been verified for various load demand.},

The presented method implements the dead-time elimination mostly in the basic period of the load current but moves to the traditional method of compensating dead-time during the zero-crossing point. By this approach, a proficient method of eliminating dead-time effect is attained and output RMS value is regained. No particular hardware circuit for detection is needed in this technique. Simulation results are specified to express the qualities of this new technique. © Research India Publications.},

Smart grid technology is a new emerging methodology to utilize the electrical energy efficiently. Electrical power is sent at high voltages through lines and distributed to consumers at low voltages. The transformer plays crucial role in the overall process. When Oil filled transformers are subjected to sudden variation in loads, these situations enhance the occurrence of internal faults. An oil sensor and a microcontroller arrangement are used to monitor the condition of the oil. In case, when an internal fault occurs it makes the relay circuit to trip the transformer from the three phase bus bar, thereby alerting the operator for servicing the transformer by sending an SMS to his mobile. © Research India Publications.},

The essence of this paper lies in transmitting an image using Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) system without causing considerable harm to Signal to Noise ratio SNR and Bit Error Rate BER. In the proposed work two different types of interleaver and equalizer are taken for consideration. Effectiveness regarding WCDMA system based on Maximum Likelihood Sequence Estimator (MLSE) and Least Mean Square Error (LMSE) equalizer has been examined. Rake receiver with five fingers additionally made to enhance the effectiveness simply by improving the system immunity against noise and other attributes that degrade the system behavior. Further different images with different sizes are also transmitted through the suggested system setup. Experimental results shows the elevation in system performance in terms of PSNR and BER. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Experiments were performed on the preparation and characterization of CuO-propylene glycol nanofluids. The influence of nanoparticle concentration and temperature on nanofluid viscosity reveals existence of a range of nanoparticle concentration and temperature in which the viscosity of nanofluid is lower than that of propylene glycol, possibly due to interactions between nanoparti-cles and propylene glycol. A temperature-independent, thermal conductivity enhancement of 38% was obtained for nanoparticle concentration of 1.5 vol% over a temperature range of 10-60 °C. We believe that particle clustering contributes to the thermal conductivity enhancement in CuO-propylene glycol nanofluids. Copyright © 2014 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.},

abstract={An advanced understanding of neurohormonal activation and inhibition of numerous functions is vital for two important reasons. First, basic research gradually elucidates the mechanisms by which activation of many neurohormonal systems causes further alteration in various gene expressions. Second, pharmacologic agents can be designed and used to interfere with the target specific components of neurohormonal systems. Future approaches will probably emphasize on specific characteristics of neurohormonal systems, comprising targeting neurohormones and the intracellular second messenger systems. Accordingly, the objective of this review is to define the mechanisms of neurohormonal activation of various functions in crustaceans and to deliver a comprehensive description. This review will also serve as a vital reference for researchers by providing the structural and physiological basis for current and future research in the field of crustacean Neurobiology.},

Heart failure continues to be a major contributor to the morbidity and mortality across the globe. This may be attributed to the limited regeneration capacity after the adult cardiomyocytes are terminally differentiated or injured. Various strategies involving acellular scaffolds, stem cells, and combinations of stem cells, scaffolds and growth factors have been investigated for effective cardiac tissue regeneration. Recently, injectable hydrogels have emerged as a potential candidate among various categories of biomaterials for cardiac tissue regeneration due to improved patient compliance and facile administration via minimal invasive mode that treats complex infarction.

abstract={South Indian history is interwoven with rice. Rice is the essential component of food, festival, occupation, birth, and death of every single citizen of Tamil Nadu, as elsewhere in India. Especially in Tamil Nadu, the Cauvery river basin had been renowned as 'Rice Granary of South India '. There had been approximately 400 varieties of rice in vogue since Kingdoms ' Era. An effort has been made to collect names of traditional rice varieties that are still extant and those that had been then household varieties of ancient Tamils. The names had been collected from sources like inscriptions, textual records, literature, personal communications, poems, semi-structured interviews, and oral sayings. The meticulous transliteration efforts have enabled us to understand and appreciate the criteria of naming the traditional varieties of rice primarily on morphological traits of whole plant or inflorescence or grain. The varieties had been clearly distinguished and given names with color, shape, size, and appearance, either as an individual trait or in combination with other characters. This article corroborates the phenomenon of naming of traditional rice by ancient Tamils with the art of naming elsewhere in India as cited in Ayurvedic treatises by Susruta, Taittiriya Samhita of the Black Yajurveda, Paninni's Astadhyayi, and Ramayana. The art of naming is also compared for a range of crops including rice of Lao PDR, enset of Ethiopia, rice of Gambia, etc. Apart from this, the traditional varieties of rice were also given names of persons who had been then heroes, kings, and leaders of their period. About 340 names based on color, appearance or both, size, duration, numbers, special characters, etc. have been listed and tabulated along with transliterated meanings.},

abstract={The paper aims at the authentication of a person in case of criminology for analyzing the contributions of the individual facial shape and texture for face recognition. These components are evaluated to investigate the information to enhance face recognition. The steps of this method mainly focus on three basic techniques namely preprocessing, feature extraction and face recognition using MATLAB. The preprocessing is used to eliminate the noises in the image and used to train the database of the image.The feature extraction determines the database which consists of eigen values and vectors and they are calculated using standard linear methods. The recognition method is robust to noise, pose illumination and expression variations. The previous methods have a defect of pose changes especially in black-white color and thermal image where as in this LLE method Global shading variation will not affect recognition performance. Similarly expression variations are determined notably in large expression areas like mouth differentiates 2D and 3D scans. Unlike previous method the image visible points cannot change either positively or negatively.The non-linearlities of the images are preserved and projected by LPP. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Image encryption plays a major role in information security. It is primarily used to modify the data of an image. It has provided the possibility of transmitting and receiving the image in an efficient manner. In this paper, we propose an improved image encryption using circular budge and shifting the zero frequency of an image. We did a circular budge in random order for transforming the pixels of an image. It provides the encryption based on permuting the bit sequences of an image. It is especially used to keep the privacy of information in the most secure way. Circular shifting is used to rearrange the pixels and reduce the correlation among the pixels of an image to provide an encrypted form. Here we use the combination of circular budge and shifting the zero frequency makes the encryption system more difficult. At last the receiver uses the same inverse process to decrypt the encrypted images. The performance of an image is evaluated in terms of Peak signal to noise ratio and Mean square error. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme is more secure than the other methods. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Tuberculosis, also called TB, is currently a major health hazard due to multidrug-resistant forms of bacilli. Global efforts are underway to eradicate TB using new drugs with new modes of action, higher activity, and fewer side effects in combination with vaccines. For this reason, unexplored new sources and previously explored sources were examined and around 353 antimycobacterial compounds (Nat Prod Rep 2007; 24: 278-297) 7 have been previously reported. To develop drugs from these new sources, additional work is required for preclinical and clinical results. Since ancient times, different plant part extracts have been used as traditional medicines against diseases including tuberculosis. This knowledge may be useful in developing future powerful drugs. Plant natural products are again becoming important in this regard. In this review, we report 127 antimycobacterial compounds and their antimycobacterial activities. Of these, 27 compounds had a minimum inhibitory concentration of < 10 μg/mL. In some cases, the mechanism of activity has been determined. We hope that some of these compounds may eventually develop into effective new drugs against tuberculosis. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart - New York.},

On the other hand, administration of C. pictus extract caused a considerable protection against the oxidative stress which was evident from the reversal of marker enzymes to control level.Similarly,antoxidant enzymes also exhibited marked recovery to the control level.Increased reduced glutathione and reduction in lipid peroxidation were also evident following administration of CPE.This clearly shows that CPE by virtue of its remarkable antioxidant potential protected the liver and kidney against the hyperglycemic oxidative stress.},

abstract={Humic acid (HA) is one of the major components of the natural organic matter present in the environment that alters the fate and behavior of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs). Transformation of Ag NPs happens upon interaction with HA, thereby, changing both physical and chemical properties. Fluorescence spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to analyze the interaction of Ag NPs with HA. In pH and time-dependent studies, the near field electro dynamical environment of Ag NPs influenced the fluorescence of HA, indicated by fluorescence enhancement. SEM revealed not only morphological changes, but also significant reduction in size of Ag NPs after interaction with HA. Based on these studies, a probable mechanism was proposed for the interaction of HA with Ag NPs, suggesting the possible transformation that these nanoparticles can undergo in the environment. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Urban run-off increases significantly due to increased impervious area and reduced drainage network. Evaluation of land use in urban area plays a vital role as input to the estimation of runoff. The hydrological design standard for urban water resources planning and management is commonly based on the frequency of occurrence of heavy rainfall events. In the present study, the occurrence of most frequent heavy rainfall event is investigated for Thanjavur town, located in the State of Tamilnadu, India and used for estimation of run-off depth. The Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (SCS-CN) is used for evaluating run-off depth value for event rainfall starting from 10 mm to 400 mm. The land use detail for the study area was obtained by integration of GIS and remote sensing. The spatial variation of event rainfall is considered with certain percentage of deviation from base rainfall for each triangle area that contributes to the run-off. The results of the analysis indicate that the study area can produce the run-off volume more than that required for urban water management at an average seasonal rainfall. © 2014 JUST.

abstract={Context: Chromobacterium violaceum Bergonzini (Neisseriaceae), a Gram-negative bacterium, secretes a spectacular pigment called violacein. Violacein is a quorum-sensing metabolite and is also an active antimicrobial, anticancer agent. However, its efficiency as a potential drug, alone or in synergy with other active principles, has not being completely exploited. With the advent of different multi-drug resistant strains, it becomes essential to find a new natural product(s) that could be effectively used as a therapeutic agent. Objective: This work focused on the extraction of violacein from an isolated strain of C. violaceum and determined the combinatory effect of violacein with commercial antibiotics against various pathogens. Materials and methods: Violacein production was optimized and was later extracted using ethanol and characterized by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and infrared spectroscopy. Then, individual minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for each of the antibiotics were determined followed by violacein-commercial antibiotics (1:1) combinations, tested at different concentrations starting from 500 to 1μg/ml against major pathogens. Results and discussion: The individual MIC data for violacein was found to be 5.7μg/ml (Staphylococcus aureus), 15.6μg/ml (Klebsiella pneumoniae), 18.5μg/ml (Pseudomonas aeruginosa), 20.0μg/ml (Vibrio cholerae) and 5.7μg/ml (Salmonella typhi). Violacein-gentamicin and violacein-cefadroxil combinations had MIC of 1.0μg/ml against S. aureus. Most violacein-macrolide and violacein - aminoglycoside class combinations revealed fractional inhibitory concentration indices (FICI) of <0.5, thus exhibiting synergism. Furthermore, violacein-azithromycin and violacein-kanamycin combination, exhibited significant synergy (FICI-0.3) against S. typhi. Conclusion: Violacein works synergistically with most commercial antibiotics and could be used as drug in combination with other antimicrobial agents. © 2014 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.},

abstract={Xylanolytic enzyme was produced using a newly isolated Bacillus aerophilus KGJ2 and low cost lignocellulosic sources in solid state fermentation. Seven different agricultural residues (wheat bran, tea dust, saw dust, paper waste, cassava bagasse, rice straw and rice husk) and six nitrogen source namely yeast extract, beef extract, peptone, ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulphate, and ammonium chloride were examined for xylanase production. Upon initial screening, wheat bran and ammonium chloride were chosen as suitable carbon source and nitrogen source respectively. Plackett-Burman fractional factorial design was employed to screen the important process variables affecting enzyme production. Substrate concentration, nitrogen source, moisture content and MgSO4·7H2O were identified as statistically significant variables. Subsequently Box-Behnken method was used to optimize the process conditions to achieve maximum xylanase yield. Under optimized conditions xylanase yield was 45.9U/gds. Best xylanase activity was obtained at 70°C and pH 4.0. It retained more than 90% activity after incubation at 80-90°C for 60min. The hydrolytic efficiency of xylanase on xylan was examined and xylobiose, xylotriose and xylotetrose were obtained as hydrolytic products. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

The nanoribbon of pure InN, oxygen, fluorine and gallium substituted InN nanoribbon and defect InN nanoribbon are studied and analyzed. The band structure of pure InN, oxygen, fluorine and gallium substituted InN shows semiconducting nature whereas defect InN nanoribbon shows a metallic nature. The density of states of InN nanoribbon provides insight for the localization of charges in valence and conduction bands. The transport property are studied in terms of transmission spectrum, pure and gallium substituted InN has almost same transmission, in contrast oxygen and fluorine substituted InN shows a different fashion in transmission spectrum. The presence of defect modifies the transmission that depends on the geometry of the structure and position of the defect in the nanostructure.

abstract={Nanosized silver have been widely used in many applications, such as catalysis, photonics, sensors, medicine etc. Thus, there is an increasing need to develop high-yield, low cost, non-toxic and eco-friendly procedures for the synthesis of nanoparticles. Herein, we report an efficient, green synthesis of silver nanoparticles utilizing the aqueous extract of Salicornia brachiata, a tropical plant of the Chenopodiaceae family. Silver nanoparticles have been characterized by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The morphology of the particles formed consists of highly diversified shapes like spherical, rod-like, prism, triangular, pentagonal and hexagonal pattern. However, addition of sodium hydroxide to the extract produces mostly spherical particles. The stable nanoparticles obtained using this green method show remarkable catalytic activity in the reduction of 4-nitro phenol to 4-amino phenol. The reduction catalyzed by silver nanoparticles followed the first-order kinetics, with a rate constant of, 0.6 × 10-2 s-1. The bactericidal activity of the synthesized silver nanoparticles against the pathogenic bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus aureus E, Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli, was also explored using REMA. The obtained results showed that the minimum inhibitory concentration required to induce bactericidal effect is lower than the control antibiotic, ciprofloxacin. In addition to these, the biogenic synthesized nanoparticles also exhibited excellent free radical scavenging activity. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG) welding is considered as one of the cleanest welding methods. It is generally adopted for thinner materials with moderate weld joint strengths. Welding of sintered porous materials continues to be a challenge due to the inherent porosity of the parent metals. The present research work attempts to address some of the issues relating to the welding behaviour of sintered and forged Fe-0.3%C-3%Mo low alloy steels under TIG welding. Rectangular strips of size 70. mm. ×. 15. mm. ×. 5. mm, obtained by blending, compacting and sintering of elemental powders of iron, graphite and molybdenum, were upset forged - both hot and cold in order to obtain alloy steel strips of various porosities. Two identical alloy steel strips of equal density were then welded both along longitudinal and transverse directions, by TIG welding, employing filler metal of suitable composition. The welded strips were then subjected to tensile test, hardness test, microstructural and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) fractography studies. Cold/hot upsetting of the sintered alloy preforms has led to enhanced density. As a result of improved density, their tensile strength and hardness values were also found to be enhanced. The welded alloy exhibited higher tensile strength compared to the un-welded base metal, due to strengthening by residual stress. Similarly, the strength and hardness of the welded alloy strips were found to be enhanced with increase in density. The tensile strength of welded joint is found to be higher compared to that of the base metal due to alloy metals segregation, rapid cooling and formation of acicular ferrite at the weldment of welded joint.

abstract={Petroleum based products are the major source of energy for industries and daily life. Leaks and accidental spills occur regularly during the exploration, production, refining, transport, and storage of petroleum and petroleum products. In the present study we isolated the bacteria from diesel contaminated soil and screened them for diesel biodegradation capacity. One monoculture isolate identified by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis to be Acinetobacter baumannii was further studied for diesel oil biodegradation. The effects of various culture parameters (pH, temperature, NaCl concentrations, initial hydrocarbon concentration, initial inoculum size, role of chemical surfactant, and role of carbon and nitrogen sources) on biodegradation of diesel oil were evaluated. Optimal diesel oil biodegradation by A. baumanii occurred at initial pH 7, 35°C and initial hydrocarbon concentration at 4%. The biodegradation products under optimal cultural conditions were analyzed by GC-MS. The present study suggests that A. baumannii can be used for effective degradation of diesel oil from industrial effluents contaminated with diesel oil. © 2014 Palanisamy et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) concentrate on the essential problem of increasing the network lifetime of WSN, which are bordered by low capacity batteries1,3 One of the fundamental egresses in WSN is maximizing the network lifetime by mitigating the Hotspot problem. It is the problem of isolation of sink node due to energy diminution of nodes most close-lipped to sink1. In WSN nodes which are most adjacent to the Base Station (BS) need to relay many packets while compare with nodes far away from the sink. The outcome of this approach is these nodes deplete their energy very quickly. It results in a network partitioning and reduces the network lifetime. This paper proposes and evaluates a technique for maximizing the lifetime of WSN by preventing sink isolation due to hotspot problem. The clustering mechanism can be used to reduce the energy depletion of node near to the sink node. The cluster is formed based on distance attribute. This mechanism provides the scalability and avoids the redundancy through data collection operation. This paper will analyze the energy consumption of proposed technique using various distance measures.},

abstract={In this paper the scale mixture of Gaussian distribution is used to model the stock return data in financial market. There are many volatility models and forecasting methods. Some of the models are Historical volatility models, Implied volatility models, Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity models, models based on Artificial Neural Network. All these models are direct models. In these models the influence of economic factors like price level uncertainty, riskless rate of interest, the equity risk premium and the ratio of expected profit to expected revenue for the economy are not taken into account. Here the volatility parameter 'σ' is treated as a function of an economic factor. The main economic factor considered is the ratio of expected profit to expected revenue. Economic ratio is assumed to follow the exponential distribution. The resultant distribution is fitted to Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) data by estimating the parameters. It is observed that this mixture distribution is a better fit than the GARCH fit. © IDOSI Publications, 2014.},

abstract={Purpose: Currently, no tests are available to monitor and predict severity and outcome of dengue. To find potential markers that predict dengue severity, the present study validated the serum level of three acute-phase proteins α-1 antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin and ferritin in a pool of severe dengue cases compared to non-severe forms and other febrile illness controls.
Methods: A total of 96 patients were divided into two equal groups with group ‘A’ comprising dengue-infected cases and group ‘B’ with other febrile illness cases negative for dengue. Out of 48 dengue-infected cases, 13 had severe dengue and the remaining 35 were classified as non-severe dengue. Immunoassays were performed to evaluate the serum levels of acute-phase proteins both on the day of admission and on the day of defervescence. The efficiency of individual proteins in predicting the disease severity was assessed using receiver operating characteristic curve.
Results: The study did not find any significant difference in the levels of α-1 antitrypsin between the clinical groups. A significant increase in the levels of ceruloplasmin around defervescence in severe cases compared to non-severe and other febrile controls was observed and this is the first report describing the potential association of ceruloplasmin and dengue severity. Interestingly, a steady increase in the level of serum ferritin was recorded throughout the course of illness. Among all the three proteins, the elevated ferritin level could predict the disease severity with highest sensitivity and specificity of 76.9 and 83.3 %, respectively, on the day of admission and the same was found to be 90 and 91.6 % around defervescence.
Conclusion: On the basis of this diagnostic efficiency, we propose that ferritin may serve as a potential biomarker for an early prediction of disease severity. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

To train the neural network there are many training algorithms available. The selections of training methods are varied according to the process behaviors. They give their sufficient contribution to network training according to their parameter estimation. But the problem occurred in network training is parameter estimation to predict the process behavior when the process is involving with a new. To avoid such the problem in network training Bayesian regularized (BR) method of training is used in the study to artificial neural networks formation. The network formulated through Bayesian regularized method is mentioned as Bayesian regularized artificial neural networks (BRANNs). The network which is trained by BR is stronger than standard back-propagation nets since. The problem that is raised during the network training is extended cross-validation and over fitting. By using the BR trained network the respective problems are deduced. In the study an ELMAN recurrent neural network (ERNN) is developed and it is trained by Bayesian regularized algorithm. Then, the proposed Bayesian regularized ELMAN recurrent network (BRERNN) performance is compared with the network model trained with some other learning algorithm. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={With an objective to understand the impact on groundwater quality, a Gondwana coal mining area of eastern India, known for its prime coking coal – Jharia Coal Field, has been modeled through GIS. Based on defined chemical parameters, four quality classes have been categorized and assessed against different thematic information’s. Though only 3% area represents mining zone, the impact on groundwater quality in surrounding areas is sizeable. Geology of the area has a direct bearing on different quality classes and nearly 12% area is under threat due to mining activities in sandstone aquifers. Most of the high drainage density areas are under mining activities and thereby, good quality water zones are under threat. Nearly 29% area that falls under high lineament density class is associated with core and buffer activities indicate significant decreasing trend in recharge capacity with increasing damages on land. Nearly 20% of sandy loam soil area is indirectly associated with the adverse impacts due to mining. Evaluation on land capability indicates that the continuous mining activity not only records undesirable impact on groundwater but also leads to the generation of wastelands. Significantly, the study warrants an appropriate sustainable development program for the conservation of the water resources in the study mining area. © 2014, Sphinx Knowledge House.

The secret data is embedded only in high frequency sub-bands of the frequency domain transform of the cover image. Both adaptive and non-adaptive embedding techniques are employed and the results are compared. Also, random traversing for embedding the secret data is implemented for higher security.

abstract={The effect of silibinin on lipid profile, colonic mucin content, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) expression, cell proliferation and apoptosis in high fat diet fed rats challenged with 1, 2 dimethyl hydrazine (DMH) was investigated. Rats were randomized into six groups. Group 1: Control rats; Group 2: Silibinin (50 mg/kg of b.w. p.o every day); Group 3: DMH (20 mg/kg b.w.); Groups 4-6: DMH + Silibinin (Initiation, Post-initiation and entire period treatment regimens, respectively). At the end of 32nd week, DMH alone administered rats showed hyperlipidaemia and colon tumour burden with decreased mucin content. The expression of TGF-β was found to be lost in the early adenoma but increased stromal positivity of TGF-β was observed in adenocarcinoma of the colon. Evasion of apoptosis is also seen in the colon of tumour bearing rats. These DMH induced pathological changes were attenuated by silibinin supplementation reflecting its antihyperlipidaemic, colon protective and anticarcinogenic effects. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={In this paper, the effect of gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) parameters on the pitting corrosion on AISI 202 chromium manganese stainless steel was investigated. An empirical mathematical equation correlating pitting resistance equivalent number (PREN) with the welding parameters such as welding current, welding speed, welding gun angle and gas flow rate was developed. Central composite response surface methodology with four parameter and five levels was employed for conducting the experiments. The adequacy of the developed model was checked using ANOVA. The main effects of the process parameters on PREN of the welded joints were studied using surface and contour plots. The quality of the weld joint is also highly influenced by the microstructure of the weldment. The quality of the weldment gets deteriorated due to metallurgical changes such as micro-segregation, precipitation of secondary phases, presence of porosities, grain growth in the heat affected zone and loss of material by vaporization. This paper also investigates the influence of welding gun angle on the microstructure examination of the weldment. The microstructure study concentrated on the grain structure, presence of carbides and formation of ferrite, austenite and martensite in the weldment. The results obtained from the present investigation helps in quickly selecting the required process parameters to achieve the desired PREN and weld quality. © 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

In accordance with this, we have simulated a mechanism in which the unfolding and folding of the stair is due to the linear motion of the slider at one end. The effect of the change in length of connecting rod that converts linear motion to rotary motion is to be analyzed. Here we consider 10 different lengths of the connecting rod. The force needed to move the slider is measured using MSC ADAMS™ software in each of these cases. Then a linear actuation circuit for the slider using a double acting cylinder is designed and simulated using Festo FluidSIM™ software.

An effective method, the Tsallis entropy model, is used to calculate the threshold value based on which the image is segmented. To get better feature extraction, the non-extensive parameter 'q' is used to distinguish the long-range correlation. The value of this parameter is varied and is found to give good results when q equals '0.8'.

abstract={Shortage of water is a cause of concern throughout the world especially in developing and under-developed countries. India has already become water stressed country. Rainwater harvesting has been in practice around the world since ancient days. Traditional rainwater harvesting structures present exhibit the existence of such practice in India. Rainwater harvesting ponds, called as 'Oorany' in Tamil language, are prevalent and are being used for drinking purpose in part of Dindigul District, Tamilnadu State, India. Samuthirapatty is a rural village in Natham block, Dindigul district has one such pond, which was established three century back. An attempt has been made to study the hydrological and physico-chemical parameters of Samuthirapatty pond. The capacity of the pond is 23.53 million litres. Runoff potential estimation indicates that the rainfall excess works to 321.48 million litres over one square kilometre of area for the 50-year mean monthly rainfall. The present annual drinking water demand of Samuthirapatty is 23.50 million litres. Pond water is very soft with the total dissolved salts of 58 mg/L. Excess iron, turbidity and fecal coliform render the water unsafe for drinking. Pond water enjoys palatability and is the preferred choice for drinking and cooking. Promotion of point-of-use (POU) water treatment system with community education may render the system sustainable. These type of ponds may be rejuvenated and will be very helpful to ensure water security as supplementary sources. © 2006-2014 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).},

abstract={Purpose - In milling process the surface roughness and delamination are the most important performance characteristics, which are influenced by many factors like fibre orientation angle, helix angle, feed rate and spindle speed. The selection of these parameters at optimum level plays a vital role in getting minimum surface roughness and delamination factor. The purpose of this paper is to present multi-objective optimisation of Computer Numerical Control milling parameters using Grey-Taguchi method to get minimum surface roughness and delamination factor in machining of glass fibre reinforced plastics (GFRP) composites used in automotive, aircraft and manufacture of space ships.
Design/methodology/approach - The experiments are designed and conducted based on Taguchi's L27 orthogonal array by taking fibre orientation angle, helix angle, feed rate and spindle speed at three levels and responses are surface roughness and delamination factor. Taguchi's signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio are determined based on their performance characteristics. A Grey relation grade is obtained by using S/N ratio. Based on Grey relational grade value, optimum levels of parameters have been identified by using response table and response graph.
Findings - Optimum levels of parameters for GFRP composites have been identified by using response table and response graph and the significant contributions of controlling parameters are estimated using analysis of variance.
Originality/value - The combined effect of fibre orientation angle and helix angle during milling of GFRP composites using Grey relational analysis has not been previously attempted for analysis. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={In this study, an intelligent and ingenious way of tracing the bearings of decomposed, crumbled and burnt food with the help of rule-based reasoning and Apothegm topiary has been presented. The data being acquired from various sensors in a kitchen environment is captured, interpreted and analysed based on the widely leveraged time-series phenomenon. The interpretation procedure is strictly rule-based that includes finding references of the odour in the kitchen from various roots that includes decayed food in the refrigerator, rotten things from the trash bin, some left outs in the wash basin and over cooked or burnt food in the oven. The inspiration for this research work came from the distinguished context-aware capability of Smart Sensor Networks (SSNs). That is, in any environment today, smart sensors have the inherent capability of connecting with one another wirelessly in their vicinity and with remote ones via., networking. The data originating from different sensors get fused appropriately to bring forth pragmatic and easily utilizable context-sensitive information accordingly to empower humans in time. Here in this case, sensors are collaboratively figuring out the decayed and crumbled food particles that cause many diseases which we are not aware of. The frame of reference is tried and tested in a smart kitchen which is embedded with well suited and well-timed sensors that stakes the scoop of context-aware environment.

abstract={Context-awareness is an essential feature for establishing and sustaining a variety of specific as well as generic smarter environments. However, the acts of gleaning context information from different and distributed sources and interpreting it for real-time and actionable insights are not easy tasks. Having understood this requirement, we have conceptualized a new-generation context-awareness framework in order to simplify and streamlining context-awareness, which is the distinct need for next-generation smarter spaces. In this study, we have laid down all the right and relevant details of the approach and the framework solution through a host of renowned use cases. Further on, we have vividly illustrated the performance evaluations for the authenticity and strategic success of our approach and the solution incorporated. © 2014 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

abstract={The main issues of current web application is easily hacking the user information by unauthorized person. The development of entire web application depends on scripting languages that easily displays the user authentication code to the web browser. All code must be transferred through query string parameter (URL) of the web application. This kind of application security fails when verifying it by penetration testing which is based on XSS languages. This study overcomes the security issues by developing a web application based on cross site scripting technique which the user codes are encrypted using RSA algorithm and cookies, cross domain verification based on encrypted use code. XSS vulnerabilities come in different forms and may be categorized into two varieties: reflected and stored. Reflected is on type of attack which can be performed against applications that employ a dynamic page error message to users. Stored XSS vulnerability appears when data submitted by one user is store in the application or in the back-end database. The user cookies of the web browser store only the encrypted key values. These techniques applied in Enterprise web application it support multiple organization for processing product purchase order, sales order and invoice details. © Maxwell Scientific Organization, 2014.},

This paper shows the interoperability of Evolutionary Computation, concretely Genetic Algorithms (GA), and Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) in IEDSS through the GESCONDA tool. GESCONDA is a tool for the deployment of Intelligent Decision Support Systems. This interoperability has been tested with several domains with different purposes like classification tasks, predictive tasks, etc. In the paper, the application in one environmental domain is described and analysed. The experimentation results indicate that this interoperation of both methods can improve the results of the application of one single method, CBR or GA. Thus, the potential of this kind of interoperation seems to be very good and it is an illustrating example of the benefits of Interoperable Intelligent Environmental Decision Support Systems.},

BS synthesizes the AgNPs, in a free radical exchange process involving reactive oxygen species. The possible mechanism of the influence of BS on the reduction and stabilization of AgNPs is also discussed. The optical properties and morphology of the AgNPs were characterized by absorption spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. These bio-inspired AgNPs exhibited good catalytic activity during the catalytic degradation of environmentally hazardous organic dyes like methylene blue, methyl red, Congo red and acridine orange, in aqueous media.

abstract={The quality of stainless steel weld is highly influenced by delta ferrite content expressed in terms of ferrite number. The quantity of delta ferrite content formed is controlled by the process parameters. This paper discusses the development of artificial neural network model for predicting the ferrite number in 202 grade stainless steel gas tungsten arc welded plates (GTAW). The process parameters chosen for study are welding gun angle, welding speed, plate length, welding current and shielding gas flow rate. The experiments were conducted based on design of experiments - fractional factorial with 125 runs. Using the experimental data, feed forward, back propagation neural models were developed and trained using Levenberg Marquardt algorithm. The training, learning, performance and transfer functions used are trainlm, learningdm, mean square error and tansig respectively. Five networks were developed with five neurons in the input layer, 1 neuron in the output layer and different nodes in the hidden layer. They are 5-3-1, 5-5-1, 5-10-1, 5-11-1 and 5-15-1. It was found that the artificial neural network (ANN) model based on network 5-5-1 predicted ferrite number more accurately than other networks. The prediction helps in identifying the recommended combination of process parameters to achieve a desired ferrite number in GTAW of stainless steel 202 grade plates. © 2014 - IOS Press and the authors.

Results: Significant (P<0.05) concentration-dependent free radical scavenging activity, antioxidant activity, and reducing power was observed by O. gratissimum products. Moreover, eugenol is more potent than the two extract products of O. gratissimum, but lower than potent antioxidant ascorbic acid. Conclusions: Hence, O. gratissimum presents a potentially valuable source of natural antioxidant and bioactive material. © 2014 Hainan Medical College.},

Cryptography renders an image unreadable whereas, steganography aims at hiding secret information in the image. In the scrambled image, adaptive Least Significant Bit (LSB) substitution has been performed using Pixel Value Differencing (PVD) based on Pixel Indicator (PI) method for colour images. Here, secret data is embedded only in R and G planes while, B plane acts as an indicator for embedding.

The objectives were to find out the prevalence of metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus and correlation between variables. Seventy six college students not found to be obviously obese were selected on a single day. All went through the study and no one was excluded. In the clinical laboratory we measured waist and hip circumference, weight and height, Fasting Blood Sugar, Triglycerides, High Density Lipoprotein, Systolic Blood Pressure and Diastolic Blood Pressure. All students were having no calorie intake for eight hours. The body mass index (BMI) was calculated. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 5.2 %. If two instead of three variables were taken into account, the prevalence rate rose to 22.3 %. One out of the seventy six was found to be a frank diabetic. There is a definite correlation between variables of the metabolic syndrome which coincided with the findings of earlier studies. A routine work up for college students regarding metabolic syndrome and programmes to control it in a regular manner is suggested.},

abstract={Vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) is a communication network used for vehicle to vehicle interaction and this network is different from other wireless networks. Geographical Routing Protocol (GRP) is used in VANETs. This study proposes a Fuzzy Quality of Service GRP (FQ_GRP) to enhance the performance of GRP routing. Link quality, traffic density and number of intersections are inputs to a fuzzy system and the fuzzy controller output is next hop selection. Simulations are conducted with 40 nodes around 9 square kilometers. The proposed FQ_GRP routing scheme, distributes the traffic through nodes so that the throughput is increased and average latency reduced. The proposed method achieves better throughput and lower end to end delay compared to traditional GRP. © 2014 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l.-All rights reserved.},

abstract={A study was conducted to estimate the runoff in urbanized zone using Soil Conservation Services Curve Number (SCS-CN) method through remote sensing and GIS techniques. In this study, the region was identified as Cochin Corporation (Kerala State, India) with an aerial extent of 96.44 km2. The spatial and non-spatial data were collected from different sources, and the thematic layers of soil hydrologic group and land-use maps were prepared and overlaid with one other. The overlaid output results were assigned by curve numbers with respect to soil and land-use categories, and the CN map was prepared with the help of Visual Basic (VB) language in ArcGIS platform. Through supervised classifications, 13 different land-use classes were identified from Quickbird data for the year of 2005 and 2010. The most prominent land-use classes were water bodies, residential, mixed crops, commercial and industrial, and 3 types of soil hydrologic groups were identified namely A, B, and C categories. The B group is most prominent occupying 60 km2 of the study area. The CN map shows the ranges that 92-100 is the major CN area with high runoff potential zone of the study region. At the final stage, the runoff was estimated by the maximum successive rainfall received in this study area in two different years-2005 and 2010 along with their land-use pattern. The runoff model is applied for temporal variation in land-use change, and impact of runoff was studied. The study area showed significant changes in land-use pattern between 2005 and 2010 particularly in the land-use change from agricultural into industrial, commercial, and residential (high density). The area covered by the highest runoff depth with the range of 92-100 CN values increased from 43.87 to 45.32 km2 from 2005 to 2010. The volume of runoff was increased from 135.56 to 141.49 Mm3 from 2005 to 2010 due to the land-use change pattern. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={An Experimental investigation is conducted to establish the feasibility of using Jatropha biodiesel in Direct Injection Compression Ignition (DICI) engines. While the biodiesel has certain limitations and adverse in terms of poor performance and high level of pollutants in the exhaust of the gases, specified chemical (Propylene Glycol, C3H8O2) and nano (Al2O3) additives are used with Jatropha biodiesel. The experiments are conducted in two phases by using an experimental test rig, which consists of a DICI engine, electric loading device, data acquisition system, and AVL exhaust gas analyzers. In the first phases of experimentation, the performance and emission characteristics of the engine are analyzed by using neat diesel and Jatropha biodiesel and in the second phase of investigation, similar experiments are conducted by using chemical and nano additives blended biodiesel. The results of biodiesel are compared with those of neat diesel and it is seen that the performance and emission characteristics of the engine are inferior in the case of biodiesel when compared with neat diesel. However, the results revealed that the working characteristics could be improved by selecting of proper chemical and nano additives in right proportions. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Flow mal-distribution is defined as the non-uniform fluid flow distribution among the parallel channels having a common header. Flow mal-distribution is present in every header channel assembly. This mal-distribution has a significant effect on the performance of the heat exchanger by increasing the pressure drop and affecting the heat transfer characteristics. However, in designing a heat exchanger, a uniform flow distribution in each channel is assumed. The present work attempts to reduce the flow mal-distribution in a cross flow heat exchanger. A numerical analysis is done using a commercial code ANSYS FLUENT 3D and the results are validated experimentally. A parametric study is done by changing the size of the channels within the heat exchanger so as to reduce the flow mal-distribution. The effect of varying channel size on flow mal-distribution and pressure drop across the heat exchanger is studied and a geometry with reduced flow mal-distribution is found. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={This paper revolves around the idea of finding the strength enhancement of pure 'Al' compacts processed through Equal-Channel Angular Pressing (ECAP) process which ultimately results in fine grain structure of the material processed. The material initially prepared through conventional powder metallurgical route is processed in an ECAP die with a channel angle of 1100. The tensile test and micro-structural evaluation is done following the ECAP process and it is found that there was a substantial enhancement in the tensile properties and Ultrafine Grain (UFG) structure is obtained due to the Severe Plastic Deformation (SPD) phenomenon taking place during the process. The pore closure behavior is also analyzed using the TEM micrographs after each pass in ECAP die and promising results are obtained when the material is processed through different routes. The dislocation cell structure is also found to get refined after each pass through the die. The pore closure behavior is also confirmed using the DEFORM 3D software when the aluminum is simulated under similar conditions. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

The study was aimed to evaluate in vitro hepatoprotective activity of Aplotaxis auriculata rhizome (200 and 400μg/ml) through CCl4 induced toxicity in hepatocytes. The phytochemical screening revealed the presence of flavonoids, terpenoids, triterpenoids, polyphenol and tannins. All the variables tested as LPO, GSH, Protein, Bilirubin, ALP, SGOT and SGPT recorded a significant alteration observed in CCl4 exposed hepatocytes. However treatment with Aplotaxis auriculata extract restored the level and to near normal values was observed. The potential hepatoprotective activity of Aplotaxis auriculata is due to the presence of phytochemical constitution present in plant. Some of these phytochemicals such as flavonoids and polyphenolic compounds might have possessed hepatoprotective activity.},

abstract={Increasing consumption of tobacco and alcohol has led to a steady increase in the incidence of head and neck cancers in Asia. The drawbacks associated with the existing chemotherapeutic and surgical interventions have necessitated the development of a safer alternative for therapy of head and neck cancers. In this study we have explored the synergistic therapeutic potential of a phytochemical and chemotherapeutic agent using PEGylated liposomes as a delivery vehicle. Resveratrol and 5-fluorouracil were successfully coencapsulated in a single PEGylated nanoliposome. The thermal analysis and the nuclear magnetic resonance results revealed that resveratrol localized near the glycerol backbone of the liposomal membrane while 5-fluorouracil localized closer to the phosphate moiety, which influenced the release kinetics of both drugs. The nanoformulation was tested in vitro on a head and neck cancer cell line NT8e and was found to exhibit a GI50 similar to that of free 5-fluorouracil. Further, gene expression studies showed that the combination of resveratrol and 5-fluorouracil exhibited different effects on different genes that may influence the net antagonistic effect. The coencapsulation of resveratrol and 5-fluorouracil in a liposomal nanocarrier improved the cytotoxicity in comparison with the free drug combination when tested in vitro. © 2014 Aarti Mohan,et al.},

Methods: The biofilm forming ability of Candida rugosa and Cryptococcus laurentii was evaluated using XTT (2,3-bis [2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl]-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide) reduction assay and monitored by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Copious amount of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) produced by yeast species was quantified and characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Results: Yeast biofilm formed on gravels by C. rugosa and C. laurentii showed 88% and 74.2% removal of Zn(II) ions respectively in batch mode. In column mode, removal of Zn(II) ions from real effluent was found to be 95.29% by C. rugosa biofilm formed on gravels. Conclusion: The results of the present study showed that there is a scope to develop a cost effective method for the efficient removal of Zn(II) from effluent using gravels coated with yeast biofilm. © 2014 Basak et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={In adsorption study, to describe sorption process and evaluation of best-fitting isotherm model is a key analysis to investigate the theoretical hypothesis. Hence, numerous statistically analysis have been extensively used to estimate validity of the experimental equilibrium adsorption values with the predicted equilibrium values. Several statistical error analysis were carried out. In the present study, the following statistical analysis were carried out to evaluate the adsorption isotherm model fitness, like the Pearson correlation, the coefficient of determination and the Chi-square test, have been used. The ANOVA test was carried out for evaluating significance of various error functions and also coefficient of dispersion were evaluated for linearised and non-linearised models. The adsorption of phenol onto natural soil (Local name Kalathur soil) was carried out, in batch mode at 30 ± 20 C. For estimating the isotherm parameters, to get a holistic view of the analysis the models were compared between linear and non-linear isotherm models. The result reveled that, among above mentioned error functions and statistical functions were designed to determine the best fitting isotherm. © 2014 Subramanyam and Das; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={The durability of the reinforced concrete structures is greatly affected by chloride ion diffusion. The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the chloride migration coefficient under accelerated test conditions. Accelerated test methods permit migration rates to be evaluated for a specific mix design in a relatively short time. Ordinary Portland cement concretes of three different water-cement ratios 0.55, 0.45, 0.40 are used in this study. Two accelerated non-steady state test methods (i) Rapid chloride migration test (RCMT) (NT BUILD 492) and (ii) Accelerated chloride migration test (ACMT) with 24V are used. Chloride penetration depth is obtained by Colourimetric method (0.1N AgNO3) and comparison is made with two accelerated test methods. It has been observed that in RCMT, the chloride migration coefficient increases with increase in water-cement ratio and is about 2.5 times less for w/c ratio 0.40 when compared to that of w/c ratio 0.55 and in ACMT, the chloride migration coefficient is 1.7 times less. The rate of Chloride penetration between two accelerated test methods showed good correlation.},

abstract={Advanced analysis of steel frames is required to arrive at the connection stiffness of beam and column. In reality, simple connections have moment resistance and fixed connections have certain flexibility, which are designated as semi-rigid connections. In order to evaluate the connection stiffness, Indian code for design of hot -rolled steel structural components, IS: 800-2007, recommends using Frye-Morris polynomial model. Different models are recommended for different connection configurations. These polynomial models were developed based on the test results and studies conducted at rest of the world, which have different material strength and construction practices. Hence, there is scope and requirement to evaluate the polynomial models of these connections. Towards this requirement, the polynomial model for top-seat angle with double web angle connections is evaluated for its performance in the present study. For this purpose, experimental results available in the literature have been collected and used in the comparative study.

abstract={In this era where smartness is the key, automatic systems are preferred over manual ones. An important application of smart technology is efficient energy utilization, which is the need of the hour. Energy consumption can be minimized by using lighting responsibly i. e. to switch off whenever not required and by using smart systems, where based on surroundings and requirements the intensity of lighting can be changed automatically. The use of green technology can also reduce the dependence on conventional sources of energy. One simple way to reduce carbon footprint is the usage of a lighting control system which delivers light as per the requirements and avoid unnecessary wastage. In this paper, a lighting control system using an android application has been proposed. Android is one of the widely used open source mobile platform and the user base is growing faster day by day. As more people are using smart phones, controlling light using an android application is cheaper, easier and cost effective. © Research India Publications.},

Congestion in an EVDO network is the accumulation of data traffic at some point in the network leading to loss or blocking of data. It is a problem relating to the capacity of the network. Traffic planning plays an important role in minimizing congestion by pre- planning or designing a system to meet the network demands. Congestion management is the process of overcoming the problem of congestion by employing certain methods known as decongestion mechanisms. This process is also known as decongestion. In this paper, the traffic pattern of EVDO network is studied; the various causes of congestion are analyzed; congested areas of the network are identified and a suitable decongestion mechanism is applied on the same. After applying decongestion, the cluster performance of the network and its corresponding utilization is calculated. Thence the capacity of the network is increased. © Research India Publications.},

This filter is used to remove the acoustic noise due to its simplicity in computation & robust behavior when implemented in finite-precision hardware. It provides better communication by suppressing the acoustic noise to a larger extent, since it provides a better balance between complexity & convergence speed. In spite of various methods, the results obtained in this way of noise cancellation are optimistic. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Morphometric analysis is an indispensable tool for hydrological investigation that involves the development and management of drainage basin. This study characterizes the micro watersheds in the Palar sub-watershed using morphometric analysis and assesses its risk by land use and land cover features in a particular micro watershed. Palar sub-watershed is divided into 6 micro watersheds for prioritization based on morphometric and land use analysis. Several morphometric parameters (linear, shape and relief) are determined from the drainage map; ranks are assigned based on their capacity to induce erodability and degradation. Final ranking is based on the composite index calculated from the sum of the ranks of each morphometric parameter. Morphometric analysis reveals micro watersheds 5 and 6 as most susceptible and 2 and 3 as low susceptible. Land use is mapped using IRS ID LISS III satellite data. The risk in terms of watershed degradation involved to each micro watershed is based on the ranks of each land use feature, obtained from a similar composite index as that of morphometric analysis. Land use analysis shows that micro watersheds 2 and 4 fall under high priority category while 5 and 6 under low priority category. Integration of the morphometric and land use analysis shows that only micro watershed 1 falls under the same category in both analyses. Control measures are suggested to contain degradation depending on its specific land use pattern and morphometric features. This study can be used to prepare a comprehensive watershed plan for the development or for planning resource conservation strategies, by integrating land use features with the drainage characteristics of the region, in particular for a hill ecosystem as the prioritization is at micro level. © 2014 Science Press, Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Objective: The study was aimed to evaluate of in vitro antioxidant activity of Shorea robusta leaves (200 and 400μg/ml) through CCl4 induced oxidative stress in hepatocytes. Methods: The cytotoxicity of Shorea robusta on hepatocytes was evaluated by MTT assay [(3-(4,5 dimethylthiazole -2 yl)-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay]. The percentage viability of the hepatocytes was carried out.The isolated hepatocytes were cultured in Ham's F12 medium, supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum, antibiotics, dexamethasone and bovine insulin. The cell suspension was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in a humidified incubator under 5% CO2. After incubation of 24 hrs, the hepatocytes were exposed to the fresh medium containing CCl4 (1%) along with different concentration of Shorea robusta (200 and 400μg/ml). After 60 min of CCl4 intoxication, the oxidative stress markers were determined. Results: The phytochemical screening revealed the presence of flavonoids, terpenoids, triterpenoids, polyphenol and tannins in Methanol extracts. The percentage viability of the hepatocytes was dose dependent. The entire variables tested i.e., SOD. CAT, GPx, reduced glutathione, vitamin C and vitamin E recorded a significant decline on CCl4 treatment. However, treatment with Shorea robusta extract restored the levels to near normal value, suggesting the therapeutic effect of Shorea robusta to counter the oxidative stress. Among the two doses, the higer dose has potential antioxidant activity. Conclusion: The results of the present study concluded that methanol extract of Shorea robusta exhibit a liver protective effect against CCl4 induced oxidative stress and possessed anti-lipid peroxidative and antioxidant activities. The potential antioxidant activity of Shorea robusta leaves may be due to the presence of radical scavenging property of phenolic groups. Our results may aid in the development of new methods for enhancing the health of the hepatocytes.},

abstract={Nanostructured ZnO thin films were deposited on glass substrates using a DC reactive magnetron sputtering technique. Thin films of three different thicknesses viz 40, 100 and 300 nm were prepared and subsequently annealed at 450 °C. The structural, topographical, and optical characteristics of all the three annealed films were studied using X-ray diffractometer (XRD), Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) UV-visible and photoluminescence spectrophotometers. The carbon dioxide (CO2) gas sensing behavior of these films was investigated in detail in the concentration range of 500-10,000 ppm. The sensing performance was optimized with respect to the ZnO film thickness as well as the operating temperature. ZnO film with 40 nm thickness showed better response characteristics at the operating temperature of 300 °C than that of thicker ZnO films. A maximum sensitivity (%) of 1.13 with a response and recovery time of 20 s was observed towards 1000 ppm of CO2. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.},

abstract={Geographic data consist of location and extent or degree, which are not hold up by a standardized modeling language like Unified Modeling Language (UML). Here, development of broad standard data models presents an interesting challenge since the level of complexity becomes high, and the resultant database schema becomes unusable. In this paper, an attempt is made to address the need of well documented and organized data based on certain standard formats. As UML became extensively used Case Tool both for academic and industry needs, now it became a standard modeling language defined by Open Management Group (OMG) and International Organization for Standardization (ISO). UML covers simple concepts and is very perceptive and easy to use. But association between object, definition of constraints, generalization among data concepts and its quality factors are important to be considered while modeling geographic data. So, to address this issue, this paper proposes UML based data model as a solution, extended to accommodate the spatial data which are derived from the remote sensing images. The solution implemented through the use of stereotyped classes to represent spatial data in a straightforward manner including support for geometries as well as the definitions of attributes, objects, classes and association relations among them. In this paper, UML profile based models are created for various features like Road, Forest, Waterbody, Builtup, Cultivation, Mining and Wasteland and the Extensible Markup Language (XML) code is generated which are stored in XML Metadata Interchange (XMI). Then using ArcGIS support, this code is converted into schemas and finally the schema is populated with data that is used in the study of deforestation factors using GIS and Remote Sensing. The final outcome of the model to database is physically implemented and few tables are also presented here. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Activated carbon was prepared from Tuncbilek-Kutahya (Turkey) lignite (LAC) which was chosen as a precursor due to its availability and low-cost. The precursor was impregnated with distilled water and KOH and was selected in 1:4 ratios. A Magnetic Activated Carbon (MAC) was prepared by 0.5 g of the modified LAC in 20 mL aqueous solution containing 4 g Fe(N03),.9H20. The ability of the activated carbons to adsorb gold ions from aqueous solution by adsorption was investigated. The BET surface area values of the activated carbons ranged from 667-928 m2 g-1. The effect of particle size on the activated carbon had very small effect on the specific surface area because of internal pore structure development. The effects of various experimental parameters such as initial gold concentration, pH and adsorbent dosage were investigated in a batch adsorption technique. The percentage of gold adsorption onto Commercial Activated Carbon (CAC), LAC and MAC showed the same trend, they adsorbed more than 80% of gold in the first 15 min and nearly 100% in next 45 min. On the other hand, the coarser carbon, CAC-1, adsorbed nearly 30% of gold in first 15 min and 65% in next 45 min due to the particle size effect. © 2014 Knowledpa Review, Malaysia.},

abstract={Soil anchors are the most suitable foundation elements that are used to support structures subjected to uplift which may occur due to wind loading in transmission towers or wave action on offshore structures or buoyancy force on buried pipelines. This study presents a small scale experimental investigation on the pullout behaviour of 100 mm diameter circular plate anchor in dry sand of loose, medium dense and dense relative densities. The study characterizes the load-displacement behaviour, expressing the pullout capacity in terms of the dimensionless break-out factor. Embedment ratio and relative density of sand has a significant influence on the pullout capacity. Pullout capacity increased with the increase in embedment ratio, for all relative densities investigated. Critical embedment ratio for loose and medium dense sand is 10 and for dense sand, it is 12. The critical embedment ratio signifies the transition in behaviour of anchors from shallow to deep. The displacement corresponding to the ultimate load is used to find the critical embedment ratio. The displacement corresponhng to ultimate pullout load is higher for loose sand irrespective of increase in embedment ratio. © 2014 Knowledpa Review, Malaysia.},

abstract={Nitrogen (N) is an essential plant nutrient which is taken up by the crops throughout the growing season. Field experiments were conducted on microirrigation fertigation in garlic crop during the crop growing season of 2008-09 and 2009-10 year (both drip and micro sprinklers). Four levels of nitrogen treatments namely 0, 40, 80 and 120 kg N ha-1 with three replications were applied in both the methods of irrigation in Randomized Block Design (RBD). Water requirement of garlic crop was estimated by using Penman-Monteith method. Periodic soil samples were collected along the lateral (at emitter, 12.5 and 25 cm from emitter) as well as across the lateral (15 and 30 cm from the emitter) at three soil depths (0-15, 15-30 and 30-45 cm) in both methods of irrigation. The plant samples were also collected during the harvest in both the season. It was observed that the soil water content was relatively higher in upper profile and near the emitter in all the three observations at 24, 48 and 72 h after fertigation in both drip and microsprinkler irrigation. The results revealed that N concentration in active root zone (15-30 cm) in microirrigation was more than the initial N content. In the same layer adequate nitrogen availability was observed. Available nitrogen decreased from emitter to the boundary wetting zone in drip fertigation in contrary to microsprinkler fertigation. Nitrogen leaching was higher in drip fertigation than the microsprinkler due to more vertical movement of soil water leading to the movement of the nitrogen beyond the root zone. Nitrogen balance for the study indicated that leaching of nitrogen beyond the root zone increased with the level of nitrogen applied in both the methods of irrigation © 2014 Knowledpa Review, Malaysia.},

abstract={In South India, tanks system is quiet ancient, meant for storing and supplying water towards multifunctional needs of the people. In Tamil Nadu, there are around 39,000 tanks with varying size and types. Over past few decades, irrigation rely on stable and reliable groundwater resources like dug and deep bore wells, consequently tanks lost their significance. Moreover, excessive siltation, improper maintenance and illegal encroachment further degraded the system. The deterioration factors are broadly categorised into problems in catchment, feeder channels and head works, eventually resulting in loss of storage capacity. The present study chiefly narrates an indirect method of estimating loss in storage capacity of tanks and the catchment problem, especially soil erosion and its induced downward siltation using geoinformatics technology. Using remotely sensed satellite data by measuring surface area of tank loss in storage capacity was estimated through a model relationship. Using Digital Elevation Model derived topographic wetness indices data, the catchment problem especially, soil erosion areas are identified and remedial measures are suggested. Under prevailing water crisis, it is essential to rehabilitate the tanks through which the surface water potential can be improved subsequently the groundwater quality and quantity will be enhanced. © 2014 Knowledpa Review, Malaysia.},

abstract={Air entrainment at the hydraulic structure is considered as one of the economical means of air-water transmission of atmospheric gases such as nitrogen and oxygen. The content of Dissolved Oxygen (DO) in the water helps to assess the quality of water. Enhancing the DO level in water course helps in the survival of terrestrial animals, fish and other aquatic organisms. More over, oxygen is needed for all algae, macrophytes and also for numerous chemical reactions that are vital for stream and lake functioning. Air-water transfer process can be administrated in the natural flowing channel by provihng appropriate stepped cascade according to the site condition and availability of driving head for flow. The change in form of energy at the cascade and subsequent formation of turbulence in the flow at the immediate vicinity of downstream side of structure creates entrainment of air to water. This study describes the experimental investigation on the water aeration process at stepped cascade aerator with constant slope for different water quality flow. Large size stepped cascade aerator model is constructed in the laboratory to test its performance for three distinct qualities of water. The data is obtained for different step sizes by keeping slope as constant. © 2014 Knowledpa Review, Malaysia.},

abstract={Psychological / philosophical terms such as soul, self, Atman, ego, mind, consciousness is randomly used without clear cut meanings and definitions in philosophy and psychology. In this paper, we scientifically interpreted and arrived at possible meanings and definitions for consciousness in terms of quantum dots which could be applied in interpreting the biological DNA base pair sequences and for DNA individual molecules. A theoretical detection of cognitive behaviour of mind is attempted with individual molecules of DNA and with that of DNA base pairs. A rule governing the DNA base pairs with that of DNA single molecule is stated in the form of DNA theorems as "If the left hemisphere of the brain is equal to DNA sequence information hemisphere and the right hemisphere is equal to the individual DNA sequence hemisphere, then it may be proved that the distinct part of Ramanujan numbers represent base pair DNA hemisphere and odd part of Ramanujan numbers represent the other non-base pair DNA individual molecules hemisphere are equal". This theorem has multiple applications in tackling the social and health issues. It is possible to detect cognitive behaviour of mind with quantum dots that bind to sequences of DNA which are associated with the individual DNA which shows the cognitive behaviour. If quantum dots are stimulated with light, they emit their unique bar codes making the critical consciousness associated DNA sequences visible and explain the personality development. And also, using number theory, consciousness may be defined as a line of essential singularity lying in a circle of the brain having radius unity with an origin at zero point. This paper will not only has applications in tackling health and social issues, but will also start a new chapter in bringing psychology nearer to the doorsteps of neurological sciences.},

abstract={This paper presents a novel approach to automatic detection of the erythemato-squamous diseases based on fuzzy extreme learning machine (FELM). Enormous computational efforts are required to classify these erythemato-squamous diseases. Some of the approaches performed previously are through fuzzy logic, artificial neural networks and neuro-fuzzy models. FELM-based differential diagnosis of these diseases involves decisions made by fuzzy logic and extreme learning machine (ELM) with greater efficiency in both time and accuracy. In this paper, we develop a user-friendly interface and this tool will be useful for a dermatologist to estimate the six types of erythemato-squamous diseases with the help of patient's histopathological and clinical data. Then, the developed interface is derived inbuilt using neural networks, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system and FELM. A dataset containing records of 366 patients with 34 features that define six disease characteristics was taken, of which 310 records were used as training data and 56 other records used as testing data. The dataset was preprocessed to obtain fuzzy values as input to get more accurate results in FELM. Given a training set of such records, ELM approach is applied. By combining fuzzy logic and ELM, more accurate results with increased performance are obtained with less computational efforts. Finally, the proposed FELM model proves to be a potential solution for the diagnosis of erythemato-squamous diseases with significant improvement in computational time and accuracy compared with other models discussed in the recent literature. © 2013 Springer-Verlag London.},

abstract={The verdicts of most online programming judges are, essentially, binary: the submitted codes are either "good enough" or not. Whilst this policy is appropriate for competitive or recruitment platforms, it can hinder the adoption of online judges on educative settings, where it could be adequate to provide better feedback to a student (or instructor) that has submitted a wrong code. An obvious option would be to just show him or her an instance where the code fails. However, that particular instance could be not very significant, and so could induce unreflectively patching the code. The approach considered in this paper is to data mine all the past incorrect submissions by all the users of the judge, so to extract a small subset of private test cases that may be relevant to most future users. Our solution is based on parsing the test files, building a bipartite graph, and solving a Set Cover problem by means of Integer Linear Programming. We have tested our solution with a hundred problems in Jutge.org. Those experiments suggest that our approach is general, efficient, and provides high quality results.},

abstract={Thermal spray coating techniques are being extensively used for coating various materials for different applications. To combat the wear and to enhance the life, the coating should have the desirable properties like hardness, toughness, lower defects, homogeneous microstructure, and good adhesion to the substrate. The wide spectrum of properties can be achieved with composite coatings which consist of a hard reinforcing phase embedded in a tougher matrix material. In this work, Ni-Cr/Al2O3 composite coating with an approximate thickness of 150 μm was produced by atmospheric plasma thermal spraying on SS 304 substrate. The main objective of this work was to characterize the Ni-Cr/Al2O3 coating. The microstructure and composition of powder and coatings were studied by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Optical Microscope and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The coating characteristics such as porosity, micro-hardness and surface roughness were evaluated.},

abstract={At present, polymers are used in many static and dynamic industrial applications such as bushes, gears, bearings, rollers, timing screws and washers having replaced traditional materials like steel brass, bronze, copper and aluminum which undergo wear and tear. The present investigation was made to study the adhesive wear characteristics of semi-crystalline polyurethane polymer and crystalline polyacetal (Polyoxymethylene- POM) polymer. Polymers considered for this study are potential materials for rollers in hybrid chains in food processing industry and medical equipments. The wear tests were performed under dry conditions using a pinon- disc (ASTM G99) arrangement against a mild steel disc (HRB 67) at room temperature under various loads (60, 80,100N) and sliding speeds (1.8, 2.3, 2.8 m/s). Cylindrical shaped polymers of 25 mm diameter were used for the wear tests. Polyacetal was observed to have the lesser wear rate and coefficient of friction irrespective of load and speed because of its crystalline nature. Polyurethane exhibits higher frictional coefficient at higher sliding velocity.},

abstract={Parthenium hysterophorus is the most invasive weed in India. It competes with crop plants for their nutrients and water. It affects the growth and yield of many crops. Among those green gram is more susceptible. This weed can be controlled by the use of various chemical herbicides, but they can cause environmental pollution and dangerous diseases. Allelopathic potential of many plants have been evolved to control this weed. Herbicidal activity of Datura metal and Nerium oleander were investigated in this work. In this experimental protocol various parameters like carbohydrate, protein, amino acids, total phenol, chlorophyll, carotenoid and enzyme levels of crop plants were analyzed and compared with control. Based on the results, the plant extracts D. metal showed the significant changes in protein, chlorophyll, carotenoid and enzymes compared with control. So the present studies concluded that 15 % concentration of D. metal showed better results in controlling the weeds without affecting the crop. © 2014 The National Academy of Sciences, India.},

The interline DVR is used in this paper with a common dc link (CDC) which is shared by different DVR are connected to different feeders of the distribution system. Here two DVRs are used, out of which one is used for compensation of voltage sag and other for replenishing the CDC link which maintains the specific level of voltage needed. Fuzzy logic controlling technique is incorporated in this method. Proposed work uses the knowledge based operation of fuzzy logic controller with the DVRs to obtain the required voltage magnitude during voltage sag. This work is done by taking the feeder data of Tuticorin thermal Power plant NORMAL EMERGENCY BUS supplying internal auxiliaries. Simulation results are presented using the MATLAB simulink with the IDVR considering the voltage sag problem.

abstract={IPV4 addresses are nearing exhaustion. Transition must be done from IPV4 to IPV6. But transition cannot happen all of a sudden. IPV4 addresses have to be utilized effectively. This shows the dire need of technologies which help in doing so. Carrier Grade NAT which is a sophisticated form of Network Address Translation (NAT) used by ISPs on enterprise domain is one way of doing so Its purpose is not only prolong the addresses for IPV4 but also acts as a transition from IPV4 to IPV6. The transition of IPV4 to IPV6 is an issue because people use devices that tend to follow IPV4. For example: A Feature Mobile Phone is currently IPV4 compatible only. So there exists a Tradeoff in ISP side as they need to take every customer into account before shifting to IPV6 completely. The concept of Network Address Translation in the form of CGNAT provides a solution by paving a way of reusing Addresses. The paper also provides the Test Results that were undertaken before complete implementation of CGNAT. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Antidiabetic compositions derived from botanical sources are well known in traditional medicines in India and other parts of the world. Extensive studies have been carried out on screening the compounds isolated from the fenugreek seeds and other parts of the vegetation for their varied activities. One amongst them is an amino acid i.e., 4-hydroxyisoleucine. This molecule has a potential of not only addressing hyperglycemia amongst diabetic patients but also act in a manner to cure hyperlipidemia, diabetic neuropathy and diabetic nephropathy. Many attempts have been made to isolate this amino acid in pure form but none of the methods were seem to be commercially viable since the content of this amino acid is only 0.3 to 0.4 % in the fenugreek seeds. In this study, an attempt was made to develop a method of isolation of pure form of 4-hydroxyisoleucine followed by scale up to yield a level of kilogram quantity.

It is the underlying chemical interactions that lead to the observed functions, phenotypic characteristics and diversity. However, it is not clear how such complex interactions at the molecular level impart specific functional characteristics of the cell/organism. This review presents a detailed account on how basic biochemical kinetics principles and computational tools are utilized to mathematically model and analyze such complex regulations. Such approaches are of crucial value in terms of (i) understanding disease mechanisms at molecular level, (ii) to predict possible drug targets (iii) to design new experiments and (iv) to combine the new experimental data along with known information to simulate drug specific pharmaco-kinetic behaviour of the system of investigation which might assist in treatment optimization. This review will also discuss a few case based examples reported in this emerging area to elucidate how such tools are successfully utilized to gain insights about biological systems for medical or drug discovery applications.},

abstract={Objective: The present study aims to develop simple, precise and accurate methods for the estimation of levofloxacin hemihydrate and cefpodoxime proxetil by simple UV method (Absorbance ratio method) in pure and tablet dosage form. Methods: A simultaneous determination of levofloxacin hemihydrate and cefpodoxime proxetil by absorbance ratio spectrophotometric method has been developed in combined tablet dosage form. The method is based on the measurements of absorbance at isoabsorptive point. The absorbance measurements were made six times for the formulations at 266 nm, 295.4 nm. The amounts of levofloxacin hemihydrate and cefpodoxime proxetil were found by constructing Q-analysis equation method, from the Q-analysis equation to found the amount of sample. Results: The absorbance of the solutions was measured and the percentage recovery was calculated. The percentage recovery was found to be in the range of 99.87 ±0.2869 for Levofloxacin hemihydrate and 100.26 ± 0.1418 for Cefpodoxime Proxetil. The average %RSD values of Levofloxacin hemihydrate and Cefpodoxime Proxetil was found to be 0.2872 and 0.1414, respectively. The low % RSD value of drugs indicates that this method was accurate. Conclusion: The wavelengths 266nm and 295.4nm were selected for the estimation of Levofloxacin hemihydrate and Cefpodoxime proxetil respectively. In this case 266 is the isobestic point for Levofloxacin hemihydrate and Cefpodoxime proxetil. The percentage label claim present in tablets was found to be 100.26 ± 0.9483 and 100.28 ± 1.9449 for Levofloxacin hemihydrate and Cefpodoxime proxetil, respectively.

abstract={Efficient tag recommendation systems are required to help users in the task of searching, indexing and browsing appropriate blog content. Tag generation has become more popular to annotate web content, other blogs, photos, videos and music. Tag recommendation is an action of signifying valuable and informative tags to a budding item based on the content. We propose a novel approach based on topic ontology for tag recommendation. The proposed approach intelligently generates tag suggestions to blogs. In this paper, we effectively construct the technology entitled Ontology based on Wikipedia categories and WordNet semantic relationship to make the ontology more meaningful and reliable. Spreading activation algorithm is applied to assign interest scores to existing blog content and tags. High quality tags are suggested based on the significance of the interest score. Evaluation proves that the applicability of topic ontology with spreading activation algorithm helps tag recommendation more effective when compared to collaborative tag recommendations. Our proposed approach offers several solutions to tag spamming, sentiment analysis and popularity. Finally, we report the results of an experiment which improves the performance of tag recommendation approach. © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

Signals with lower priority values have to wait in the queue for a longer time to get an access to the channel. Also as the number of high priority frames in the access categories (ACs) increases, results internal collisions. This degrades the performance of 802.11 WLAN. In this research paper we developed an approach to improve the quality of service (QoS) of WLAN by maximizing the channel throughput and minimizing the internal collision, by adaptively changing the contention window (CW) size based on their priority values and the service requirements of the signals in the queue. The proposed algorithm enables the ACs to share the channel and maximize the channel performance and minimize the collision. © 2014 Global IT Research Institute (GIRI).},

abstract={We investigate the role of pump power in the generation of supercontinua spectra induced by modulational instability (MI) in saturable nonlinear media (SNL). First, we analyze the dynamics of MI in the SNL using linear stability analysis. We then deal with the generation of a broadband spectrum by virtue of the instability process, and identify the unique behavior of MI in the SNL system. Unlike the case of Kerr-type nonlinearity, the so-called critical modulational frequency (CMF) does not monotonically increase, but behaves in a unique way, such that the increase in power increases the CMF up to the saturation power, and a further increase in power decreases the CMF. This behavior is identified to be unusual in the context of MI and thus makes the study of MI and supercontinuum generation (SCG) of interest. In order to confirm the above stated behavior in relation to SCG, we numerically analyzed the SCG using a split-step Fourier method, and the results confirm that at input power equal to saturation power, phase matching occurs at a short distance relative to other power levels and leads to a maximum enhancement of SCG in certain SNL materials. © 2014 Astro Ltd.},

Both the uplink and downlinkMU-MIMOsystems, which is employed with improper constellations such as binary phase shift-keying and M-ary amplitude shift-keying are considered. Aminimum TMSE design is formulated as a nonconvex optimization problem under a total transmit power constraint and the closed-form optimum linear precoder and decoder for both the downlink and uplink MU-MIMO systems with improper modulation are determined by solving this nonconvex optimization problem. A novel contribution in this paper is to derive a closed-form optimum linear precoder and decoder for both the downlink and uplink MU-MIMO systems with improper modulation by solving the nonconvex optimization problem under total power constraint. The simulation results show that the performance of the proposed design is improved over the previous design. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.},

abstract={Image compression plays a major role in saving bandwidth and memory space which is the need of hour. In industry various components are tested effectively using NDT (Non-Destructive Testing) and this information is stored in the system. To reduce the memory space required for storing, lossless compression is used. This paper focuses on the various scanning paths methods for lossless compression like spiral, cross, raster, snake, peano and zigzag. These methods are compared on the basis of activity measure, average run length and sum of differences and the result of each method is sent to the Run Length Encoding (RLE) and Huffman for compression. Four different methods are used for compression of the images. In the first method, the binary value of the image is taken directly for compression. In the second method, the binary values are converted into corresponding gray values, before compression. In the third method, the binary bit plane is taken for compression. In the fourth method, the gray code bit plane is taken for compression. The above obtained results are compared with the results from calculation of efficiency parameters. Out of the different scanning methods, spiral and peano performed better than the other methods. Thus, the optimal scanning path for welding radiographic images was identified thereby reducing the bandwidth and can be used for lossless compression which achieves more compression ratio.},

abstract={Objective: This study was undertaken to evaluate the anti-obesity potential of the aqueous tuber extract of Cyperus rotundus L. (ATECR) in high fat cafeteria diet (HFCD) fed obese rats. Methods: Wistar strain of albino rats were divided into six groups comprising of six rats each. Group I served as normal control fed with normal pellet chow, group II served as disease control fed with high fat cafeteria diet, group III, IV and V animals, received ATECR at a dose level of 100, 200 and 300mg/kg bw along with HFCD for 40 days, while, group VI served as standard drug control, which received Orlistat at a dosage of 50mg/kg bw along with HFCD. Results: Administration of HFCD for 40 successive days to experimental rats significantly increased the body weight, organ and fat pad weights, serum total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose levels; and decreased HDL cholesterol as compared to normal control. While treatment with ATECR showed a significant reduction in the body weight gain, organ weight of the liver, kidney, spleen, weight of fat pads and the levels of serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, glucose and increase in HDL cholesterol in a dose dependent manner. Further, the levels of liver markers such as aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), which were found to be elevated in the serum of obese rats, also resumed to normal on treatment with different concentrations of ATECR. Moreover, the consumption of ATECR reduced oxidative stress by enhancing the levels of glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), super oxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase in the hepatic tissue of rats with HFCD induced obesity. Conclusion: These results demonstrate clearly that repeated oral administration of tubers of Cyperus rotundus L. aqueous extract can evoke a potent anti-obesity activity.},

abstract={Background & objectives: The enzyme glutathione-s-transferases (GSTs) are associated with detoxification of DDT, as experimentally proved in Anopheles gambiae. Insect GSTs are classified into six classes and among them Delta and Epsilon class GSTs have been implicated in detoxification of organochlorine insecticides. Both Delta and Epsilon GSTs produce, in total, 24 transcripts that result in the production of corresponding enzyme proteins. However, the conventional assay estimates the level of total GSTs and relates to development of resistance to DDT. Hence, it would be more reliable to estimate the level of the specific class GSTs that shows higher affinity with DDT. This would also lead to design a specific molecular tool for resistance diagnosis. Methods: Of the 24 GSTs, computational models for 23 GSTs, which are available in Swiss-Prot database, were retrieved and for the remaining one, D7-2, for which no model is available in the data bank, a structural model was developed using the sequence of An. dirus B with a PDB ID of 1R5A as the template. All the models were docked with DDT in the presence of reduced glutathione. Results: The energy output showed that Delta, D6 has the highest interaction affinity with DDT. Hence, this particular GST (D6) is likely to get elevated on exposure of mosquitoes to DDT. Interpretation & conclusion: It would be, therefore, possible to design a specific molecular assay to determine the expression level of such high affinity transcript(s) and to use for resistance diagnosis reliably in the vector surveillance programme.},

abstract={The interest in traditional systems of medicine has rejuvenated in the recent times due to the increasing problems with drug resistant microorganisms, side effects of modern synthetic drugs and increasing number of emerging diseases with no proper medication is available in modern medicine. Curative, preventive and nutritive properties of the medicinal plants provide the necessary power and energy to fight the disease and assist the action of the restorative agents in the herbal drug. Liver is highly susceptible to the toxicity of the materials ingested. The role of the liver in maintaining and regulating the internal environment of the body makes it predisposed to such changes. Plants have been used in the treatment of liver diseases since the Vedic period. Hence the present study was designed to assess the hepatoprotective efficacy of a plant drug source Anisochilus carnosus Wall. which would provide an insight to the codified language of traditional medicine, paving way for a healthier world. Aqueous extract of Anisochilus carnosus was prepared using the protocol mentioned in Ayurvedic Formulary of India. The Wistar strains of albino rats used as the experimental models. Animals were divided into six groups each comprising of six rats each. Hepatotoxicity was induced using CCl 4 . The selected plant drug was administered to the animals orally for a period of 21 days. Serum marker enzymes SGOT, SGPT, SALP &amp; SGGT, Biochemical parameters-S.bilirubin, S.protein, hepatic glycogen, hepatic hydroxy proline and S.urea levels were assessed. The induction of liver injury with CCl 4 resulted in significant raise in the serum marker enzyme level, serum bilirubin, hepatic hydroxyl proline content and a decrease in serum protein, urea and tissue glycogen levelsThe biochemical picture and the marker enzyme levels were brought near normal on treatment with the aqueous extract of Anisochilus carnosus. The results obtained clearly portray the efficacy of Anisochilus carnosus against CCl 4 induced hepatotoxicity. The defensive activity may be attributed to the membrane stabilizing activity of the plant.},

abstract={Diabetes mellitus is a group of metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia and alteration in the carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism associated with absolute or relative deficiencies in insulin secretion or insulin action. In the present study antihyperlipidemic activity of Parmelia perlata. Ach. has been evaluated in alloxan induced diabetic albino rats. The aqueous extract of the selected plant was administered at dose levels of 200mg and 400mg/kg body weight for 60 days. After the experimental period the blood and tissue samples were collected and subjected to various biochemical and enzymic parameters. There were profound alteration in fasting blood glucose, serum insulin, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) and liver glycogen levels in alloxanized rats. Glucose-6-phosphatase, glucokinase, and fructose 1-6 bisphosphatase activity were also altered in diabetic rats. Administration of plant extract significantly (P<0.05) reduced the fasting blood glucose and HbA1C level and increased the level of plasma insulin. The activities of glucose metabolizing enzymes were also resumed to normal. There was a profound improvement in serum lipid profiles by reducing serum triglyceride, cholesterol, LDL, VLDL, free fatty acids, phospholipids and increasing the HDL level in a dose dependent manner. The effects of leaf extract were compared with standard drug glibenclamide (600μg/Kg bw). The results indicate that Parmelia perlata. Ach., Linn. could be a good natural source for developing an antidiabetic drug that can effectively maintained the blood glucose levels and lipid profile to near normal values.},

abstract={In Traditional Indian systems of Medicine, numbers of plants are prescribed for the treatment of diabetes and to improve anti oxidant status. In persistent hyperglycemia oxidative stress has been found mainly due to an increased production of free radicals and sharp reduction of antioxidants defenses and the tissue antioxidant status leading to the development of diabetic complications. Hence treatment of diabetic patients with an antioxidant and anti diabetic plant drug will be beneficial in attenuating these complications. With these objectives in the present work a comparative evaluation was made of both anti diabetic and antioxidant potentials of salacia oblonga (SO), Salacia reticulate (SR) and Salacia chinensis (SC) and discussed. The anti oxidant efficacy was evaluated through different systems of assay such as Lipid peroxidation assay, Nitric oxide radical scavenging assay and Reduce Glutathione assay. The Hydroalcoholic extracts of the stem of selected plants were found to possess different levels of antioxidant status. Anti diabetic efficacy was evaluated in the STS induced diabetic rats. However, considering all the assays it can be stated that SO exhibits better antioxidant activity and anti diabetic activity as compared to other two species screened.},

Firstly four factors peptone, KH2PO4, MgSO4 and CuSO4 out of eleven variables greatly influencing the pectinase production were identified by Plackett-Burman design followed by response surface modeling to formulate an EPEM for enhanced pectinase production. Results: Exo-pectinase of 575.58 IU/ml and endo-pectinase of 52.8 IU/ml were obtained from the models at optimum concentration of medium components. The results from the models were validated optimal concentrations of variables resulting in enzyme activities of exo-pectinase (573 IU/ml) and endo-pectinase (52 IU/ml) thus corroborating the predicted models. Conclusion: The cost of raw materials is a vital factor that determines the overall economy of any fermentation process. Use of food industrial wastes as substrates has become an attractive alternative renewable source for enzyme production, consequently reducing the raw materials cost involved in the fermentation process.},

abstract={The conventional indirect ISE Sensors made with Valiynomycin are having loss and drift in the membrane potential and need calibration once in every two to three hours. The major issues faced in these electrodes were problems of stability, drift, life and interference due to higher protein content in samples resulting in pseudo-hypometry (false low measurements). This paper presents development and analysis of Poly Vinyl Chloride (PVC) matrix based coated wire Ion Selective Electrode (ISE) sensor for potassium which overcomes the above problem. The Coated Wire Ion Selective Electrode (CWISE) is used as sensor for the measurement of potassium concentration in human Blood samples. A PVC membrane solution is prepared by dissolving 5% Carboxylated PVC, Poly (Vinyl Chloride-co-vinyl Acetate-co-Vinyl Alcohol), O-Nitro phenyl Octyl Ether (2-NPOE) and the sensing element Bis[(benzo-15-crown-5)-4-methl] pimelate using the solvents Tetrahydrafuran and Cyclohexanone. The membrane solution is coated directly on silver wire incorporated in a PVC substrate fabricated as a flow through cell avoiding the intermediate filling solution and the developed sensor is evaluated for selectivity, response time, detection limit, stability and life. It is observed that the sensor is found to be excellent in selectivity and also of longer life. The selectivity coefficient against other Cations like Sodium was found to be 1.5 × 10-3. The drift in Membrane potential was found to be less than 1mv/hour which proved a higher stability and suitability of its application for Instruments using direct ISE principle. The developed sensor was proved to have reduced effects of pseudohypometry.},

abstract={A nitrogen-rich carbon nanotubes/amorphous carbon (CNT/C) composite was prepared by carbonising a CNT/polyaniline (PANI) composite, and characterised. Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed that the composite retained a mesoporous CNT structure as its backbone, whilst the nitrogen-rich PANI-derived carbon formed a thin amorphous coating on the CNT surface. Electrochemical characterisation of the CNT/C composite indicated that it had nearly double the reversible Li+ intercalation capacity (390 vs. 219 mAh g-1) and 39 % less irreversible capacity (622 vs. 1,015 mAh g-1) than the pristine CNT. The CNT/C composite showed exceptionally high rate capability with a de-intercalation capacity of 81 mAh g-1 at a very high charge/discharge rate of 60 C (time taken for charge or discharge is 1 min) (1 C = 1 h charge or discharge), whereas the pristine CNT delivered 53 mAh g-1 at this C-rate. By comparison, the rate capabilities of conventional graphite (N3 and SLP30) were very poor above 5 C (~17 mAh g-1 at 5 C). Both the pristine CNT and CNT/C composite showed an excellent cyclability at 1 C charge/discharge over 600 cycles. The CNT/C composite maintained a fairly stable capacity of ~200 mAh g-1 after 600 cycles, whilst the commercial graphite showed a steady and significant decrease in de-intercalation capacity; reaching &lt;70 mAh g-1 after 600 cycles. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={The secretory protein Slit2 and its receptors Robo1 and Robo4 are considered to regulate mobility and permeability of endothelial cells and other cell types. However, the roles of Slit2 and its two receptors in endothelial inflammatory responses remain to be clarified. In this study, we show that, in primary HUVECs, Slit2 represses LPS-induced secretion of certain inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, cell adhesion molecule ICAM-1 upregulation, and monocyte adhesion. Slit2's anti-inflammatory effect is mediated by its dominant endothelial-specific receptor Robo4. However, the minor receptor Robo1 has proinflammatory properties and is downregulated by Slit2 via targeting of miR-218. Elucidation of molecular mechanism reveals that Slit2 represses inflammatory responses by inhibiting the Pyk2-NF-κB pathway downstream of LPS-TLR4. Further studies reveal that LPS enhances endothelial inflammation by downregulating the anti-inflammatory Slit2 and Robo4 in HUVECs in vitro, as well as in arterial endothelial cells and liver in vivo during endotoxemia. These results suggest that Slit2-Robo4 signaling is important in regulating LPS-induced endothelial inflammation, and LPS, in turn, enhances inflammation by interfering with the expression of the anti-inflammatory Slit2-Robo4 during the disease state. This implies that Slit2-Robo4 is a key regulator of endothelial inflammation, and its dysregulation during endotoxemia is a novel mechanism for LPS-induced vascular pathogenesis.

abstract={ZnO/MgO double layered thin films were prepared on Al2O 3 substrate by direct current (dc) sputtering at a low power of 40 W. The effect of thickness of MgO overlayer on the properties of ZnO films was investigated. X-ray diffraction patterns revealed that the crystallinity of ZnO films can be improved by addition of a MgO overlayer. The blueshift in the PL peak suggests that the optical bandgap of ZnO can be tuned by varying the thickness of MgO overlayer. SEM micrographs revealed that the surface morphology changes from uniform to dense porous and nano-flake like structure with increase in thickness of MgO layer. Pure ZnO and optimized ZnO/MgO films were tested for their sensing performance towards H2 at different temperatures. The maximum response of ZnO and ZnO/MgO sensor was observed to be 135 and 260, respectively, at an operating temperature of 140 C. The very high sensitivity at such a low operating temperature is associated with the fast recovery time of 120 s, which could be achieved due to the promoting effect of MgO on ZnO. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.

abstract={Background Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) is currently the major therapeutic intervention in the treatment of AIDS. ART, however, is severely limited due to poor availability, high cytotoxicity, and enhanced metabolism and clearance of the drug molecules by the renal system. The use of nanocarriers encapsulating the anti-retroviral drugs may provide a solution to the aforementioned problems. Importantly, the application of mildly immunogenic polymeric carrier confers the advantage of making the nanoparticles more visible to the immune system leading to their efficient uptake by the phagocytes. Methods The saquinavir-loaded chitosan nanoparticles were characterized by transmission electron microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry and analyzed for the encapsulation efficiency, swelling characteristics, particle size properties, and the zeta potential. Furthermore, cellular uptake of the chitosan nanocarriers was evaluated using confocal microscopy and Flow cytometry. The antiviral efficacy was quantified using viral infection of the target cells. Results Using novel chitosan carriers loaded with saquinavir, a protease inhibitor, we demonstrate a drug encapsulation efficiency of 75% and cell targeting efficiency greater than 92%. As compared to the soluble drug control, the saquinavir-loaded chitosan carriers caused superior control of the viral proliferation as measured by using two different viral strains, NL4-3 and Indie-C1, and two different target T-cells, Jurkat and CEM-CCR5. Conclusion Chitosan nanoparticles loaded with saquinavir were characterized and they demonstrated superior drug loading potential with greater cell targeting efficiency leading to efficient control of the viral proliferation in target T-cells. General significance Our data ascertain the potential of chitosan nanocarriers as novel vehicles for HIV-1 therapeutics. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Salmonella enterica serovar Gallinarum is the etiological agent of fowl typhoid, which constitutes a considerable economic problem for poultry growers in developing countries. The vaccination of chickens seems to be the most effective strategy to control the disease in those areas. We constructed S. Gallinarum strains with a deletion of the global regulatory gene fur and evaluated their virulence and protective efficacy in Rhode Island Red chicks and Brown Leghorn layers. The fur deletion mutant was avirulent and, when delivered orally to chicks, elicited excellent protection against lethal S. Gallinarum challenge. It was not as effective when given orally to older birds, although it was highly immunogenic when delivered by intramuscular injection. We also examined the effect of a pmi mutant and a combination of fur deletions with mutations in the pmi and rfaH genes, which affect O-antigen synthesis, and ansB, whose product inhibits host T-cell responses. The S. Gallinarum Δpmi mutant was only partially attenuated, and the ΔansB mutant was fully virulent. The Δfur Δpmi and Δfur ΔansB double mutants were attenuated but not protective when delivered orally to the chicks. However, a Δpmi Δfur strain was highly immunogenic when administered intramuscularly. All together, our results show that the fur gene is essential for the virulence of S. Gallinarum, and the fur mutant is effective as a live recombinant vaccine against fowl typhoid. Copyright © 2014, American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={Objective: Salacia oblonga, Tinospora cordifolia, Emblica offinalis Gaertn, Curcuma longa and Gymnema sylvestre are Ayurvedic medicinal plants reported to lower plasma glucose levels in animal models. To our knowledge, however, no clinical validations of those extracts for efficacy have been. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of polyherbal combination in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Methods: We screened 250 patients enrolled in a diabetes mellitus screening camp held at District Ayurvedic Hospital, Kottayam, Kerala, India. Of these, 89 patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus and 50 healthy volunteers of similar age group were included in the study. Patients were treated with a polyherbal combination drug namely G-400 (1000mg/d) for 8wk with a follow-up of 2wk interval. Results: Fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels measured after 8 wk of G-400 treatment in patients were significantly lower. Indeed diabetic rats showed similar protection with G-400 administration. Furthermore, glycosylated hemoglobin, serum total cholesterol, both high- and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides showed a significant improvement in G-400-administered patients. Toxicologic profile of the drug was assessed by analyzing the enzyme activities of alkaline phosphatase and alanine aminotransferase along with the concentration of blood urea nitrogen and creatinine in blood and found insignificant change compared with control. Conclusion: Short-term supplementation of G-400 not only attenuates the hyperglycemia, but also acts as hypolipidemic agent in patients with diabetes. Further study should be done for the long-term effect of the drug in larger populations. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Alignment of optical components is one of the important requirements in any optical system. Decentration of a component, like a lens, in the path of the beam, would introduce aberrations of various types. This would affect the measurement accuracy in the optical system such as an interferometer. In this work, we have analyzed the influence of decentration of an optical component on the wavefront in an optical system. The various aberrations caused due to the shifting of the axis of a lens in the path of an optical wavefront have been measured using a Shack Hartmann Wavefront Sensor and their influence studied. One of the lenses in the optical system is moved or decentered in transverse direction by 500 μm in steps of 50 μm. Decentration was done for all four quadrants. For each step, wavefront data is been taken and data was analyzed. Defocus, horizontal coma, vertical coma and spherical aberration were analyzed, apart from peak-to-valley and RMS values. Results showed that the error introduced is minimal up to 300 μm decentration, above which the aberrations were quite large. The experimental results and analyses are presented. © 2014 SPIE.},

abstract={The present study was aimed at randomly mutating the microalga, Chlorella vulgaris, in order to alter its cellular behaviour towards increased lipid production for efficient biodiesel production from algal biomass. Individual mutants from ultraviolet light (UV-1 (30 s exposure), UV-2 (60 s exposure) and UV-3 (90 s exposure)) and 5′fluorodeoxyuridine (5′FDU-1 (0.25 mM) and 5′FDU-2 (0.50 mM)) exposed cells were identified to explore an alternative method for lipid enhancement. A marginally significant decrease in biomass in the UV mutants; marked increase in the lipid content in UV-2 and 5′FDU-1 mutants; significant increase in saturated fatty acids level, especially in UV-2 mutant; insignificant increase in lipid production when these mutants were subjected to an additional stress of nitrogen starvation and predominantly enhanced level of unsaturated fatty acids in all the strains except UV-2 were noted. Chloroplast ultrastructural alterations and defective biosynthesis of chloroplast specific lipid constituents were observed in the mutants. Modelling of three-dimensional structures of acetyl coA carboxylase (ACCase), omega-6, plastid delta-12 and microsomal delta-12 fatty acid desaturases for the first time and ligand-interaction studies greatly substantiated our findings. A replacement of leucine by a serine residue in the acetyl coA carboxylase gene of UV-2 mutant suggests the reason behind lipid enhancement in UV-2 mutant. Higher activity of ACCase in UV-2 and 5′FDU-1 strongly proves the functional consequences of gene mutation to lipid production. In conclusion, algal mutants exhibited significant impact on biodiesel production through structural alterations in the lipid-metabolizing genes, thereby enhancing lipid production and saturated fatty acid levels. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Background: MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that regulate post-transcriptional mRNA expression by binding to 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR) of the complementary mRNA sequence resulting in translational repression and gene silencing. They act as negative regulators of gene expression and play a pivotal role in regulating apoptosis and cell proliferation. Studies have shown that miRNAs interact with p53 by regulating the activity and function of p53 through direct repression or its regulators. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is an evolutionary conserved check point protein kinase that plays a major effect in the control of cell division via protein synthesis regulation. mTOR regulates protein synthesis through phosphorylation and inactivation of 4E-BP1 and through phosphorylation and activation of S6 kinase 1 (S6K1). These two downstream effectors of mTOR control cell growth and metabolism. In mammals, mTOR protein kinase is the central node in the nutrient and growth factor signaling and p53 plays a critical role in sensing genotoxic stress. Activation of p53 inhibits mTOR activity, which in turn regulates its downstream targets providing a cross talk among both the signaling machinery. MicroRNA-15 and 16 belong to a common precursor family and are highly conserved. Deletion or downregulation of these two microRNAs has been shown to accelerate cell division by modulating the expression of the genes involved in controlling cell cycle progression. These microRNAs may function as tumor suppressors and act on the downstream targets of p53 signaling pathway. To have a better insight of the role of miR-15/16 in regulating the cross talk of p53 and mTOR, we performed an in depth study in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells by performing a gain-of-function analysis with lentiviral plasmids expressing microRNA-15 and 16. Methods: The effect of individual microRNAs on RPS6KB1 was examined by using 3'-UTR clones via luciferase based assays. The cell cycle effects were observed by flow-cytometric analysis. Reverse transcription PCR was used to explore the expression of mTOR and RPS6KB1 in cells transfected with miR-15/16. Results: Overexpression of miR-15/16 led to inhibition of cell proliferation causing G1 cell cycle arrest as well as caspase-3 dependent apoptosis. Forced expression of miR-15/16 might lead to decrease in mRNA level of RPS6KB1, mTOR. The effect was a complete reversal after treatment with anti-miRs against miR-15/16 proving the specificity of the expression. In addition, the dual luciferase reporter assays indicated a clear decrease in luciferase gene expression in cells transfected with lentiviral based miR-15 and 16 plasmids indicating that miR-15/16 directly targets RPS6KB1 through its 3'-UTR binding. Further, these microRNAs also inhibit epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) by targeting key proteins such as Twist1 and EZH2 clearly demonstrating its crucial role in controlling cell proliferation. Conclusion: This study suggests that exogenous microRNA-15/16 can target RPS6KB1, control cell proliferation and cause apoptosis in caspase-dependent manner even in the absence of functional p53. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In the present scenario, polymers are extensively used for manufacturing of sliding components (against metals or other materials) such as gears, bearings, cams, rollers in conveyors etc. which undergo wear and tear. Thus the study of wear behaviour of polymers becomes necessary in order to enhance the life of such components. In the present research work, the adhesive wear characteristics of crystalline polymer Polyacetal (Polyoxymethylene-POM) and semi-crystalline polymer such as Nylon 6, Nylon 66 (aliphatic polyamides) were investigated. Polymers considered for this study are potential candidate materials for rollers in hybrid chains in food processing industry, medical equipments etc. Sliding wear tests were carried out under dry conditions using a pin- on-disc (ASTM G99) arrangement. The wear tests were performed against a mild steel disc (HRB 67) at room temperature under various loads (60, 80, 100N) and sliding speeds (1.8, 2.3, 2.8m/s). Cylindrical shaped polymers of 25 mm diameter were used for the wear tests. Among the three polymers, Polyacetal was observed the least wear rate and coefficient of friction irrespective of load and speed because of its crystalline nature. Nylon 6 exhibits higher frictional coefficient at higher sliding velocity. Frictional heating and subsequent local melting of the polymer apparently play a role on the wear of the polymers. © 2014 Sphinx Knowledge House. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Mesoporous copper ferrite (CuFe2O4) nanoparticles were prepared by citric acid and urea assisted combustion process. The local chemical modification obtained through addition of acid and base to the synthesis process, modifies the combustion reaction and it affects the crystalline phase, pore size and surface area of CuFe2O4 nanoparticles. The effect of grain boundary surfaces with different pore sizes on the electrical properties was explained using impedance spectroscopy results, and it was also reflected in the battery performance. The CR 2032 coin cells were fabricated using mesoporous CuFe2O4 nanoparticles with polyvinylidene difluoride (PVdF)/sodium alginate as binders; moreover, the effect of PVdF and alginate binders on the battery performance and coulombic efficiency were analyzed and were correlated to the area covered under oxidation and reduction cycles of cyclic voltammetry. CR 2032 coin cells were fabricated using mesoporous CuFe2O4 raw, acid and base samples with alginate binder and cycled at 1C rate to obtain the effect of crystallite size and surface area on the battery performance. The addition of alginate binder and its good adhesive nature improves the battery performance and retains the capacity for longer cycles. © 2014 the Partner Organisations.},

abstract={Palladium nanoparticles decorated graphene (Gra/Pd nanocomposite) was synthesized by simultaneous chemical reduction of graphene oxide and palladium salt in a single step. The negatively charged graphene oxide (GO) facilitates uniform distribution of Pd2+ ions onto its surface. The subsequent reduction by hydrazine hydrate provides well dispersed Pd nanoparticles decorated graphene. Different amount of Pd nanoparticles on graphene was synthesized by changing the volume to weight ratio of GO to PdCl2. X-ray diffraction studies showed FCC lattice of Pd with predominant (1 1 1) plane. SEM and TEM studies revealed that thin graphene nanosheets are decorated by Pd nanoparticles. Raman spectroscopic studies revealed the presence of graphene nanosheets. The electro-catalytic activity of Gra/Pd nanocomposites toward methanol and ethanol oxidation in alkaline medium was evaluated by cyclic voltammetric studies. 1:1 Gra/Pd nanocomposite exhibited good electro-catalytic activity and efficient electron transfer. The kinetics of electron transfer was studied using chronoamperometry. Improved electro-catalytic activity of 1:1 Gra/Pd nanocomposite toward alcohol oxidation makes it as a potential anode for the alcohol fuel cells. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T polymorphism shows considerable heterogeneity in its distribution in humans worldwide. The current study was conducted to investigate whether this polymorphism exhibited adaptive developmental plasticity in the control of the TT-genotype frequency. We screened 1,818 South Indian subjects (895 males and 923 females) for MTHFR C677T polymorphism using PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism approach. MTHFR 677T-allele frequency in males and females was 9.1 and 11.0%, respectively. Compared to females, males had lower frequency of TT-genotype [odds ratio 0.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08-1.01]. The frequency of MTHFR 677T-allele was highest in the age group of 20-40 years and it gradually decreased from 40-60 to 60-80 years (Ptrend &lt;0.0001). MTHFR 677TT-genotype was associated with 7.02-folds (95% CI: 2.12-25.63, P &lt; 0.0001) cumulative risk for recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL), neural tube defects (NTDs) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Linear regression model suggested that male gender exhibited increased homocysteine levels by 9.35 μmol/L while each MTHFR 677T-allele contributed to 4.63 μmol/L increase in homocysteine. Plasma homocysteine showed inverse correlation with dietary folate (r = - 0.17, P &lt; 0.0001), B2 (r = -0.14, P &lt; 0.0001) and B6 (r = -0.07, P = 0.03). Examination of the spontaneously aborted fetuses (n = 35) showed no significant association of fetal genotype on its in utero viability. From the current study, it was concluded that C677T seemed to have acquired adaptive developmental plasticity among South Indians due to environmental influences thus contributing to hyperhomocysteinemia and its associated complications such as RPL, NTDs, DVT, etc. © Springer Science+Business Media 2014.},

abstract={Aim: To ascertain whether multiple polynomial regression (MPR) has any advantage over multiple linear regression (MLR) in developing pharmacogenomic algorithms. Materials & methods: Two pharmacogenomic algorithms were developed based on MPR and MLR models from a warfarin pharmacogenomic data set (derivation cohort [n = 125] and validation cohort [n = 115]). Results: The MPR model showed better correlation with therapeutic dose (r = 0.62 vs 0.52); better diagnostic utility in distinguishing the warfarin-sensitive and warfarin-resistant patients (area under the receiver operating characteristic curves: 0.89 vs 0.81); and lower rate of underestimation (13.9 vs 20%) compared with the MLR model. Rate of overestimation was higher in the MPR than the MLR (10 vs 6.7%) model. Conclusion: The MPR approach has advantages over the MLR approach in predicting accurate and safe dose. © 2014 Future Medicine Ltd.},

abstract={Obesity, genetic polymorphisms of xenobiotic metabolic pathway, hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes, and hypomethylation of proapoptotic genes are known to be independent risk factors for breast cancer. The objective of this study is to evaluate the combined effect of these environmental, genetic, and epigenetic risk factors on the susceptibility to breast cancer. PCR-RFLP and multiplex PCR were used for the genetic analysis of six variants of xenobiotic metabolic pathway. Methylation-specific PCR was used for the epigenetic analysis of four genetic loci. Multifactor dimensionality reduction analysis revealed a significant interaction between the body mass index (BMI) and catechol-O-methyl transferase H108L variant alone or in combination with cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A1m1 variant. Women with "Luminal A" breast cancer phenotype had higher BMI compared to other phenotypes and healthy controls. There was no association between the BMI and tumor grade. The post-menopausal obese women exhibited lower glutathione levels. BMI showed a positive association with the methylation of extracellular superoxide dismutase (r = 0.21, p < 0.05), Ras-association (RalGDS/AF-6) domain family member 1 (RASSF1A) (r = 0.31, p < 0.001), and breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein (r = 0.19, p < 0.05); and inverse association with methylation of BNIP3 (r = -0.48, p < 0.0001). To conclude based on these results, obesity increases the breast cancer susceptibility by two possible mechanisms: (i) by interacting with xenobiotic genetic polymorphisms in inducing increased oxidative DNA damage and (ii) by altering the methylome of several tumor suppressor genes. © Springer Science+Business 2014.},

abstract={Mitochondrial morphology is regulated by conserved proteins involved in fusion and fission processes. The mammalian Optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) that functions in mitochondrial fusion is associated with Optic Atrophy and has been implicated in inner membrane cristae remodeling during cell death. Here, we show Drosophila Optic atrophy 1-like (Opa1-like) influences mitochondrial morphology through interaction with 'mitochondria-shaping' proteins like Mitochondrial assembly regulatory factor (Marf) and Drosophila Mitofilin (dMitofilin). To gain an insight into Opa1-like's network, we delineated bonafide interactors like dMitofilin, Marf, Serine protease High temperature requirement protein A2 (HTRA2), Rhomboid-7 (Rho-7) along with novel interactors such as Mortalin ortholog (Hsc70-5) from Drosophila mitochondrial extract. Interestingly, RNAi mediated down-regulation of hsc70-5 in Drosophila wing imaginal disc's peripodial cells resulted in fragmented mitochondria with reduced membrane potential leading to proteolysis of Opa1-like. Increased ecdysone activity induced dysfunctional fragmented mitochondria for clearance through lysosomes, an effect enhanced in hsc70-5 RNAi leading to increased cell death. Over-expression of Opa1-like rescues mitochondrial morphology and cell death in prepupal tissues expressing hsc70-5 RNAi. Taken together, we have identified a novel interaction between Hsc70-5/Mortalin and Opa1-like that influences cellular homeostasis through mitochondrial fusion. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={This prospective study was done in 32 fractures or bone defects of tibia. After fracture debridement, Ilizarov external fixator with Teflon coated carbon rings were applied in consenting patients. DC voltage is applied to the K- wires passed through the bone above and below the fracture site in steps of 0.1 V and the current is recorded for each step voltages (0.1, 0.2.1.0 V). The current was plotted in a graph versus the days of treatment and simultaneously compared with alongside X-rays. All the 32 cases which exhibited a stabilization of current flow with a fixed current value possibly point to the calcification of callus and consequential strengthening of tissue in the fracture site. This also coincided with the radiological and clinical healing. The disarray electrical environment in the early callus stabilized (asymptotic) when the fracture healed. We analyzed the association between current recorded across the fractured limb and fracture configuration. There were three types of graphs matching three fracture patterns. The types of the graphs differed with shape of the fracture and stage of healing, with irregularity increasing when fracture ends had unstable fracture configuration.},

The antibacterial activity of the marine algae was done by using agar cup plate method and MIC method. Lipase inhibitory action of various concentrations of methanolic extract of these marine algae was estimated using olive oil as substrate and there by antiobesity action was determined. Results: The marine algae extracts of S.platensis showed better activity against Staphylococcus aureus but the G. corticata showed better activity against Bacillus compared with the other organisms. Minimal inhibitory concentration was observed at the concentration of 250μl for all micro-organisms. Conclusion: The marine algae extracts of S. platensis showed better inhibition of lipase activity compared with G. corticata showed low lipase inhibition activity.},

abstract={This paper presents development of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) regression, driven by a Radial Basis Function kernel for obtaining the composition of boiler flue gas mixtures. The frequency components of various gas mixtures were first processed by Floyd K - Means algorithm and the data with class labels were utilized to build a multi-class SVM regression model for discrimination of the flue gas constituents and subsequent composition finding. The Meta parameters (C, ε and kernel) are optimized using grid search technique to obtain appropriate support vectors to train the network. After ascertaining the performance of proposed technique through volatile organic component (VOC) data acquired from quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) type sensors used by earlier researchers, detailed studies have been carried out to study the discriminating and estimation capability of the proposed technique for real time flue gas data acquired from two different analyzers namely ORSATR and KANE. Exhaustive studies clearly indicate the exceptional performance of the proposed SVM model in classifying and estimating the flue gas components in machine (Analyzer) independent manner.},

abstract={The developmental index and the developmental planning of a Country/Nation mostly depend on its natural resources potential including water resources. The emerging of Remote Sensing and GIs has substantially reduced the problems of groundwater targeting in various aquifer systems. The groundwater aquifer system in Pudukkottai district is distinctly controlled by western crystalline, central Tertiary sandstone and eastern Quaternary sediments. While the groundwater behavior in crystalline is dominantly controlled by secondary porosity, in Tertiary formation and Quaternary sediments, it is controlled by the primary porosity. The analysis of groundwater levels of 1975, 1985 and 1995 under the 3D GIs environment and their integrations show that the groundwater system in Pudukkottai district is also controlled by the major tectonic features deduced from tectonic and fluvial geomorphological anomalies. The groundwater domes and basins are alternatively aligned in NW-SE direction in western crystalline segment and the groundwater ridge and valley is found in tertiary formation shows the N-S alignment. The groundwater ridge aligned along Gandavarvakkottai-Alangudi indicates that the groundwater movements obstructed by the upliftment of Mio-Pliocene sandstone in between the two N-S faults. The alternatively arranged groundwater ridge and valley in western crystalline are dominantly controlled by the NW-SE major lineamentsl faults. The present study revealed that groundwater aquifer system in this repon is also controlled by the tectonic grains. © 2014 Knowledpa Review, Malaysia.},

abstract={The vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons to environmental exposures in sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD) has been attributed to altered detoxification by xenobiotic metabolizing genes. Hence, we investigated the influence of genetic polymorphisms in xenobiotic metabolic pathway (CYP1A1 m1, CYP1A1 m2, CYP1A1 m4, COMT p.H108L, GSTT1, and GSTM1) on the susceptibility to PD. We used PCR-RFLP for CYP1A1 and COMT genotyping; multiplex-PCR for GSTT1 and GSTM1 deletion analysis; and spectrophotometric methods to evaluate the oxidative stress markers. Results showed association of CYP1A1 m1 (OR: 2.38, 95 % CI: 1.76-3.22) and COMT p.H108L (OR: 2.08 95 % CI: 1.56-2.77) polymorphisms with risk for PD. Male patients carrying combination of COMT p.H108L and CYP1A1 m1 variant alleles showed an early onset of the disease. There was a significant increase in oxidative stress makers such as malondialdehyde and protein carbonyls; and decrease in glutathione levels in PD cases compared to controls (P < 0.05). To conclude, CYP1A1 m1, COMT p.H108L polymorphisms were associated with PD risk, and sexual dimorphism was observed in these associations. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={To analyse fracture healing repeated X-rays are needed increasing the problem of radiation. Though already Electric Current is used widely in therapeutic aspect to accelerate fracture healing, only recently it has been tried as a diagnostic tool in assessing fracture healing. To study conduction across a fracture the first step is to devise a suitable simulated structural support for fracture in fractured limb. For this, two Ilizarov rings of stainless steel are connected by wooden rulers. The distance between these rings are adjusted to be 4 cm and 6 cm. The Direct Current voltage is applied between the K-wires fixed to each of these circular rings and current output measured in different solutions like tap water, de-mineralized water, Sodium chloride solutions of different concentrations, glycerol and heparinised domestic goat's blood. It was found that the relationship between voltage applied and current recorded across two wires of an Ilizarov ring kept in electrolyte solutions and goat's blood up to 1 volt was linear. This method will be of use in measuring such electric conduction between wires passed across a fracture during its healing period. Such models being inexpensive can also use to teach electric conduction to students.},

abstract={A solar drier assisted with evacuated tube collector is designed and developed to study and examine the drying Kinetics of muscat grapes in Thanjavur, Tamilnadu, India. During the drying period, temperature at various places, relative humidity, wind velocity and mass of the sample are measured on hourly basis. The outlet temperature of the collector and temperature within the chamber varies from 74-130 oC and 50- 87 °C respectively, while the ambient temperature ranges from 29.5-33.2 °C. Solar insulation recorded during these days ranges from 155.6-1115 W/m2. The designed drier takes 14 hours to reduce the moisture content of muscat grapes from 78% to 9.5% (wb) to ensure safe storage. It is found that the whole drying process exists in falling-rate period. The maximum drier efficiency for muscat grapes is found to be 29.92% during the drying period. Six thin-layer drying models have been used to fit the experimental moisture ratio obtained for muscat grapes by nonlinear regression analysis using IBM SPSS 20 statistical package. According to the results, Page model shows a good fit with highest correlation (R2 = 0.991), lowest reduced chi-square (χ2 = 0.001) and lowest root mean square error (RMSE = 0.0297).},

abstract={Cement production became an intense energy consumptive activity which produces green house gases and finding a suitable substitute is an important research task in the present scenario. It is also to be noted that temperature also plays a vital role in rate of strength gain. Hence in this paper an attempt has been made to study the effect of thermal curing on strength characteristics of GGBFS based concrete. Concrete with characteristic compressive strength of 20 MPa was chosen for the present study. Concrete specimens were cast with 20%, 30% and 40% replacement of cement with GGBFS and were cured under different curing conditions like hot water and hot air oven. The specimens were exposed to three different temperatures, namely 40°C, 50°C and 60°C for four hours in hot water curing. Compression test and split tensile test were conducted on concrete cubes and cylinders respectively. From the results it was inferred that higher percentage replacement of cement with GGBFS yielded considerable increase in both tensile and compressive strength of the resulting concrete. It was found that replacement of cement with 40% of GGBFS under hot water curing at 60°C temperature has yielded maximum compressive and tensile strength of concrete.},

abstract={A vertex-edge dominating set of a graph G is a set D of vertices of G such that every edge of G is incident with a vertex of D or a vertex adjacent to a vertex of D. The vertex-edge domination number of a graph G, denoted by γve(T), is the minimum cardinality of a vertex-edge dominating set of G. We prove that for every tree T of order n≥3 with l leaves and s support vertices, we have (n-l-s+3)/4≤γve(T)≤n/3, and we characterize the trees attaining each of the bounds. © 2014 Académie des sciences.},

abstract={The optimization of dry sliding wear process parameters of in-situ aluminium based metal matrix composites to obtain multiple objectives to minimize wear rate, specific wear rate, co-efficient of friction and maximize wear resistance was attempted by Taguchi Grey Relational Analysis. Moreover to identify the significance of the parameters, a statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance. Based on the analysis, the sliding speed was identified as the major contributor with 71.41% followed by percentage of reinforcement with 8.13% and other parameters load and sliding distance are found to be insignificant. The optimum parameters identified by the Grey Relational Analysis are verified through experimental confirmation test. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={The main aim of this work was to formulate the leaf extract of Pothos scandens in to an emulgel and investigate their burn wound healing activity. Ethanolic extract of dried leaves of Pothos scandens were subjected to preliminary phytochemical evaluation and wound healing activities studies. Emulgel formulations were prepared using three types of gelling agents: Carbopol 934, Carbopol 940 and HPMC K 4 M. The influence of the type of the gelling agent on the drug release from the prepared emulgel was investigated. The prepared emulgel were evaluated for their physical appearance, pH, viscosity, spreadability, in vitro drug release, pharmacological activity and stability. It was finally concluded that the formulation F1 with 1%w/w Carbopol 940 was found to be more promising formulations as it shows better physicochemical characteristics and higher pharmacological activity compared to other formulations. Herbal emulgel of ethanolic extract of Pothos scandens shows significant improvement in burn wound contraction and hence this is a promising candidate in burn wound healing.},

abstract={Naga bhasma is one of the herbo-metallic preparations used in Ayurveda, a traditional Indian System of Medicine. The preparation of Naga bhasma involves thermal treatment of ′Naga′ (metallic lead) in a series of quenching liquids, followed by reaction with realgar and herbal constituents, before calcination to prepare a fine product. We have analysed the intermediates obtained during different stages of preparation to understand the relevance and importance of different steps involved in the preparation. Our results show that ′Sodhana′ (purification process) removes heavy metals other than lead, apart from making it soft and amenable for trituration. The use of powders of tamarind bark and peepal bark maintains the oxidation state of lead in Jarita Naga (lead oxide) as Pb 2+. The repeated calcination steps result in the formation of nano-crystalline lead sulphide, the main chemical species present in Naga bhasma.},

abstract={Objective: Rubia cordifolia (RC) is an important medicinal plant which is used for treatment of various ailments in ayurvedic system of medicine. However its cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in abrogation of liver tumor metastasis has not been proved experimentally. The purpose of this study was to investigate the anti-metastatic effect of RC in N-Nitrosodiethylamine (DEN) induced hepatocarcinogenesis. Methods: In this study, DEN (0.02% in drinking water) induced rats were co-treated with RC extract (500 mg/kg body weight) for 90 days to mitigate the tumor invasion potential of the carcinogen. Serum and plasma was collected and subjected to biochemical estimation of hydroxyproline, glycoprotein (hexose, hexosamines and sialic acid) and plasma lysosomal enzymes (β-Galactosidase and N-acetyl -β-D-glucosaminidase). Expression of MMP-2 (matrix metalloproteinase-2) and SPARC (secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine) in liver and kidney tissue was confirmed by zymography, western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Results: The serum levels of sugar components of glycoproteins and plasma level lysosomal enzymes were found to be increased upon administration of DEN to rats, but significantly lowered on oral supplementation of RC extract (500 mg/kg). Western blots of MMP-2 and SPARC in liver and kidney confirmed their up-regulation in DEN-induced animals when compared to control. Expression levels of both proteins were down-regulated in case of RC supplemented animals, when compared to DEN-induced animals favoring attenuation of tumor invasion. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that RC extract possessed anti-cancer properties favoring attenuation of DEN-induced tumor invasion.},

abstract={Background: The current study was aimed to elucidate the association of thymidylate synthase (TYMS) 5'-UTR 28bp tandem repeat and cytosolic serine hydroxymethyltransferase (cSHMT) C1420T polymorphisms with acute leukemia in South Indian subjects. A total of 812 subjects [523 healthy controls, 148 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases and 141 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases] were screened for TYMS 5'-UTR 28bp tandem repeat and cSHMT C1420T using PCR-AFLP and PCR-with confronting two-pair primers (CTPP) approaches. TYMS 5'-UTR 2R allele frequencies of controls, ALL and AML cases were 35.3%, 28.0% and 30.1% respectively. This polymorphism conferred protection against ALL (OR: 0.71, 95%CI: 0.53-0.96) while showing no statistically significant association with AML (OR: 0.79, 95%CI: 0.58, 1.07). The cSHMT variant allele (T-) frequencies of ALL and AML cases (6.42% and 5.68% respectively) were significantly lower compared to controls (58.3%). This polymorphism conferred protection against ALL (OR: 0.049, 95%CI: 0.029-0.081) and AML (OR: 0.043, 95%CI: 0.025-0.074). The TYMS 5'-UTR 2R2R genotype was associated with a lower total leukocyte count, smaller percentage of blasts, and more adequate platelet count compared to 2R3R and 3R3R genotypes in ALL cases. No such genotype-dependent differences were observed in AML cases. ALL cases carrying the cSHMT C1420T polymorphism showed higher disease free survival compared to those with the wild genotype. To conclude, the TYMS 5'-UTR 28bp tandem repeat reduces risk for ALL while cSHMT C1420T reduces risk for both ALL and AML. Both also influence disease progression in ALL.},

abstract={Cardiovascular disease is common and prevalent in most human community and is vital reasons of morbidity and mortality. It still remains a dreadful disease, hence speedy and accurate diagnosis of Heart Disease (HD) is essential. Artificial neural network provides a powerful tool to help the medical professionals to clinically analyze the disease and get the best solutions. The aim of this paper is to make best use of Multilayer Feed Forward Neural Network (MLFFNN) using Back Propagation (BP) algorithm and Associative Neural Network (ASNN) for the effective diagnosis of Heart Disease. The MLFFNN is configured with 13, 20 and 1 neurons in the input, hidden and output layer. The ASNN is configured with 13, 10 and 1 neurons in the input, hidden and output layer. 270 datasets are used for training. The performance of both Neural Networks is analyzed in training and predicting the heart diseases. MLFFNN predicts heart disease with the excellent correlation co-efficient (R2) = 0.9410 and 0.9999 for training and testing. ASSN provides satisfactory results with the correlation co-efficient (R2) = 0.9999 for training and 0.9460 for testing. The results are cross validated by Leave-One-Out (LOO) procedure. The performance of MLFFNN is compared with ASNN. MLFFNN predict heart disease with better accuracy than ASNN for test dataset. The results so obtained have proved that the intricate and significant task of heart disease prediction can be carried out precisely and effectively using this automated medical diagnosis system.},

abstract={This paper discusses the determination of calcium in wine samples using Programmable Systemon-Chip (PSoC) microcontroller. This embedded system uses a PSoC CY8C27443 integrated circuit (IC) spectrophotometer as core unit, high intensity orange LED as light source and photodiode as light detector having the relative spectral sensitivity above 93% in the range of 550-650 nm. This single-chip design reduces hardware complexity and increases the stability by miniaturizing the device. The instrument obeys Beer's law up to the concentration of 160 mg/L. Coloring agent Methylthymol Blue (MTB) forms a complex with calcium in presence of alkali (pH ≈ 12); the complex exhibits maximum absorbance at 610 nm. The spectral range, concentration of MTB and pH of the solution at which the reaction is carried out are optimized. The results of the developed method are compared statistically with those obtained by a conventional method by applying Student's t-test and F-test. The regression analysis reveals excellent correlation (R 2 = 0.9998) and regression line equation obtained for that line Y = 0.29 + 0.99X with standard error of 0.62. It can be concluded that the obtained results are in good agreement with the reference method at 95% confidence level. © 2014 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

abstract={5′ Nucleotidase (5′ NUC) is a ubiquitously distributed enzyme known to be present in snake venoms (SV) that is responsible primarily for causing dysregulation of physiological homeostasis in humans by inducing anticoagulant effects and by inhibiting platelet aggregation. It is also known to act synergistically with other toxins to exert a more pronounced anti-coagulant effect during envenomation. Its structural and functional role is not yet ascertained clearly. The 3D structure of snake venom 5′ nucleotidase (SV-5′ NUC) is not yet known and was predicted by us for the first time using a comparative homology modeling approach using Demansia vestigiata protein sequence. The accuracy and stability of the predicted SV-5′ NUC structure were validated using several computational approaches. Key interactions of SV-5′ NUC were studied using experimental studies/molecular docking analysis of the inhibitors vanillin, vanillic acid and maltol. All these inhibitors were found to dock favorably following pharmacologically relevant absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) profiles. Further, atomic level docking interaction studies using inhibitors of the SV-5′ NUC active site revealed amino acid residues Y65 and T72 as important for inhibitor-(SV-5′ NUC) interactions. Our in silico analysis is in good agreement with experimental inhibition results of SV-5′ NUC with vanillin, vanillic acid and maltol. The present study should therefore play a guiding role in the experimental design of new SV-5′ NUC inhibitors for snake bite management. We also identified a few pharmacophoric features essential for SV-5′ NUC inhibitory activity that can be utilized further for the discovery of putative anti-venom agents of therapeutic value for snake bite management. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Flavonoids are widely distributed in Plant Kingdom that act as free radical scavengers and play a vital role in combating various diseases through their antioxidant property. An attempt was made to evaluate the antioxidant property of free and bound flavonoids present in Wrightia tinctoria (Roxb) R. Br. leaves (Apocynaceae). An initial estimation of total phenolic and flavonoid content after methanolic extraction of powdered leaves of Wrightia tinctoria (Roxb) R. Br. was done. Total phenolic content of 30.17 ± 2.36 mg/g (gallic acid equivalents/g of dry extract) and total flavonoid content of 21.33 ± 0.94 mg/g (quercetin equivalents/g dry extract) was obtained when estimated through Folin Ciocalteu reagent method and aluminum chloride colorimetric method respectively. The total antioxidant activity (by determination of phosphomolybdenum reduction) was found to be maximum [86.56 ± 2.20 mg/g (ascorbic acid equivalents/g of dry extract)] for free flavonoid fraction obtained from the methanolic extract when compared to the bound flavonoid extract (43.88 ± 2.56 mg/g). This result indicates that the polyphenols present in free flavonoid extract may be responsible for the enhanced activity. Wrightia tinctoria (Roxb) R. Br. is used for the treatment of skin infections since time immemorial and this finding on its antioxidant property documents a possible contributing mechanism by which it heals skin infections and provides an evidence for presence of polyphenols and free flavonoids in large quantity in its leaves.},

abstract={Protein domains are functionally and structurally independent modules, which add to the functional variety of proteins. This array of functional diversity has been enabled by evolutionary changes, such as amino acid substitutions or insertions or deletions, occurring in these protein domains. Length variations (indels) can introduce changes at structural, functional and interaction levels. LenVarDB (freely available at http://caps.ncbs.res.in/ lenvardb/) traces these length variations, starting from structure-based sequence alignments in our Protein Alignments organized as Structural Superfamilies (PASS2) database, across 731 structural classification of proteins (SCOP)-based protein domain superfamilies connected to 2 730 625 sequence homologues. Alignment of sequence homologues corresponding to a structural domain is available, starting from a structure-based sequence alignment of the superfamily. Orientation of the length-variant (indel) regions in protein domains can be visualized by mapping them on the structure and on the alignment. Knowledge about location of length variations within protein domains and their visual representation will be useful in predicting changes within structurally or functionally relevant sites, which may ultimately regulate protein function. Non-technical summary: Evolutionary changes bring about natural changes to proteins that may be found in many organisms. Such changes could be reflected as amino acid substitutions or insertions-deletions (indels) in protein sequences. LenVarDB is a database that provides an early overview of observed length variations that were set among 731 protein families and after examining >2 million sequences. Indels are followed up to observe if they are close to the active site such that they can affect the activity of proteins. Inclusion of such information can aid the design of bioengineering experiments. © 2013 The Author(s). Published by Oxford University Press.},

abstract={The activating mutations of the Ras gene or other abnormalities in Ras signaling pathway lead to uncontrolled growth factor-independent proliferation of hematopoietic progenitors. Oncogenic mutations in NRAS gene have been observed with variable prevalence in hematopoietic malignancies. In the present study, NRAS mutations were detected using bidirectional sequencing in 264 acute leukemia cases — 129 acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and 135 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 245 age- and gender-matched controls. Missense mutation was observed only in the 12th codon of NRAS gene in 4.7% of AML and 3.16% of ALL cases. The presence of NRAS mutation did not significantly influence blast % and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in AML patients. When the data were analyzed with respect to clinical variables, the total leukocyte count was elevated for mutation positive group, compared to negative group. In AML patients with NRAS mutations, 60% failed to achieve complete remission (CR), as compared to 34.8% in mutation negative group. These results indicated that NRAS mutations might confer poor drug response. In AML, disease free survival (DFS) in NRAS mutation positive group was lesser, compared to mutation negative group (9.5 months vs. 11.68 months). In ALL patients, DFS of NRAS mutation positive group was lesser than mutation negative group (9.2 months vs. 27.5 months). The CR rate was also lower for mutation-positive patients group, compared to mutation-negative group. In conclusion, these results suggested that presence of NRAS mutation at 12th codon was associated with poor response and poorer DFS in both ALL and AML. © 2014, National Institute of Science Communication and Information Resources (NISCAIR).

abstract={Several epidemiologic studies have suggested an association between the Parkinson’s disease (PD) and exposure to heavy metals, such as lead, iron, copper, manganese, etc. A growing body of evidence suggests that heavy metals stimulate free radical formation in the brain and can lead to neurodegeneration. In the present study, we investigated whether such association exists in PD cases from rural and urban areas in our study population. The plasma levels of copper, iron, manganese and lead in PD cases (n = 150) and controls (n = 170) were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and correlated with the oxidative stress markers like malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyl and total glutathione. Results indicated significant increase in the levels of copper (17.73 ± 4.48 vs. 13.0 ± 3.22 ng/ml) and iron (554.4 ± 123.8 vs. 421.7 ± 126.1 ng/ml) in PD cases compared to controls, whereas no significant differences in the levels of manganese and lead were observed. Further, the data based on urban or rural residence showed that plasma copper, iron, manganese levels were comparatively higher in rural subjects, whereas plasma lead levels were significantly higher in urban subjects. Increased plasma iron showed positive correlation with marker of lipid peroxidation (MDA), suggesting that increased iron levels induced oxidative stress in PD. These results substantiated the earlier observations about the role of environmental exposure and metal-induced oxidative stress in the etiology of PD. © 2014, National Institute of Science Communication and Information Resources (NISCAIR).

abstract={Death-associated protein kinase (DAPK) is a serine-threonine kinase with tumor suppressor function. Previously, we demonstrated that tumor necrosis factor (TNF) induced DAPK-mediated apoptosis in colorectal cancer. However, the protein-protein interaction network associated with TNF-DAPK signaling still remains unclear. We identified HSF1 as a new DAPK phosphorylation target in response to low concentrations of TNF and verified a physical interaction between DAPK and HSF1 both in vitro and in vivo. We show that HSF1 binds to the DAPK promoter. Transient overexpression of HSF1 protein led to an increase in DAPK mRNA level and consequently to an increase in the amount of apoptosis. By contrast, treatment with a DAPK-specific inhibitor as well as DAPK knockdown abolished the phosphorylation of HSF1 at Ser230 (pHSF1Ser230). Furthermore, translational studies demonstrated a positive correlation between DAPK and pHSF1Ser230 protein expression in human colorectal carcinoma tissues. Taken together, our data define a novel link between DAPK and HSF1 and highlight a positive-feedback loop in DAPK regulation under mild inflammatory stress conditions in colorectal tumors. For the first time, we show that under TNF the pro-survival HSF1 protein can be redirected to a proapoptotic program. © 2014.},

abstract={The present study was designed to investigate the antinociceptive potential of Vernonia cinerea (VC) on vincristine-induced painful neuropathy in rats. A chemotherapeutic agent, vincristine (50 μg/kg intraperitoneally for 10 consecutive days), was administered for the induction of neuropathic pain in rats. The painful behavioral changes were assessed using hot plate, acetone drop, paw pressure, Von Frey hair and tail immersion tests to assess the degree of hyperalgesic and allodynic pain sensation in paw and tail. Tissue biomarker changes including  thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARSs), reduced glutathione (GSH) and total calcium levels were estimated in sciatic nerve tissue samples to assess the degree of oxidative stress. Histopathological changes were also observed in transverse sections of rat sciatic nerve tissue. Ethanolic extract of VC leaves and pregabalin were administered for 14 consecutive days from day 0 (day of surgery). Pregabalin served as a positive control in the present study. Vincristine administration resulted in a significant reduction in painful behavioral changes along with a rise in the levels of TBARS, total calcium and decrease in GSH levels when compared with the normal control group. Furthermore, significant histopathological changes were also observed. Pretreatment with VC significantly attenuated vincristine-induced development of painful behavioral, biochemical and histological changes in a dose-dependent manner, which is similar to that of pregabalin-pretreated group. The attenuating effect of VC in vincristine-induced nociceptive painful sensation may be due to its potential of antioxidative, neuroprotective and calcium channel inhibitory action. © 2012, SAGE Publications.

X-ray diffraction patterns of the prepared films revealed the formation of CuO thin films having monoclinic structure with a grain size ranging from 35 to 54 nm. The microstrain and dislocation densities are found to decrease with increase in molar concentration. The surface morphology and the elemental composition of the deposited samples were analyzed using SEM and EDAX. The change in resistivity of the films was studied with respect to the change in temperature using two probe method. From Laser Raman spectral studies, the characteristic Raman peaks of the prepared samples were observed.

abstract={High conservation of glycyl residues in homologous proteins is fairly frequent. It is commonly understood that glycine tends to be highly conserved either because of its unique Ramachandran angles or to avoid steric clash that would arise with a larger side chain. Using a database of aligned 3D structures of homologous proteins we identified conserved Gly in 288 alignment positions from 85 families. Ninety-Six of these alignment positions correspond to conserved Gly residue with (Φ, Ψ) values allowed for non-glycyl residues. Reasons for this observation were investigated by in-Silico mutation of these glycyl residues to Ala. We found in 94% of the cases a short contact exists between the Cb atom of the introduced Ala with the atoms which are often distant in the primary structure. This suggests the lack of space even for a short side chain thereby explaining high conservation of glycyl residues even when they adopt (Φ, Ψ) values allowed for Ala. In 189 alignment positions, the conserved glycyl residues adopt values which are disallowed for Ala. In-Silico mutation of these Gly residues to Ala almost always results in steric hindrance involving Cb atom of Ala as one would expect by comparing Ramachandran maps for Ala and Gly. Rare occurrence of the disallowed glycyl conformations even in ultrahigh resolution protein structures are accompanied by short contacts in the crystal structures and such disallowed conformations are not conserved in the homologues. These observations raise the doubt on the accuracy of such glycyl conformations in proteins. ©2014 The Protein Society.},

abstract={Degenerative conditions are associated with free radical-induced oxidative damages in the mitochondrial paraphernalia. Antimycin A (AMA) treatment of cells mimics such conditions in vitro by augmentation in ROS levels, thus causing injury to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), proteins and lipids, along with depolarization of mitochondrial membrane, activation of pro-apoptotic factors, resulting in apoptosis. This study investigates the potential of aqueous and methanolic extracts of Lawsonia inermis in prevention of such oxidative damage to the cell homeostasis. The extracts significantly mitigated membrane damages induced by peroxide, along with substantial decline in AMA-induced degeneration of mitochondrial proteins and lipids in hepatic carcinoma (Hep3B) cells. mtDNA analyzed for oxidative damage by assaying for 8-OHdG revealed considerable protective effect of both extracts against AMA-induced mtDNA damage. SQ-PCR of selected mtDNA genes confirmed that both extracts alleviated amplitudes of mtDNA injury. FACS analysis with JC-1 dye established that both extracts maintained homeostasis of mitochondrial membrane potential in AMA-treated cells. Extract treatments caused decline in AMA-induced discharge of cytochrome c and AIF into the cytoplasm along with consequent subjugation of apoptosis. All activities of the extracts reported in the present study significantly (P< 0.05) correlated to their total phenolic contents, thereby proving that polyphenolic constituents of the extracts alleviate cells from oxidative stress-induced injury. © 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

abstract={Rabies claims about 55 000 human lives and many hundreds of thousands of livestock every year, worldwide. Despite a heavy disease burden, laboratory facilities to diagnose the infection remain scarce in most countries of the developing world where the disease is endemic. Rapid Fluorescent Focus Inhibition Test (RFFIT) and Fluorescent Antibody Virus Neutralization Test (FAVN) are the common tests done in the rabies diagnostic laboratories to detect and quantitate Rabies Virus Neutralizing Antibodies (RVNA). RFFIT is most often employed in confirming seroconversion following prophylactic vaccination, and to aid ante-mortem diagnosis in suspected cases of rabies. Though this remains one of the most soughtafter diagnostic services in rabies laboratories, the requirements for expensive anti-rabies fluorochrome antibody conjugate and a fluorescent microscope restrict its performance to only a few reference laboratories. Cost-effective laboratory diagnostic methods employing affordable technology are a need of the hour in the rabies-endemic countries. In this study we have developed a new immunohistochemistry-based neutralization test and extensively evaluated it along with RFFIT. One hundred and 20 human serum samples collected after post-exposure vaccination were subjected to both the tests for determining RVNA titers. The results obtained with the new test correlated significantly with those of RFFIT. Further validation of the inter- and intra- assay precision, lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) and specificity was also performed. The best correlation between the 2 methods, however, was observed only when the RVNA concentrations in the samples were >20 IU/mL. Overall, the immunohistrochemistry-based neutralization test yielded satisfactory results. We suggest that it might serve as a cost-effective alternative to RFFIT in low-resource settings in the developing countries. © 2014 Landes Bioscience.},

The crystallite size of CuO nanostructures was estimated to be ∼10 nm using Debye-Scherrer's formula. The uniform and nanoregime grains were observed in SEM micrographs. The optical band gap value was estimated to be 1.2 eV using Tauc's plot. The Raman scattering investigations revealed Ag and Bg mode peaks at 278 cm-1, 332 cm-1 and 618 cm-1, respectively.

abstract={Several epidemiologic studies have suggested an association between the Parkinson's disease (PD) and exposure to heavy metals, such as lead, iron, copper, manganese, etc. A growing body of evidence suggests that heavy metals stimulate free radical formation in the brain and can lead to neurodegeneration. In the present study, we investigated whether such association exists in PD cases from rural and urban areas in our study population. The plasma levels of copper, iron, manganese and lead in PD cases (n = 150) and controls (n = 170) were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and correlated with the oxidative stress markers like malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyl and total glutathione. Results indicated significant increase in the levels of copper (17.73 ± 4.48 vs. 13.0 ± 3.22 ng/ml) and iron (554.4 ± 123.8 vs. 421.7 ± 126.1 ng/ml) in PD cases compared to controls, whereas no significant differences in the levels of manganese and lead were observed. Further, the data based on urban or rural residence showed that plasma copper, iron, manganese levels were comparatively higher in rural subjects, whereas plasma lead levels were significantly higher in urban subjects. Increased plasma iron showed positive correlation with marker of lipid peroxidation (MDA), suggesting that increased iron levels induced oxidative stress in PD. These results substantiated the earlier observations about the role of environmental exposure and metal-induced oxidative stress in the etiology of PD.},

abstract={The objective of this study was to develop chitosan-based delivery of cobalt oxide nanoparticles to human leukemic cells and investigate their specific induction of apoptosis. The physicochemical properties of the chitosan-coated cobalt oxide nanoparticles were characterized using transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, X-ray diffraction, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The solubility of chitosan-coated cobalt oxide nanoparticles was higher at acidic pH, which helps to release more cobalt ions into the medium. Chitosan-coated cobalt oxide nanoparticles showed good compatibility with normal cells. However, our results showed that exposure of leukemic cells (Jurkat cells) to chitosan-coated cobalt oxide nanoparticles caused an increase in reactive oxygen species generation that was abolished by pretreatment of cells with the reactive oxygen species scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine. The apoptosis of Jurkat cells was confirmed by flow-cytometric analysis. Induction of TNF-α secretion was observed from stimulation of Jurkat cells with chitosan-coated cobalt oxide nanoparticles. We also tested the role of TNF-α in the induction of Jurkat cell death in the presence of TNF-α and caspase inhibitors. Treatment of leukemic cells with a blocker had a greater effect on cancer cell viability. From our findings, oxidative stress and caspase activation are involved in cancer cell death induced by chitosan-coated cobalt oxide nanoparticles. © SBIC 2014.},

abstract={This paper discusses the mechanical behavior of La0.2Sr 0.8Fe0.6Ti0.4O3-δ (LSFT)-Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-δ (CGO) (40:60 vol%) dual-phase ceramic membranes at elevated temperatures in ambient air and slightly reducing conditions. Fracture strength of the LSTF-CGO membranes was observed to decrease upon exposure to increasing reducing conditions. Changes associated with the oxygen stoichiometry at elevated temperatures in the N 2 environment were shown to play a significant role in the fracture behavior of dual-phase membranes. In actual application environments-for example, in a reactor, where the pO2 may vary from 0.2 to 10 -14 atm-the mechanical stability of this type of dual-phase membrane primarily depends on the distribution of residual stresses arising from differential chemical/thermal expansion of the individual phases. The present study is of immense importance for anyone designing dual-phase ceramic membranes of LSFT-CGO for pertinent applications. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.},

abstract={The pathogenesis of glycerol-induced myoglobinuric acute renal failure involves ischemia, vascular congestion and reactive oxygen metabolites. In this study, we have investigated for the first time, the role of ferulic acid in attenuating glycerol-induced nephrotoxicity. Male Wistar rats were injected intramuscularly with 8mL/kg body weight of 50% glycerol, glycerol+ferulic acid at the dose of 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25mg/kg body weight. After 24h, the rats were sacrificed and the kidneys were removed for histological and immunohistochemical studies. Furthermore, determinations of lipid peroxidation (LPO) as well as antioxidant enzymes were also analyzed; blood, urine samples were collected in order to quantify renal function and nitric oxide generation, respectively. Glycerol-induced rats showed a significant increase in the level of urinary markers assessed in serum as well as kidney and these were reversed upon ferulic acid treatment. A significant increase in urine nitric oxide, serum as well as kidney LPO, decrease in activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione-S-transferase and reduced glutathione were observed in glycerol-induced rats. Immunohistochemical study in glycerol-induced rats demonstrated an increase in the level of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB). All these effects induced by glycerol were reduced upon treatment with ferulic acid in a dose-dependent manner. To conclude, ferulic acid enhances antioxidants and decreases NF-κB, thereby protecting the cells against stress induced by glycerol. © 2014 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

abstract={Objectives: Proinflammatory cytokines and the oxidative stress response are reported to be involved in dengue viral disease. The present study investigated the correlation of proinflammatory cytokines and lipid peroxidation with dengue severity. Methods: Clinical samples from 27 dengue fever (DF) cases, 30 dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) cases, and 24 dengue shock syndrome (DSS) cases were studied around defervescence, along with samples from 30 healthy controls. Plasma samples were analysed for tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) by ELISA and for malondialdehyde (MDA) by thiobarbituric acid assay. Results: Dengue-infected individuals had significantly higher levels of TNF-α, IFN-γ, and MDA in comparison to controls. The ratio of TNF-α to IFN-γ was significantly higher in DHF and DSS than in DF. A TNF-α/IFN-γ ratio value of 5.69 around defervescence predicted DHF and DSS with moderate accuracy and thus may serve as an indicator to study dengue severity. The study observed a significant positive correlation of lipid peroxides with TNF-α levels and the TNF-α/IFN-γ ratio in severe dengue cases. Conclusions: We propose that the oxidative stress response induced by the dengue virus may trigger the inflammatory cytokine responses in dengue severity and thereby contributes to the pathogenesis of the disease; however the interplay between the oxidative response and inflammatory activity in disease virulence needs further study. © 2013 The Authors.},

abstract={We experimentally demonstrate the effect of dynamic environment coupling in a system of coupled piecewise linear time-delay electronic circuits with mutual and subsystem coupling configurations. Time-delay systems are essentially infinite-dimensional systems with complex phase-space properties. Dynamic environmental coupling with mutual coupling configuration has been recently theoretically shown to induce complete (CS) and inverse synchronizations (IS) [Resmi et al., 2010] in low-dimensional dynamical systems described by ordinary differential equations (ODEs), for which no experimental confirmation exists. In this paper, we investigate the effect of dynamic environment for the first time in mutual as well as subsystem coupling configurations in coupled time-delay differential equations theoretically and experimentally. Depending upon the coupling strength and the nature of feedback, we observe a transition from asynchronization to CS via phase synchronization and from asynchronization to IS via inverse-phase synchronization in both coupling configurations. The results are corroborated by snapshots of the time evolution, phase projection plots and localized sets as observed from the oscilloscope. Further, the synchronization is also confirmed numerically from the largest Lyapunov exponents, correlation of probability of recurrence and correlation coefficient of the coupled time-delay system. We also present a linear stability analysis and obtain conditions for different synchronized states. © 2014 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={Nuclear orphan receptor TLX (Drosophila tailless homolog) is essential for the maintenance of neural stem/progenitor cell self-renewal, but its role in neuroblastoma (NB) is not well understood. Here, we show that TLX is essential for the formation of tumor spheres in three different NB cell lines, when grown in neural stem cell media. We demonstrate that the knock down of TLX in IMR-32 cells diminishes its tumor sphere-forming capacity. In tumor spheres, TLX is coexpressed with the neural progenitor markers Nestin, CD133 and Oct-4. In addition, TLX is coexpressed with the migratory neural progenitor markers CD15 and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) in xenografts of primary NB cells from patients. Subsequently, we show the effect of TLX on the proliferative, invasive and migratory properties of IMR-32 cells. We attribute this to the recruitment of TLX to both MMP-2 and Oct-4 gene promoters, which resulted in the respective gene activation. In support of our findings, we found that TLX expression was high in NB patient tissues when compared with normal peripheral nervous system tissues. Further, the Kaplan-Meier estimator indicated a negative correlation between TLX expression and survival in 88 NB patients. Therefore, our results point at TLX being a crucial player in progression of NB, by promoting self-renewal of NB tumor-initiating cells and altering their migratory and invasive properties. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract={Fabrication of three dimensional (3D) organoids with controlled microarchitectures has been shown to enhance tissue functionality. Bioprinting can be used to precisely position cells and cell-laden materials to generate controlled tissue architecture. Therefore, it represents an exciting alternative for organ fabrication. Despite the rapid progress in the field, the development of printing processes that can be used to fabricate macroscale tissue constructs from ECM-derived hydrogels has remained a challenge. Here we report a strategy for bioprinting of photolabile cell-laden methacrylated gelatin (GelMA) hydrogels. We bioprinted cell-laden GelMA at concentrations ranging from 7 to 15% with varying cell densities and found a direct correlation between printability and the hydrogel mechanical properties. Furthermore, encapsulated HepG2 cells preserved cell viability for at least eight days following the bioprinting process. In summary, this work presents a strategy for direct-write bioprinting of a cell-laden photolabile ECM-derived hydrogel, which may find widespread application for tissue engineering, organ printing and the development of 3D drug discovery platforms. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.},
