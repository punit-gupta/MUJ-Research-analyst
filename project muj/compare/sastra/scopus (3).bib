abstract={Temporal control over self-assembly process is a desirable trait in the quest towards adaptable and controllable materials. The ability to devise synthetic ways to control the growth, as well as decay of materials has long been a property which only the biological systems could perform seamlessly. A common synthetic strategy which works on the biological principles such as chemical fuel-driven control over temporal self-assembly profile has not been completely realized synthetically. Here we show, we filled this dearth by showing that a chemical fuel driven self-assembling system can not only be grown in a controlled manner, but it can also result in precise control over the assembly and disassembly kinetics. Herein, we elaborate strategies which clearly show that once a chemical fuel driven self-assembly is established it can be made receptive to multiple molecular cues such that the inherent growth and decay characteristics are programmed into the ensemble. © 2019, The Author(s).},

abstract={Colistin resistance in Enterobacteriaceae especially Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli is driving the evolution of pan drug resistant strains. Screening a library of 13 plant nutraceuticals led to the identification of acetyl shikonin and ursolic acid, which exhibited synergy with colistin against extremely drug resistant (XDR) clinical strains of E. coli (U3790) and K. pneumoniae (BC936). Ursolic acid caused a significant colistin MIC reversal of 16-fold in U3790 and 4-fold in BC936 strains. Ursolic acid also potentiated the bactericidal effect of colistin against both U3790 and BC936 by causing ~ 4 to 4.5 log fold decline in CFU of both clinical isolates in a time kill assay. At 2× minimum effective concentration, ursolic acid was non-toxic to zebrafish as evidenced by brain and liver enzyme profiles and by histopathology studies. In combination with colistin, ursolic acid reduced bacterial bioburden of U3790/BC936 by 1–1.58 log fold from the infected muscle tissue of zebrafish. Mechanistic explorations via studies on real time efflux, membrane potential and intracellular accumulation of dansyl chloride tagged colistin revealed that colistin efflux is inhibited by ursolic acid. In addition, ursolic acid also enhanced outer membrane permeability which probably facilitates colistin’s attack on outer and inner membranes. Our study shows that ursolic acid synergizes with colistin by inhibiting colistin efflux in Enterobacteriaceae that helps to curtail colistin resistant Enterobacteriaceae. © 2019, The Author(s).},

abstract={Domain swapping is the process by which identical monomeric proteins exchange structural elements to generate dimers/oligomers. Although engineered domain swapping is a compelling strategy for protein assembly, its application has been limited due to the lack of simple and reliable design approaches. Here, we demonstrate that the hydrophobic five-residue ‘cystatin motif’ (QVVAG) from the domain-swapping protein Stefin B, when engineered into a solvent-exposed, tight surface loop between two β-strands prevents the loop from folding back upon itself, and drives domain swapping in non-domain-swapping proteins. High-resolution structural studies demonstrate that engineering the QVVAG stretch independently into various surface loops of four structurally distinct non-domain-swapping proteins enabled the design of different modes of domain swapping in these proteins, including single, double and open-ended domain swapping. These results suggest that the introduction of the QVVAG motif can be used as a mutational approach for engineering domain swapping in diverse β-hairpin proteins. © 2019, The Author(s).},

abstract={This report unravels frustration as a source of transient chaotic dynamics even in a simple array of coupled limit cycle oscillators. The transient chaotic dynamics along with the multistable nature of frustrated systems facilitates the existence of complex basin structures such as fractal and riddled basins. In particular, we report the emergence of transient chaotic dynamics around the chaotic itinerancy region, where the basin of attraction near the chaotic region is riddled and it becomes fractal basin when we move away from this region. Normally the complex basin structures are observed only for oscillatory states but surprisingly it is also observed even for oscillation death states. Interestingly super persistent transient chaos is also shown to emerge in the coupled limit cycle oscillators, which manifests as a stable chaos for larger networks. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={We report experimental investigations carried out on a new minichannel heat sink (nMCHS) comprising four compartments, each equipped with inlet and outlet plenums for coolant and rectangular minichannels with two miter bends in each channel. For comparison, the performance of a conventional minichannel heat sink (cMCHS) comprising minichannels of same hydraulic diameter as that of the channels in new heat sink was also studied. Reynolds number had a stronger influence on Nusselt number in nMCHS than that in conventional. The experimental data (Reynolds number range from 175.02 to 553.40; pumping power range from 4.47E-3 to 1.89E-1 W) reveals that the total thermal resistance was appreciably reduced in the new heat sink, due to higher heat transfer coefficients caused by developing nature of the flow. The coolant distribution in the new minichannel heat sink contributed to a significant reduction (60%) in substrate temperature gradient. © 2019},

The significant parameters necessary to validate the electronic and stable nature of As-arm nanoribbon are computed with the help of formation energy and energy gap change. The density of states (DOS) spectrum and the energy band structure are figured-out for both isolated and asphyxiants adsorbed As-arm nanoribbon, which affirms the transfer of electrons taking place between As-arm nanoribbon and the asphyxiants. Also, surface assimilating properties like Bader charge transfer, average energy gap variation, and adsorption energy are calculated for the asphyxiants adsorbed As-arm nanoribbon. Moreover, the comparison is made between the electron density of isolated and asphyxiants adsorbed As-arm nanoribbon to enunciate the utilization of As-arm nanoribbon as a chemisensor for detecting the asphyxiants HCN and NCCl molecules. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={In this work presents the interaction of mixed convection and surface radiation heat transfer studies on thermally developing laminar airflow in a differentially heated horizontal channel with isothermal vertical walls and adiabatic top and bottom walls. The side heated isothermal wall incorporated a heater, and the opposite wall acts as a constant temperature heat source. The major thermal and geometric parameter includes variable wall temperatures, wall surface emissivity, Reynolds number, heat flux and air chosen as the working medium. Due to the wall surface emissivity of the channel, the internal wall surface radiation will significantly change the rate of total heat transfer inside the channel. Therefore, the current research focuses on the mixed convective and surface radiation heat transfer process happening in laminar flow over a horizontal channel. Radiative heat transfer is determined with the help of experimental results and the use of the numerical scheme. The results presented here show the rate of convection heat transfer and the distribution of surface temperature along the walls inside the channel. The flow configuration the channel inside is pictured by passing smoke at the bottom of the entrance section. The quantitative and qualitative results showed that the emissivity of walls and other thermal and geometric parameters significantly affected the overall heat transfer improvement from the square channel. © 2019},

abstract={This paper discusses two different problems. The first is the classic system of the Euler equations for the rotation of a rigid body about a fixed point. We study the Euler system using singularity analysis for the zero torque and nonzero torque cases. Secondly, we implement an alternate approach to study a system consisting of three or more first-order odes. An existing dependent variable is considered to be independent and the old or original system is rewritten as a new system with a fewer number of first-order odes. We study the analysis of the new system using the Lie symmetry approach. The main reason behind following this approach is to overcome the tedious calculation of the Lie point symmetries for the original system. The method is explained using the Ramanujan system, which arises in modular theory, for which we introduce a new independent variable to reduce the system to two first-order equations, from which we obtain a single second-order equation with one Lie-Point symmetry. The reduced equation is an Abel's equation of the first kind which is the same result as can be obtained by the usual procedure. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

The MBE approach is based on multiple views of the systems with each domain model describing a particular view. The multi-view modelling approach is used to perform design and verification of the IIoT enabled control in process industries. We show that such an integration of MBE, cloud-computing, and IIoT provides certain desirable features such as plug-and-play control and on-the fly verification which are lacking in the process industry.

abstract={A thorough examination of weak interactions present in the crystal structure of the title compound was investigated. Intramolecular C–H⋯N and F⋯S interactions make the molecule as fused 6,5,5,5,6,6-membered ring system. Two of the closely related structures show 1D-isostructurality with the title compound. The crystal structure is stabilized by different types of weak intermolecular C–H⋯N, C–H⋯F, C–H···π and S···π and π···π interactions. The first two strongest dimers are stabilized by stacking interactions. The nature of these interactions and their role was established through quantum theory of atoms-in-molecules approach.

abstract={Using first-principles calculations, electronic characteristics and geometrical stability of pure and Sn substituted armchair β – antimonene nanotube (SbNT) is explored. The adsorption behavior of phosgene (COCl 2 ) on SbNT is studied using ab initio method. Also, the effect of base material sensitivity with the influence of substitution of Sn dopant is studied. The SbNT energy band structure gets altered upon exposure to the COCl 2 gas molecules. The density-of-states (DOS) spectrum gives the precision on the transfer of charge during the interaction of COCl 2 gas on SbNT material. Moreover, the phosgene molecules interaction on SbNT results in the variation of adsorption energy around −0.578 to −1.364 eV. Further, the average band gap changes are detected in the range of 1.75–19.3% for pristine SbNT, and 192.31–369.23% for Sn substituted SbNT material. The findings suggest that the physisorption of phosgene gas on Sn substituted SbNT is found to be more significant when compared to pristine SbNT. The current work shows that Sn substituted SbNT as a good base material to probe phosgene gas molecules. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Acute lung injury (ALI) and its severe form acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients, and no specific therapies are still available to control the mortality rate. Thus, we explored the preventive and therapeutic effects of tannic acid (TA), a natural polyphenol in the context of ALI. We used in vivo and in vitro models, respectively, using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce ALI in mice and exposing J774 and BEAS-2B cells to LPS. In both preventive and therapeutic approaches, TA attenuated LPS-induced histopathological alterations, lipid peroxidation, lung permeability, infiltration of inflammatory cells, and the expression of proinflammatory mediators. In addition, in-vitro study showed that TA treatment could reduce the expression of proinflammatory mediators. Further studies revealed that TA-dampened inflammatory responses by downregulating the LPS-induced toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expression and inhibiting extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation. Furthermore, cells treated with the inhibitors of ERK1/2 (PD98059) and p38 (SB203580) mitigated the expression of cytokines induced by LPS, thus suggesting that ERK1/2 and p38 activity are required for the inflammatory response. In conclusion, TA could attenuate LPS-induced inflammation and may be a potential therapeutic agent for ALI-associated inflammation in clinical settings. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={An accurate diagnosis of Parkinson's disease by specialists involves many neurological, psychological and physical examinations. The specialists investigate a number of symptoms and signs when examining the nervous system conditions of a person. The diagnosis involves reviewing the medical history and genetic factor of the person. The recent diagnosis methodology to Parkinson's disease relies on voice disorders analysis. This methodology entails extracting feature sets of a recorded person's voice then utilizing a machine learning technique to identify the healthy and Parkinson's cases from the voice. This paper attempts to improve the diagnoses of Parkinson's disease by testing multiple feature evaluation and classification machine learning methods based on the voice disorders analysis. The aim of this paper is to find the optimal solution to the problem by (i) proposing a new Multiple Feature Evaluation Approach (MFEA) of a multi-agent system (ii) implementing five independent classification schemas which are Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes, Neural Network, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machine on the Parkinson's diagnosis before and after applying the MFEA, and (iii) evaluating the diagnosis accuracy of the results. The methodology of the tests encompasses 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate the learning of methods and track variation in their performance. The test results show that the MFEA of the multi-agent system finds the best set of features and improves the performance of the classifiers. The average rate of improvement in the diagnostic accuracy of the classifiers are Decision Tree 10.51%, Naïve Bayes 15.22%, Neural Network 9.19%, Random Forests 12.75%, and Support Vector Machine 9.13%. These results show that the MFEA makes a significant improvement to the classifiers’ diagnosis results. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Cerebral ischemia is a deadly condition that arises due to blockage of the blood vessels in the brain leading to oxygen deficiency thereby arresting brain functions and resulting in death or permanent impairment. Though a myriad of factors has been proposed to cause cerebral ischemia, it has been generally regarded as an old age-associated malady. However, unhealthy diet, stressful lifestyle and deteriorating environment quality has dramatically reduced the age on onset as well as the number of victims in recent years. Hence, there exists a need for prompt and effective therapeutic strategies for immediate as well as long-term damage control and maintenance of the functions of the brain, as well as early and accurate diagnosis of the risk of stroke or extent of damage after stroke. The physiological barriers further complicate the development of therapeutic and diagnostic interventions for cerebral stroke. The advent of nanotechnology has initiated new vistas for more effective and superior therapeutic and imaging modalities for management of cerebral ischemia. This review provides an overview on the current knowledge on the mechanism and causative factors of cerebral ischemia, drawbacks of conventional therapy as well as molecular targets that are being explored for stroke therapy. The review also discusses in detail the advances made using nano-interventions for therapy and imaging of stroke-affected regions along with their pros and cons. Emergent multi-functional nanoparticles for stroke management have also been reviewed. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The interactions between the surfactants and the precursors play significant roles in tuning the textural properties of mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride (MGCN), whereas the degree of polycondensation of the precursors is influenced by the nature of the surfactant employed, which in turn affect the C/N ratio and surface functionalities of MGCN. Herein, we report the effect of surfactants, namely; cationic (cetyl trimethylammonium bromide, CTAB), neutral (polyethylene glycol p-(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)-phenyl ether, Triton X-100) and anionic (sodium dodecyl sulfate, SDS) on the C/N ratio, functionalities, textural properties and the capacitance performance of MGCN. The formation of MGCN with different textural properties is confirmed by the microscopic and sorption studies. The variation in the C/N ratio and surface functionalities of the MGCN samples are investigated by elemental analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic studies. Among all MGCN samples, the highest specific capacitance of 279 F g −1 at a current density of 0.5 A g −1 is obtained for MGCN synthesized using Triton X-100 (MGCN-T). It also exhibits better rate performance than the other two samples. This superior capacitance performance of MGCN-T is attributed to higher surface area, more number of mesopores, larger pore volume, higher number of graphitic carbon domains and surface functionalities. A symmetrical supercapacitor device fabricated using MGCN-T delivers energy density of 20.97 Wh kg −1 at a power density of 499.94 W kg −1 , which is higher than the values reported for various nitrogen-doped carbonaceous materials. Further, the device exhibits stable cycling over 10,000 cycles. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Rapid growth in urban population creates various kinds of issues like long hours traffic-jams, pollution which makes the city life insecure and non-liveable. The concept of a smart city is introduced to improve the quality of city life. Smart cities are being developed to satisfy the need for the safety of its users’ and secure journeys over in the urban scenario by proposing the smart mobility concept. At the same time, Vehicular adhoc network (VANET) comes under the type of mobile adhoc network (MANET), wherever the vehicles are treated as nodes in a network. The application of Big Data technologies to VANET gains useful insight from the massive quantity of operational data to enhance traffic management process like planning, engineering as well as operation. During the real-time processes, the VANET generates large data, and the VANET characteristics are mapped to Big Data attributes. Moreover, ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm is employed for routing in vehicular networks over Hadoop Map Reduce standalone distributed framework and over multi-node cluster with 2, 3, 4 and 5 nodes.

abstract={Laser boriding technique was used to form boride layers on EN25 steel. The main aim of this current study is to form the hard laser borided layer on the low alloy steel surface and analyze the effect of process parameters on borided layer hardness, depth, and width. The properties and microstructure (micro-hardness, boride layer width, and depth) are analyzed after laser boriding process with different laser process parameters (power and speed). The micro-hardness of the boride layer was measured using the Vickers micro-hardness tester. The boride depth and width was measured and captured using a machine vision inspection system. The existence of borides formed in the laser treated layer was confirmed via X-ray diffraction technique. The corrosion rates of the laser borided and as received samples are observed in 3% NaCl solution using Potentiodynamic polarization test. The response surface methodology was used to analyze the effects of power, travel speed on the hardness and the boron layer width and depth. The two-factor three-level full factorial design available in response surface methodology was used to develop the regression model for laser boriding process. A multiobjective optimization technique was used to optimize the laser process parameters to maximize the boron layer width and to minimize the boride layer depth.

abstract={The latest research data indicates that geopolymer concrete reinforced with mono fibre has a remarkable enhancement in its impact strength and fracture toughness, which is well documented. Nevertheless, many aspects of impact behaviour of Hybrid Fibrous Geopolymer Composites (HFGC) are still unexplored, which are of primary importance for defense projects in the world. For the first time, the impact behaviour under falling weight collision of HFGC were evaluated and further analysed. The HFGC mixtures were fabricated using three different fibres viz., 5D hooked end steel, polypropylene and glass. The main parameters studied were the fibre dosage and amalgamations of different fibres. Totally seven mixes were prepared and further investigations were conducted in two phases. In the first phase, five cylindrical specimens were fabricated for each mix and tested as per the ACI committee 544 falling weight collision test recommendations. Subsequently, a comprehensive two-parameter Weibull distribution was executed to scrutinise the scattered experimental test results of cylindrical specimens and presented in terms of reliability function. In the second phase, prism specimens were fabricated and tested under the same falling weight collision. Then, an analytical model was formulated for evaluating the impact energy at failure of HFGC prism specimens and comparisons were made with experimental data. The hybridisation of the above three fibres at a certain dosage and incorporation in geopolymer composites led to an enhanced impact performance and ductility properties. Further, the obtained impact energy at failure from modelling well agrees with the experimental results. Henceforth, it is a successful research data that is presented herein which will be eminently valuable for understanding the performance of new fibrous geopolymer composites (FGC) made with hybrid fibres that which are available all over the world. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={An easily accessible chemo-probe based on physical mixture of 2,4-dimethylpyrrole and 4-nitrobenzaldehyde has been developed. Based on NMR spectroscopic analysis, catalyst free formation of dipyrromethane was observed in the physical mixture of chemo-probe. The probe is utilized in effective colorimetric sensing of copper(II) ions present in environmental solutions by instantaneous appearance of red colour, even in the co-existence of various metal ions. The lowest detection limit of 2.51 μM for this chemo-probe towards copper(II) sensing is significantly lower than the WHO prescribed level (<30 μM of copper(II) ions) in potable water.

The effect of a donor (positive) and acceptor (negative) trap charges with various concentrations on the device d.c characteristics are studied. A comparative analysis has been performed between symmetric silicon dual gate tunnel field effect transistor (DG-TFET) and ADMDG-TFET (both Si and Si 0.3 Ge 0.7 ) with matching dimensions in the presence/absence of interface trap charges. It is found that a shift in threshold voltage (V th ) and subthreshold swing (SS) degradation are observed due to the presence of interface traps in both devices. However, the ADMDG TFET is more immune to V th shift and SS degradation by acceptor and donor interface traps compared to silicon DG TFET. Also, the ambipolar current in ADMDG TFET is more suppressed than the silicon DG TFET in the presence of trap charges. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH},

abstract={Linalool is the active constituent of essential oils of several plant species like coriander, rosewood and cinnamon, which is known to have strong antibacterial activity. However, its application in food systems is limited because of low water solubility, high volatility and low stability. The present study was undertaken to overcome such problems by encapsulating the linalool into nanoemulsions using Tween 80 and water using ultrasonic assisted emulsification. The stable nanoemulsions with a mean droplet diameter of 10.9 ± 0.1 nm was obtained at a 1:3 (v/v) ratio of linalool and Tween 80. The antibacterial and antibiofilm activities of the stable nanoemulsions were further investigated. The linalool nanoemulsions showed twofold enhanced antibacterial activity against Salmonella Typhimurium through their increased ability to disrupt cell membrane integrity. Moreover, compared to the pure linalool, the linalool nanoemulsions showed an 11.5% higher antibiofilm activity. Nanoemulsions also effectively reduced the S. Typhimurium biofilm on the surface of cut pineapple. Sensory analysis showed acceptance of fresh cut pineapple with linalool nanoemulsions treatment. Therefore, results of the present study indicated the potential use of linalool nanoemulsions as a natural antibacterial and antibiofilm agent against S. Typhimurium, which could find applications in the food industry. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The steady supply of quality power from the distribution system is a major concern for the sensitive loads. The dynamic voltage restorer system is mainly used to compensate voltage sags and swells for uninterrupted reliable &quality power supply. Hence, this work proposes a novel combination of dynamic voltage restorer and compressed air energy storage for power quality enhancement. The main aim of this work is to replace the conventional battery powered dynamic voltage restorers with the compressed air energy storage powered dynamic voltage restorers. This article presents the design and modeling of a third generation compressed air energy storage system with zero greenhouse gas emission and high response time. Further, a compressed air energy storage powered dynamic voltage restorer (CAESPDVR) connected distribution system supplying a sensitive load is modeled and the voltage variations during various faults are analyzed. The behavior of the system with and without the compressed air energy storage powered dynamic voltage restorer is investigated.

The proposed BBC is analyzed, modeled and designed for the rated load. Generally, the utilization of Multiple Output SMPS (MOSMPS) for PC application introduces Power Quality (PQ) issues in the power system network. Unlike conventional SMPS the proposed NN controlled BBC can accomplish improvement of power quality. The NN controller reduces the Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) of source current below 5%, maintains input side Power Factor (PF) to be nearly unity and improves the output voltage regulation. In the proposed system, NN controller replaces the conventional PI controller and overcomes the drawbacks of the conventional system. The proposed BBC is validated adopting MATLAB/SIMULINK software. The simulation analysis validate that the proposed NN controlled BBC performs better than conventional converter in terms of PQ indices under fluctuating conditions.

abstract={Assessment of the pre- and post-development impacts of a watershed predisposed to erosion is an important step in planning sustainable development strategies. Erosion susceptibility of a small mountain watershed, Palar in the Western Ghats, is assessed by employing a weighted linear combination (WLC) model combined with terrain attributes. The WLC model shows that relative relief, slope, curvature, and the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) significantly affect the susceptibility of the watershed to erosion, whereas the wetness index, stream power index, and drainage density have minimal effect. A comparison of the WLC model with the empirical revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) model shows that zones prone to severe erosion remain the same, whereas zones prone to moderate and low erosion are significantly different. In the WLC-based erosion susceptibility model, zones prone to moderate erosion dominate the spatial distribution, whereas in the RUSLE model the low-erosion category dominates. The results of our study can be applied to natural hazards management, land development impacts, land degradation, and spatial modelling where terrain features are influential. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

Method: 102 patients with cancer pain are selected from a municipal people's hospital from 2014 to 2016 in China. Based on the Bayesian algorithm of geometric reconstruction, the variety, dosage, prescription number, specification and frequency of anesthetic analgesic drugs used by patients are analyzed comprehensively. Results: the anesthetic analgesic drugs used by 102 patients with cancer pain mainly include Morphine Hydrochloride Injection, Tramadol Injection, Dezocine Injection, Morphine Hydrochloride Sustained-release Tablets, Tramadol Hydrochloride Sustained-release Tablets, Oxycodone Hydrochloride Sustained-release Tablets and Fentanyl Transparent Dressing. Among them, the dosage of Morphine Hydrochloride Sustained-release Tablets is the highest, followed by Tramadol Hydrochloride Sustained-release Tablets, Oxycodone Hydrochloride Sustained-release Tablets, Fentanyl Transparent Dressing, Morphine Hydrochloride Injection, Tramadol Injection and Dezocine Injection. The drug use frequency of Fentanyl Transparent Dressing is the highest and the lowest is Dezocine Injection. The drug utilization index of Oxycodone Hydrochloride Sustained-release Tablets is the lowest, and that of Morphine Hydrochloride Sustained-release Tablets is the highest. Conclusion: The use principle of anesthetic analgesic drugs for cancer patient with pain basically conforms to the three-step analgesic principle of cancer pain, and the dosages and specifications of anesthetic drugs are basically reasonable, but need to be further standardized and rationalized. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Rationale: Our recent study suggested that ischemia–reperfusion (I/R) induced oxidative stress was minimal in the rat heart during initial stage of diabetes and the one that progressed to diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM), despite having higher infarct and low cardiac performance. Mitochondrial dysfunction is an important mediator for adverse outcome in rat heart affected with diabetes, which is also a potential contributor for the cardiac reperfusion injury. Objective: The current study aims to evaluate the susceptibility of diabetes heart with or without myopathy to I/R injury and its influence on cardiac mitochondrial function. Methods and Results: Male Wistar rats (3 weeks old) were fed with high-fat diet for 8 weeks followed by diabetes mellitus (DM) induction via streptozotocin (35 mg/kg body weight) and maintained for further 4 weeks. The animal displayed cardiomyopathy characteristics like hypertrophy, fibrosis, and insulin resistance-termed diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). To study the specific effect of DCM on I/R, we included diabetic rats without cardiomyopathy. Induction of I/R in different groups suggested higher vulnerability to injury in DCM rat hearts than DM and normal (measured via hemodynamics, triphenyltetrazolium chloride stain, and apoptotic markers). Mitochondrial function at the subpopulation level was evaluated with respect to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentration, membrane potential, swelling behavior, and oxidative stress, wherein the results confirmed I/R-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Unlike normal heart, DM, and DCM heart challenged to I/R exhibited altered ATP producing capacity among subsarcolemmal and interfibrillar mitochondria. Conclusion: The above results suggest that mitochondrial changes associated with diabetes and cardiomyopathy significantly contribute to the adverse outcome of I/R injury. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Nanofluids have shown significant promise in the thermal enhancement of many industrial systems. They have been developed extensively in energy applications in recent years. Solar energy systems are one of the most promising renewables available to humanity and these are increasingly being re-designed to benefit from nanofluids. Most designs of solar collectors involve fixed (rigid) geometries which may be cylindrical, parabolic, tubular or flat-plate types. Modern developments in biomimetics have identified that deformable conduit structures may be beneficial for sustainable energy systems. Motivated by these aspects, in the current work we present a novel model for simulating a biomimetic peristaltic solar magnetohydrodynamic nanofluid-based pump. The working fluid is a magnetized nanofluid which comprises a base fluid containing suspended magnetic nano-particles. The novelty of the present work is the amalgamation of biomimetics (peristaltic propulsion), magnetohydrodynamics and nanofluid dynamics to produce a hybrid solar pump system model. Heat is transferred via distensibility of the conduit in the form of peristaltic thermal waves and buoyancy effects. An externally applied magnetic field achieves the necessary circuit design for generating Lorentzian magnetic body force in the fluid. A variable viscosity modification of the Buongiorno nanofluid model is employed which features thermophoretic body force and Brownian dynamic effects. To simulate solar loading conditions a thermal radiative flux model is also deployed. An asymmetric porous channel is investigated with multiple amplitudes and phases for the wall wavy motion. The channel also contains a homogenous, isotropic porous medium which is simulated with a modified Darcy model. Heat generation/absorption effects are also examined. The electrically-conducting nature of the nanofluid invokes magnetohydrodynamic effects. The moving boundary value problem is normalized and linearized using the lubrication approach. Analytical solutions are derived for axial velocity, temperature and nanoparticle volume fraction. Validation is conducted with Maple numerical quadrature. Furthermore, the salient features of pumping and trapping phenomena discourse briefly. The observations demonstrate promising features of the solar magnetohydrodynamic peristaltic nanofluid pump which may also be exploited in spacecraft applications, biological smart drug delivery etc. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={To assess the cellular stress evoked by exposure of Brilliant Blue-G (BBG), adult retinal pigment epithelial (ARPE-19) cells were treated with various dilutions of BBG in balanced salt solution plus (BSS-PLUS) with and without endoillumination (Alcon Constellation Vision System). The treatments lasted for acute periods of 2 and 5 min. MTT and presto blue assays were performed to assess the changes in cell viability; reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was quantified by DCFDA (dichlorofluorescin diacetate) assay, and the expression of inflammatory stress and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) genes were quantified by qPCR. We observed no reduction in cell viability at 2 min of dye treatment with and without endoillumination while at 5 min exposure, a reduction in cell viability at all concentrations of the dye was observed compared to control. Though there was an increase in ROS with endoillumination, it was insignificant. There was no change in the mRNA expression of TNF-α while that of GRP78, and inflammatory genes viz. IL-8, IL-1β showed a significant increase at 0.5 mg/ml dye with endoillumination. BBG reduced cell viability with increasing concentration and time. The undiluted concentration of the dye results in inflammatory stress compared to the diluted formulations. Interestingly, increased GRP78 at undiluted concentration indicates a protective response in cells exposed to light. However, further studies are needed to evaluate the effect of cellular stress on the visual outcome. We infer that the commercially available formulation of BBG is safe for the RPE, at the recommended dose for a short duration however its toxicity to other cell types need to be addressed. © 2019},

abstract={Seed-mediated Gold-Iron oxide yolk-shell nanoparticles (YSNPs) were synthesized and functionalized with cy5 attached- thiolated single strand DNA probe for the detection of mutated DNA. The optimum concentration of thiolated DNA determined from a bathochromic shift of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peak, was 0.177μM. The effect of pH (2–10), temperature (4, 37, 60 and 100 °C), and ionic strengths (1 M to 4 M) on the stability of ssDNA probe tethered YSNPs, studied with the assistance of flocculation parameter. The detection of mutation in DNA was possible using such ssDNA probe functionalized and stabilized nanoparticles. The hybridization of the oligonucleotide probe with the complementary, non-complementary and mutated DNA strands are determined via their respective intensities of the fluorescence of cy5, an efficient fluorescent marker. The intensities help in the comprehension of the specificity of the system. The report predicts controlled efficiency of hybridization with the aid of Hamaker constant, which is determined as 1.15 × 10 −20 J for DNA functionalized YSNPs.

abstract={Magnetic nanoparticles occupy a significant class of inorganic nanoparticles with its very promising application in biosensors and bio-imaging. Physical and chemical methods have been used conventionally to prepare magnetic nanoparticles. However, these methods have its own limitations, which redirected recent research towards safe, clean and eco-friendly green synthesis approach. In our study, green magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (FeNP DG) were prepared by using aqueous Desmodium gangeticum root extract as a reducing as well as a capping agent. Nanoparticles used in different biological milieu has to be explored for their toxicity before its application. Thus prepared nanoparticles were evaluated for its nephrotoxicity in Wistar rats (100 mg/kg b.wt), in renal epithelial cells, LLC PK1 (1 mg/ml) and isolated mitochondria (0.25, 0.5, 1 mg/ml) and compared it with the conventionally prepared iron oxide nanoparticles (FeNP Chem). Our study demonstrate that chemically prepared FeNPs are toxic to kidney and its epithelial cells.On the other hand, when the same nanoparticles were prepared by green route (FeNP DG) exhibited minimum toxicity measured via the renal markers in blood and urine along with cytotoxicity assay in LLC PK1 cells. But at mitochondrial level, both FeNP Chem and FeNP DG were found to be toxic to the organelle. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={A simple single-stage method, based on refluxing edible carrot with aqueous trisodium phosphate (TSP) has been reported to synthesize blue color luminescent carbon dots (CDs). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image showed that CDs are almost spherical in shape and the size is around 3–8 nm. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) and 1 H NMR spectroscopy study revealed that the carbohydrates present in the carrot undergone carbonization to produce luminescent CDs. Optimization study indicate that refluxing 5 g of carrot in 80 mM TSP aqueous solution for 120 min is adequate to produce highly luminescent blue CDs. The CDs produced are used as luminophore to image bacteria through fluorescence microscopy. CDs have membrane good permeability and minimum toxicity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. The CDs capability for direct reduction of silver ions to elemental silver (Ag 0 ) and gold ions to elemental gold (Au 0 ) without additional reducing and stabilizing agent was demonstrated. The resulting Ag and Au nanoparticles have a size of 8–22 nm and 5–15 nm, respectively. The catalytic activity of nanoparticles in the hydrogenation reaction was investigated. The results suggest that the nanoparticles had high catalytic activity in the sodium borohydride mediated hydrogenation of nitroaromatic compounds. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Malnutrition, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), refers to deficiencies, excesses, or imbalances in a person’s intake of energy and/or nutrients. It is well-known that maternal, infant, and child nutrition play significant roles in the proper growth and development, including future socio-economic status of the child. Reports of National Health & Family Survey, United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund, and WHO have highlighted that rates of malnutrition among adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating women, and children are alarmingly high in India. Factors responsible for malnutrition in the country include mother’s nutritional status, lactation behaviour, women’s education, and sanitation. These affect children in several ways including stunting, childhood illness, and retarded growth. Although India has nominally reduced malnutrition over the last decade, and several government programs are in place, there remains a need for effective use of knowledge gained through studies to address undernutrition, especially because it impedes the socio-economic development of the country. These findings may provide useful lessons for other developing countries that are working towards reducing child malnutrition in their settings. © 2018, Springer Nature Limited.},

abstract={Ventilation systems are critically important components of many public buildings and workspaces. Proper ventilation is often crucial for preventing accidents, such as explosions in mines and avoiding health issues, for example, through long-term exposure to harmful respirable matter. Validation and maintenance of ventilation systems is thus of key interest for plant operators and authorities. However, methods for ventilation characterization, which allow us to monitor whether the ventilation system in place works as desired, hardly exist. This article addresses the critical challenge of ventilation characterization-measuring and modelling air flow at micro-scales-that is, creating a high-resolution model of wind speed and direction from airflow measurements. Models of the near-surface micro-scale flow fields are not only useful for ventilation characterization, but they also provide critical information for planning energy-efficient paths for aerial robots and many applications in mobile robot olfaction. In this article we propose a heterogeneous measurement system composed of static, continuously sampling sensing nodes, complemented by localized measurements, collected during occasional sensing missions with a mobile robot. We introduce a novel, data-driven, multi-domain airflow modelling algorithm that estimates (1) fields of posterior distributions over wind direction and speed ("ventilation maps", spatial domain); (2) sets of ventilation calendars that capture the evolution of important airflow characteristics at measurement positions (temporal domain); and (3) a frequency domain analysis that can reveal periodic changes of airflow in the environment. The ventilation map and the ventilation calendars make use of an improved estimation pipeline that incorporates a wind sensor model and a transition model to better filter out sporadic, noisy airflow changes. These sudden changes may originate from turbulence or irregular activity in the surveyed environment and can, therefore, disturb modelling of the relevant airflow patterns. We tested the proposed multi-domain airflow modelling approach with simulated data and with experiments in a semi-controlled environment and present results that verify the accuracy of our approach and its sensitivity to different turbulence levels and other disturbances. Finally, we deployed the proposed system in two different real-world industrial environments (foundry halls) with different ventilation regimes for three weeks during full operation. Since airflow ground truth cannot be obtained, we present a qualitative discussion of the generated airflow models with plant operators, who concluded that the computed models accurately depicted the expected airflow patterns and are useful to understand how pollutants spread in the work environment. This analysis may then provide the basis for decisions about corrective actions to avoid long-term exposure of workers to harmful respirable matter.},

abstract={Evidence suggests that hydrogen sulfide precondition (HIPC) is an effective protocol in the management of ischemia reperfusion (I/R) by attenuating free radical and calcium overload in mitochondria. However the efficacy of HIPC is largely unknown in diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) hearts subjected to I/R procedure. Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups: i) normal, ii) diabetes mellitus (DM), and iii) diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). DM and DCM animals were prepared by using streptozotocin injection at the age of 4 week (35 mg/kg, i.p). DCM animals were additionally administered with high fat diet for 3 months. Isolated rat hearts were perfused by using Langendorff apparatus with continuous hemodynamic monitoring. Following reperfusion, cardiac physiological efficiency was highly compromised in DCM heart (high infarct size by 94% and low relative pressure product by 65%) as compared to normal rat heart. HIPC effectively improved cardiac physiology of I/R challenged normal rat hearts by 62.5% (RPP), reduced injury by 60% (Infarct size) and subsequently preserved mitochondrial electron transport chain enzyme activities NQR by 57%, membrane potential, swelling behaviour, ATP content, ATP producing capacity and oxidative defence system by reducing lipid peroxidation by 55% compared with I/R. But in DM and DCM animals, isolated hearts conditioned with HIPC substantially improved cardiac physiology (RPP) by 44% in DM and 58% in DCM, arrest tissue injury (Infarct size) by 72% in DM and 79% in DCM and preserved mitochondrial activity only to its own sham control, primarily due to the basal level defect. Furthermore, we found that SSM fraction of diabetic heart mitochondria showed overall better improvement in their function than IFM by HIPC. However, mitochondrion experienced I/R associated oxidative stress was not improved by HIPC. © 2019 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM)},

abstract={We investigated the electronic characteristics of graphdiyne nanosheet (Gdn-NS) using first-principles calculation. The Gdn-NS possesses the energy gap value of 0.52 eV. Also, the binding of sorafenib and regorafenib drugs have been studied by adsorption energy, charge transfer including energy gap variation. Also, the quantum molecular descriptor (QMD) such as chemical hardness, electrophilicity, and electronic chemical potential of sorafenib and regorafenib drugs on graphdiyne complex are explored. The density of states (DOS) spectrum shows the deviation in the spectrum peaks upon binding of the drug on graphdiyne sheet. The magnitude of solvation energy is moderate and reveals the solubility of the proposed drugs in the water medium. The sorafenib and regorafenib drug release to the expected target cell is studied based on protonation. Upon protonation of sorafenib and regorafenib drugs, the bond became a weak hydrogen type bond between graphdiyne sheet and drugs and released to the target cell. The findings of the proposed research reveal that the Gdn-NS can be used as a drug carrier vehicle to administer the drug to cancer affected cells. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

Since there is a need for an alternate to Li-ion batteries, the Na-ion batteries (NIB) which are cost effective and long lasting are considered as an alternate to Li-ion batteries. In order to find the suitable anode materials for Na-ion batteries, the present work focus on the surface assimilation of Na/Na+ on the bare germanene and hydrogenated germanene nanosheet and their resulting impacts. The response yielded by the bare and hydrogenated germanene nanosheets on the surface assimilation of Na/Na+ are investigated through the density of states (DOS) spectrum, adsorption energy, charge transfer, and band gap energy. Also, the adsorption of Na and Na+ ions on germanene nanosheets are explored using electron density. The tendency of Na+ to get strongly adsorbed on bare and hydrogenated germanene nanosheets suggest that germanene nanosheets can be used as anode material for NIBs. © 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Human Papillomavirus (HPV) induced cervical cancer (CaCx) is a major health problem in women from both developing and developed regions of the world. This virus accounts for >95% of the CaCx cases with a preponderance of HPV type −16 (65%). Paradoxically HPV-16 is prevalent even in the cervix of healthier women and anti HPV-16 T-cell response is considered critical for the viral clearance. Studies on HLA association with HPV-16 infection and cervical cancer have yielded varied HLA associations in different epidemiological settings. To validate these associations, we performed a meta-analysis of HLA-A, B, C, DR and DQ association with HPV-16 infection. Of the 1409 studies retrieved, 26 qualified for meta-analysis based on stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria. HLA-B*47, B*57, DRB1*10, DRB1*15 and DQB1*0303 were significantly associated with HPV-16 infection (OR = 3.4, 1.8, 1.5, 1.1 and 1.5 respectively). HLA-B*49, B*39, A28 (serotype), C*04 and DRB1*13 were negatively associated with HPV-16 (OR = 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.7, and 0.7 respectively). Certain HLA alleles such as B*07, DRB1*15, DRB1*11 and DRB1*07 showed weakly positive associations. A comprehensive analysis coupling HPV-16 antigenic diversity and the HLA variation in various global populations shall provide further insights into the immunogenetic predisposition to HPV-16 and shall help identify host-parasite co-evolution. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Using first-principles calculation, the electronic and adsorption characteristics of ammonia (NH 3 ) and phosphine (PH 3 ) gas molecules on hydrogenated armchair arsenene (arm-HAs) and hydrogenated zigzag arsenene nanoribbon (zig-HAs) are studied. Initially, the stability of HAs nanoribbons are examined with formation energy. The band gap of armchair HAs is calculated to be 1.39 eV and for zigzag HAs it is noticed to be 1.03 eV. It is found in the present framework that the arm and zig-HAs nanoribbons can be employed for recognizing toxic gas molecules like NH 3 and PH 3 . The density of states (DOS) spectrum and energy band structure ascertains the transfer of electrons between the toxic gas molecules and arm/zig-HAs nanoribbon. In addition, the adsorption behavior is substantiated from the energy band gap, electron density, adsorption energy and Bader charge transfer of the solitary and toxic gas molecules adsorbed arm/zig-HAs nanoribbon. Hence, the report reveals that both arm and zig-HAs nanoribbons can be utilized for detecting the poisonous gas molecules NH 3 and PH 3 , which shows the variation in the resistance upon adsorption. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={A new framework named three subunit sign modeling is introduced for automatic sign language recognition. This works on continuous video sequences consisting of isolated words, signed sentences under different signer variations and illuminations. Three major issues of automatic sign language recognition is addressed namely: (i) importance of discriminative feature extraction and selection (ii) handling epenthesis movements and segmentation ambiguities (iii) automatic recognition of large vocabulary sign sentences and signer adaptation in a single subunit sign modeling framework. The proposed work has been evaluated and experimented subjectively and quantitatively with real-time signing videos gathered from different corpora and different sign languages. The results of the experiments have proven that the proposed subunit sign modeling framework remains scalable while increasing the sign vocabulary. Further, the approach is more reliable and efficient enough to adapt to real-time constraints and signer independence. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The present work deals with the development of a novel photocatalyst to decompose most of the organic pollutants. This work provides a strategy for reproducible high-pressure phases of TiO2 at ambient conditions through nebulizer spray pyrolysis (NSP) technique by varying the substrate temperatures of 200–500 °C using titanium (IV) isopropoxide as a titanium precursor. The structural, morphological, optical and electrical properties of the deposited TiO2 thin films were investigated by using X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, UV–Visible spectroscopy, Hall effect and temperature dependent resistivity measurements, respectively. The structural analysis confirms that the films deposited at higher substrate temperature are crystallized in TiO2–II phase having polycrystalline nature with good crystalline quality and also pressure induced amorphous phases were also observed for the films deposited at lower substrate temperatures. Deposited films have the uniform surface with homogeneity and porous nature which is suitable for enhanced photocatalytic applications. Electrical measurements show that the films are having n-type behavior with appreciable carrier mobility and concentration. The use of high-pressure TiO2-II phase for higher photocatalytic efficiency was demonstrated. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Hybrid supercapacitors with their improved performance in energy density without altering their power density have been in trend since recent years. The hybrid supercapacitor delivers higher specific capacitance in comparison to the existing electric double layer capacitor (EDLC) and pseudocapacitors. Generally, the asymmetric behavior of hybrid supercapacitors which is the combination of EDLC and pseudocapacitor acts as an enhancer in its respective capacitance values. This asymmetric approach marks a new beginning towards the much-needed pollution free, long lasting and proficient energy-storing performance. Corresponding to their utilization in hybrid electric vehicles and similar sort of power necessity based devices; the research in developing new advanced storage devices finds an enormous and vast future ahead. The most significant factor for the energy efficient applications demands a considerably higher ratio of surface to the volume by incorporation of new materials. This review article gives an overview of recent advances in the development of hybrid supercapacitors, storage mechanism, criteria of formation, components, different electrode and electrolyte materials, electrochemical profile assessment, design fabrication and their applications. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This article studies the velocity, thermal and solutal slip effects in a squeezing flow of an upper convected Maxwell (UCM) nanofluid where the copper nanoparticles are suspended in different base fluids like water, kerosene and ethylene glycol. The dependence of velocity, temperature, concentration on salient parameters like magnetic parameter, volume fraction of nanofluid, velocity, thermal and solutal slip parameters is investigated for different base fluids in squeezing and expanding channels. A similarity solution for the governing equations is developed by using shooting method which incorporates RK4 and Newton Raphson method. In the absence of magnetic field and chemical reaction, the current numerical values of radial velocity for expanding cases are compared with previously published Newtonian nanofluid. Results show that the velocity of Newtonian ethylene glycol nanofluid is more than the velocity of non-Newtonian UCM fluid for squeezing walls. The Joule heating has an enhancing effect on the heat distribution of the ethylene glycol nanofluid when compared to water and kerosene. © 2019 by American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.},

The results show that the distribution of CHF syndrome element is as follows: root deficiency syndrome element in which disease location is dominated by heart (94.4%) and disease natures is dominated by qi deficiency (82.2%), and the superficial sthenia syndrome element dominated by the blood stagnation (70.0%). Conclusion: The CHF pathogenesis is characterized by deficient root and excessive superficiality, disease location is dominated by heart, and the symptom element of disease nature is rooted by qi deficiency and is marked by blood stagnation. Cardiac color ultrasound is an important examination method for CHF, its parameters have significant differences among the syndrome type groups, and it can be used as an important auxiliary means for CHF TCM syndrome differentiation. Different CHF syndrome types are significantly different in the levels, which can be used as important reference index for CHF TCM syndrome differentiation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

The heart sound recoding is the phonocardiogram (PCG) signal. Stethoscopes are commonly used to hear the heart sound for diagnosis. In common, the heart murmurs can be caused by a high blood pressure, heart attack, pregnancy, rheumatic fever, anemia or thyrotoxicosis. This study analyzes PCG signals spectrally with different windows with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) computations. The two PCG signals of normal and abnormal subjects in each were analyzed in this study. The normal subject produce clear “lub” and “dub” sounds where the abnormal subject produce a kind of whistling or swishing sound in middle which may be due to the problem of septal defect in a heart. The spectral leakage reduction by different windows helps to increase the SNR value. Simulation results of SNR with different windows are obtained using Matlab R2016b tool. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The primary objective of this review article is to summarize the development and structural diversity of 2D/3D molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) based modified electrodes for electrochemical sensors and biosensor applications. Hydrothermal, mechanical, and ultrasonic techniques and solution-based exfoliation have been used to synthesize graphene-like 2D MoS 2 layers. The unique physicochemical properties of MoS 2 and its nanocomposites, including high mechanical strength, high carrier transport, large surface area, excellent electrical conductivity, and rapid electron transport rate, render them useful as efficient transducers in various electrochemical applications. The present review summarizes 2D/3D MoS 2 -based nanomaterials as an electrochemical platform for the detection and analysis of various biomolecules (e.g., neurotransmitters, NADH, glucose, antibiotics, DNA, proteins, and bacteria) and hazardous chemicals (e.g., heavy metal ions, organic compounds, and pesticides). The substantial improvements that have been achieved in the performance of enzyme-based amperometry, chemiluminescence, and nucleic acid sensors incorporating MoS 2 -based chemically modified electrodes are also addressed. We also summarize key sensor parameters such as limits of detection (LODs), sensitivity, selectivity, response time, and durability, as well as real applications of the sensing systems in the environmental, pharmaceutical, chemical, industrial, and food analysis fields. Finally, the remaining challenges in designing MoS 2 nanostructures suitable for electroanalytical applications are outlined.

abstract={The polyphenolic compound resveratrol, classified under stilbenes, offers a broad range of health advantages, including neuroprotection and playing a role in autophagy in the nervous system. However, resveratrol has poor water solubility and is soluble in the gel phase in liposomal membranes. The main aim of this work was to understand the nature of the interactions between resveratrol and water molecules. In the present study, we used the dispersion corrected density functional theory (DFT) method to study hydrogen bonding interactions. Eight different geometries of resveratrol-water complexes were identified by optimizing the geometries by placing water at various locations. We observed the two lowest energy structures to be isoenergetic. In most complexes, water interaction occurs with phenolic hydrogen as all the phenolic hydroxyl groups have identical Vs,max values. Energy decomposition analysis shows that the dispersion contribution was minimal in these complexes, while electrostatic and orbital contributions were larger. Complex formation between water and the resveratrol molecule results in a blue shift in the vibrational frequency, along with an increase in intensity due to the transfer of electron density. The hydrogen bonds in the resveratrol–water complexes have closed-shell interactions with a medium-to-strong bonding nature. Noncovalent index analysis of the complexes shows that, in addition to hydrogen bonding, electrostatic and van der Waal’s interactions play a key role in stabilizing the complexes.

Stokes couple stress model is deployed to simulate non-Newtonian characteristics. Similarity transformations are utilized to convert the governing partial differential equations into nonlinear ordinary differential equations with appropriate wall and free stream boundary conditions. The nondimensional boundary value problem emerging is shown to be controlled by a number of key thermophysical and rheological parameters, namely the rheological couple stress parameter (β), unsteadiness parameter (A), Prandtl number (Pr), buoyancy parameter (λ). The semi-analytical differential transform method (DTM) is used to solve the reduced nonlinear coupled ordinary differential boundary value problem. A numerical solution is also obtained via the MATLAB built-in solver “bvp4c” to validate the results. Further validation with published results from the literature is included. Fluid velocity is enhanced with increasing couple stress parameter, whereas it is decreased with unsteadiness parameter. Temperature is elevated with couple stress parameter, whereas it is initially reduced with unsteadiness parameter. The flow is accelerated with increasing positive buoyancy parameter (for heating of the fluid), whereas it is decelerated with increasing negative buoyancy parameter (cooling of the fluid). Temperature and thermal boundary layer thickness are boosted with increasing positive values of buoyancy parameter. Increasing Prandtl number decelerates the flow, reduces temperatures, increases momentum boundary layer thickness, and decreases thermal boundary layer thickness. Excellent accuracy is achieved with the DTM approach. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Neovascularization in retina and choroid involves interplay of many cytokines and growth factors. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) being a pro-angiogenic molecule has been found to be high in aqueous and vitreous humour of patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). VEGF is also found in the fibroblast and retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE) of choroidal neovascular (CNV) membranes isolated from patients. Though anti-VEGF agents cause regression of clinically visible new vessels, there is evidence that they increase the occurrence of retinal tractional detachment and other adverse effects in PDR and CNV treatments. Adiponectin (APN) is a cytokine, found to be involved in the pathobiology of PDR. It is unclear whether APN plays a reparative or pathological role in the disease condition. In this study, we explored the effect of APN on tube formation in the primary culture of human umbilical vein macrovascular endothelial cells (HUVEC), human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (hREC) and human choroidal endothelial cells (hCEC). Anti-VEGF agent, bevacizumab (avastin) was used as a control. Full-length pAc-APN transfected in HUVEC, hRECs and hCECs inhibited basal tube formation and migration comparable to bevacizumab (Avastin™). In hRECs, full length pAc-APN reduced VEGF or PDR vitreous mediated migration. In a similar way, rAPN significantly disrupted VEGF and PDR vitreous induced tube formation in HUVEC and hREC. Moreover, rAPN significantly reduced VEGF influenced proliferation and phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in hREC. Altogether, our study suggests that APN may be effective in the treatment of retinal neovascularization. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Planarians are known for their immense regenerative abilities. A pluripotent stem cell population provides the cellular source for this process, as well as for the homeostatic cell turnover of the animals. These stem cells, known as neoblasts, present striking similarities at the morphological and molecular level to germ cells, but however, give rise to somatic tissue. Many RNA binding proteins known to be important for germ cell biology are also required for neoblast function, highlighting the importance of post-transcriptional regulation for stem cell control. Many of its aspects, including alternative splicing, alternative polyadenylation, translational control and mRNA deadenylation, as well as small RNAs such as microRNAs and piRNA are critical for stem cells. Their inhibition often abrogates both regeneration and cell turnover, resulting in lethality. Some of aspects of post-transcriptional regulation are conserved from planarian to mammalian stem cells. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Monitoring of vitamin B 12 is important in the quality control of various pharmaceutical products. In this work, we design an ultrasensitive electrochemical sensor for the detection of vitamin B 12 employing Pt modified Cu(HBTC)(4,4′-bipy)·3DMF (Pt = Platinum; DMF = N,N′-dimethylformamide; 4,4′-bipy = 4,4′-bipyridine; HBTC = 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid) electrode as an efficient electrocatalyst. The copper (Cu) complex nanorods were synthesised by solvothermal method and characterised by different surface analytical techniques. Cyclic voltammetric analysis reveals that the modified electrode shows excellent electrocatalytic redox reversibility towards Co 3+ /Co 2+ redox couple at −0.192 and -0.268 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) with a sensitivity of 0.104 µA µM −1 , a low detection limit of 50 nM, a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 and a wide linear range of 0.1–188.2 µM. The novelty of the system is that both oxidation and reduction currents Co 3+ /Co 2+ redox couple has been used for the calibration curve so that the analytical errors during the course of analysis would be minimised. The enhanced electrocatalytic ability of the material has enabled discrimination of vitamin B 12 from potential interfering species. The fabricated electrode was applied for the detection of vitamin B 12 in two commercial pharmaceutical tablets and the results were found to be satisfactory. © 2018 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers},

abstract={Background: Patients with central scotoma have poor fixation stability and poor visual acuity. Acoustic biofeedback training can be an effective way to train such patients to eccentrically fixate. This study analyses the mean retinal sensitivity, saccadic velocity, and fixation stability after acoustic biofeedback training and shows correlation with age and scotoma size. Methods: Patients with irreversible central scotoma in both the eyes secondary to macular diseases were selected. After undergoing comprehensive low vision assessment, 19 patients who were willing were recruited for the acoustic biofeedback training to the better eye in 10 sessions, using the MP-1 Microperimeter. Mean retinal sensitivity, saccadic velocity, fixation stability before and after the acoustic biofeedback were recorded. Results: There were 17 men and two women. Ages ranged from 19–94 years (mean 54.63 ± 24.66). The scotoma size ranged from four to 20 degrees. Ten patients had age-related macular degeneration, four had Stargardt disease, three had traumatic macular scar, two had scarred myopic choroidal neovascular membrane, and one had myopic macular degeneration. The vision improved from 1.06 ± 0.36 to 0.86 ± 0.33 logMAR (p < 0.0001). The mean retinal sensitivity improved from 2.1 ± 2.9 dB to 2.7 ± 3.1 dB (p = 0.01), with negative correlation with age (p = 0.01) and scotoma size (p = 0.02). Fixation stability improved with reduction in the bivariate contour ellipse area (p = 0.01). It showed negative correlation with age (p = 0.02) and scotoma size (p = 0.10). The saccadic velocity reduced from 0.34°/second to 0.26°/second but was not significant (p > 0.99). The majority (58 per cent) had their preferred retinal locus superior to the fovea. There was good agreement between bivariate contour ellipse area and MP-1 Microperimeter inbuilt fixation parameters. The effect was maintained at six months with slight reduction in fixation stability. Conclusion: Acoustic biofeedback can improve fixation behaviour, visual acuity and retinal sensitivity in patients with central scotoma. The results are better with younger age and smaller scotoma size. © 2018 Optometry Australia},

abstract={Considering spatial parallel manipulators, volume and shape of the workspace are two important parameters for optimum design. In this paper, 6-DOF 3-RRRS parallel manipulators having symmetric link lengths are the subject of research. A novel geometric method is presented to classify all possible workspace shapes with variation of all the parameters of the manipulator. For each possible workspace shape, required geometric relationships between the parameters of the manipulators are established. In each case, the volume of the workspace is also determined in closed-form expression which is very helpful for optimum design since it makes determination of the workspace volume accurate and fast. With a case study, the usefulness of closed-form expression of the volume and characterization of the workspace based on geometric condition are verified, and optimal parallel manipulators free from voids and singularities are determined for a given workspace volume. © 2018 Acta Press.All right reserved.},

abstract={Angiogenesis is a distinct process which follows sprouting angiogenesis (SA) and intussusceptive angiogenesis (IA) forming the basis for various physiological and pathological scenarios. Angiogenesis is a double edged sword exerting both desirable and discernible effects owing to the referred microenvironment. Therapeutic interventions to promote angiogenesis in regenerative medicine is essential to achieve functional syncytium of tissue constructs while, angiogenic inhibition is a key therapeutic target to suppress tumor growth. In the recent years, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats associated 9 (CRISPR-Cas9) based gene editing approaches have been gaining considerable attention in the field of biomedical research owing to its ease in tailoring targeted genome in living organisms. The Zebrafish model, with adequately high-throughput fitness, is a likely option for genome editing and angiogenesis research. In this review, we focus on the implication of Zebrafish as a model to study IA and furthermore enumerate CRISPR/Cas9 based genome editing in Zebrafish as a candidate for modeling different types of angiogenesis and support its candidature as a model organism. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Music is promoted in all traditions for the well-being of the listener. The 2-D emotion models and their effects on the brain were analyzed while listening to selected raga and at Rest. This paper visualized the functional connectivity of emotional responses to Indian Dharmavathi raga, thereby locating the similar regions across the electroencephalogram (EEG) sensor pairs. The international 10-20 sensor placement system was followed for recording EEG signals. The stimulus-based functional associations were noted, which help in investigating the neuronal synchronization. Asymmetrical alpha band energy was noticed in the frontal locations where the energy was low at F3 and F7 positions compared with F4 and F8 sensor positions. This indicates that it induces a positive emotion. The relative theta band energy at frontal locations was increased during Task (listening to Dharmavathi raga) as compared with Rest (silence) condition. The relative energy of beta band at frontal locations was significantly decreased after listening to raga. While listening to Dharmavathi raga, alpha band energy on the left frontal region was appeared to be low, and high energy was observed on the right frontal region. The raga played was evoked an increased bi-frontal theta response, which indicates that the raga is pleasant and induces mood change after listening. © 2001-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={A hybrid segmentation algorithm is proposed is this paper to extract the blood vessels from the fundus image of retina. Fundus camera captures the posterior surface of the eye and the captured images are used to diagnose diseases, like Diabetic Retinopathy, Retinoblastoma, Retinal haemorrhage, etc. Segmentation or extraction of blood vessels is highly required, since the analysis of vessels is crucial for diagnosis, treatment planning, and execution of clinical outcomes in the field of ophthalmology. It is derived from the literature review that no unique segmentation algorithm is suitable for images of different eye-related diseases and the degradation of the vessels differ from patient to patient. If the blood vessels are extracted from the fundus images, it will make the diagnosis process easier. Hence, this paper aims to frame a hybrid segmentation algorithm exclusively for the extraction of blood vessels from the fundus image. The proposed algorithm is hybridized with morphological operations, bottom hat transform, multi-scale vessel enhancement (MSVE) algorithm, and image fusion. After execution of the proposed segmentation algorithm, the area-based morphological operator is applied to highlight the blood vessels. To validate the proposed algorithm, the results are compared with the ground truth of the High-Resolution Fundus (HRF) images dataset. Upon comparison, it is inferred that the proposed algorithm segments the blood vessels with more accuracy than the existing algorithms. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) is an enzyme that initiates polyamine synthesis in human. Polyamines play key roles in cell–cell adhesion, cell motility and cell cycle regulation. Higher synthesis of polyamines also occurs in rapidly proliferating cancer cells are mediated by ODC. As per earlier studies, di-flouro-methyl-orninthine (DFMO) is a proven efficient inhibitor ODC targeting the catalytic activity, however, its usage is limited due to side effects. Targeting ODC is considered as a potential therapeutic modality in the treatment of cancer. In this study, it is attempted to use DFMO scaffold to build a ligand-based pharmocophore query using MOE to screen similar active compounds from Universal Natural Products Database with better ADMET properties. The identified compounds were virtually screened against the active cavity of ODC using Glide. Further, potential natural hits targeting ODC were shortlisted based on Molecular Mechanics/Generalized-Born/Surface Area (MM-GBSA) score. Finally, molecular dynamics simulations were performed for the natural molecule hit and DFMO in complex with ODC using Desmond. Among the hits shortlisted, 2-amino-5, 9, 13, 17-tetramethyloctadeca-8, 16-diene-1, 3, 14-triol (UNPD208110) was found to be highly potential, as it showed a higher binding affinity in terms of interactions with key active cavity residues, and also showed better ADMET property, HUMO–LUMO gap energy and more stable complex formation with ODC compared to DFMO. Hence, the proposed molecule (UNPD208110) shall be favourably considered as a potential natural inhibitor targeting ODC-mediated disease conditions. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={We have used density functional theory, Grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC), and ideal adsorption solution theory (IAST) to understand the selective adsorption of flue within the cavity of porous metallocavitand pillarplex (PPX) molecule. Energies associated with the guest@PPX complex formation depict the effectiveness of encapsulation of guest within PPX. PPX is noted to have high selectivity toward the adsorption of Br 2 , HBr, CS 2 , H 2 S, and NO 2 over their respective congeners. The strength of bonding and nature of the interaction is deciphered via quantum theory of atoms in molecule, noncovalent interaction, and energy decomposition analysis scheme. The molecules containing acidic hydrogen, viz., H 2 O, H 2 S, HF, HCl, and HBr, make hydrogen bonding with the ?N atom of the pyrazole ring, and F 2 and Cl 2 make partially covalent bonding interaction with the ?Au atom of PPX. The interaction is mostly of the van der Waals type, except in F 2 , Cl 2 , NO, and HF, in which the cumulative contribution of orbital, electrostatic, and dispersion terms are important. Furthermore, GCMC and IAST predict the quantitative capture of guest molecules and selectivity of the guest. Among the studied gases, Br 2 is the potential candidate at ambient condition, followed by CS 2 , Cl 2 , and H 2 S. At high pressure and temperature, CS 2 selectivity is more predominant. © Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={This study explores the in-plane strength of steel profile sheets and their application as load-bearing panels. The sheets are tested for concentric compression and compression with nominal eccentricity to account for possible eccentricities in load transfer. The compressive strength results obtained from the tests indicate the ultimate strengths and the failure modes of steel profile sheets. The failure modes observed also conform to the expected failure modes in thin walled steel sections. The relevance and application of various design codes to steel profile sheets are compared with the test results. The codes considered include IS 801-1975, EN 1993-1-3-2006, and the direct strength method from AISI-S100-2007. The predictions from design standards appear to be conservative which may be due to the continuous stiffened elements in profile sheets.

abstract={The effect of temperature (30–90 °C) on the electrical parameter: dielectric constant (ε r ) of Sunflower, Olive and Corn oil exposed to three cycles of heating to frying temperature (175 ± 5 °C) was studied to exhibit the quality analysis of oil. Dielectric constant of heated oil was measured using designed inter-digitated electrode capacitor at different frequency (10 kHz–5 MHz) and temperature (30–90 °C). Dielectric constant (ε r ) of oil samples increases with cycles of heating. Variation of dielectric constant with frequency was premeditated using quadratic equation and the dependency factor was observed to be R 2 &gt; 0.914. Chemical kinetic dielectric constant with temperature was studied using Arrhenius law and observed that activation energy increases with cycles of heating. Andrade’s equation was also fitted with the variation of ε r with temperature and the dependency factor (R 2 between 0.978 to 0.999) was observed to be highly correlated. Experiential physical properties like density, refractive index and ε r were significantly correlated with the pragmatic peroxide value. The observed relation between ε r with chemical property divulges the suitability of measured dielectric constant in real time and continuous evaluation of edible oil quality analysis in food industry. © 2018, Association of Food Scientists & Technologists (India).},

abstract={Multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms become a foremost health concern in both developing and developed countries. These infectious agents show a wide spectrum of resistance against different antimicrobial drugs which causes a major public health threat all over the world. In recent years bacteria, fungi, virus, and parasites started to show prominent levels of multidrug-resistance with superior morbidity and mortality. MDR Salmonellosis requires costly drugs for effective treatment, and this is an added burden to the health-care segment in developing countries. Immunization in common areas with typhoid vaccine, rational use of antibiotic, improvement in public sanitation facilities, secure food handling and communal health instruction were considered to be as vital in the prevention of salmonellosis. These health and environmental issues require collective actions from governments, consumers, pharmaceutical manufacturers and health-care providers. Two methods were followed to congregate the information in this article. Firstly, we collected a list of relevant articles published through PubMed search, which includes original as well review articles. Secondly, book chapters on typhoid fever from standard textbooks on infectious diseases and social remedy were also reviewed. © 2018 Pharmascope Publications. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Single Inductor (SI) converters with the advantage of using one inductor for any number of inputs/outputs find wide applications in portable electronic gadgets and electrical vehicles. SI converters can be used in Single Input Multiple Output (SIMO) and Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) configurations but they need controllers to achieve good transient and steady state responses, to improve the stability against load and line disturbances and to reduce cross regulation. Cross regulation is the change in an output voltage due to change in the load current at another output and it is an added constraint in SI converters. In this paper, Single Input Dual Output (SIDO) and Dual Input Dual Output (DIDO) converters with applications capable of handling high load current working in Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM) of operation are taken under study. Conventional multivariable PID and optimal Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controllers are developed and their performances are compared for the above configurations to meet the desired objectives. Generalized mathematical models for SIMO and MIMO are developed and a Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to find the parameters of a multivariable PID controller and the weighting matrices of optimal LQR where the objective function includes cross regulation as a constraint. The simulated responses reveal that LQR controller performs well for both the systems over multivariable PID controller and they are validated by hardware prototype model with the help of DT9834 ® Data Acquisition Module (DAQ). The methodologies used here generate a fresh dimension for the case of such converters in practical applications. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={Dipole-exchange spin waves (SWs) propagating in a 1-D magnonic waveguide embedded with different orientations of triangular antidots are investigated through the micromagnetic simulation. The dipole-exchange SW propagation is affected due to the effect of changing the triangular antidots orientation. This leads to reduction in the number of forbidden bands and their gap width in the magnonic waveguide. The SW characteristics are interpreted by plotting frequency dispersion curves and analyzing the power and phase distribution profile (PPDP) and static demagnetization field profile to substantiate the occurrence of bandgaps. The number of forbidden bands and their gap width get reduced due to the formation of symmetric and antisymmetric modes, and it will be further clarified by the PPDPs. For \theta = 0{\circ } , four wide bandgaps are recorded; I and II bandgaps are due to symmetric modes, whereas the remaining gaps are due to antisymmetric modes. From \theta = 0^{\circ } to 90°, the number of forbidden bands is reduced from 4 to 2 because of the inhomogeneous distribution of the internal field introduced by the presence of triangular array antidots in the transverse direction, and it is confined via the static demagnetization field. The way to develop magnonic antidot-based waveguide for SW filter applications is paved by opening, closing, and tuning of the gap width. This can be effectively brought about by changing the orientation of triangular antidots. © 1965-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={This study demonstrates the antiglycation activity of Nordihydroguaiaretic acid, a lignin from the creosote bush (Larrea tridentate), which has also been proven to assist in the treatment of cancer, neurological disorders, and cardiovascular complications. We determined the antiglycation activity of NDG based on spectroscopic analysis, molecular interactions and circular dichroism studies with albumin. It was also seen that NDG inhibits the aggregation of albumin, after glycation, using Thioflavin T binding and confocal imaging. Results suggest that NDG is a potent inhibitor of advanced glycation end products formation. NDG was found to impart protective effects on albumin by preventing glycation modification of lysine residues (Lys20, Phe36, Lys41, Lys131, and Lys132) due to glycation. © 2018},

abstract={Utilizing renewable feedstock for the production of alternate fuels is a challenging task. The need for finding a new fuel is gaining importance owing to rapid depletion of fossil-fuel resources and fluctuating crude oil price. Alternate fuel must also be environmental friendly, cheap, technically acceptable and abundant. Biodiesel, eco-friendly alternative liquid fuel, are fatty acid alkyl esters produced by chemical or lipase-catalyzed transesterification of fats or oils. It has both economic and environmental benefits in addition to its renewable origin. Feedstocks such as animal fats and vegetable oils play a vital role in biodiesel production. The demand for biodiesel production from non-comestible oil is growing steadily as there are restrictions on the conversion of edible oils into fuels. Hence, researchers are looking for promising newer sources of non-comestible oil which can sustain biodiesel production and use. These attributes have contributed to growing interest on biodiesel production from Calophyllum inophyllum oil. This study focuses on a promising newer source of non-comestible oil which can sustain biodiesel growth. Various technological options available for the conversion of C. inophyllum oil into biodiesel, their strengths and weaknesses are highlighted. Also, engine performance of the C. inophyllym biodiesel blends is also reviewed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In this paper, the self assembling properties of taurolipids were used to prepare stable copper nanoparticles (CuNPs), and demonstrated the ability of CuNPs to eradicate the biofilms formed by waterborne pathogens. The synthesized CuNPs display wine red color and exhibited surface plasmon resonance with a maximum at 590 nm. Transmission electron microscopy showed that the CuNPs are well-dispersed with spherical morphology and the size range between 5 and 12 nm. The powder X-ray diffraction study revealed that the CuNPs was free from copper oxide impurities and crystalline with the face centered cubic structure. The CuNPs exhibited excellent anti-biofilm activity against water borne pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, and Shigella flexneri. Light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) study revealed that CuNPs eliminates the mature biofilm at the minimum biofilm eradication concentration of 12.5 μM. The antimicrobial activity of the CuNPs was observed at the minimum inhibitory concentration of 25 μM, indicating the reported CuNPs exhibit true anti-biofilm effect. Fluorescence microscopy and SEM study proved that CuNPs kills the bacteria through membrane damage. The possibility to use CuNPs in cleaning biofilm formed on storage containers was demonstrated through removing the mature biofilm formed on a glass pipe. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The organic and inorganic pollutants in water stream are due to the various industrial activities, consequent to the higher level environmental contamination. Considering the high toxicity and persistent property of wastewater pollutants, sequestration before discharge into water bodies becomes an important obligation. The conventional treatment methods are mostly associated with the drawbacks of energy intensive conditions and require high investment. Biochar produced through thermal decomposition of lignocellulosic biomass in the limited oxygen conditions offer as the sustainable potential adsorbent towards wastewater pollutants removal. The current review discusses on the utilization of various lignocellulosic biomass precursor for the production of biochar. The significant parameter influence and mechanistic aspects of the biochar production using pyrolysis were critically analyzed. The recent research on biochar modifications through different physical and chemical methods to enhance biochar adsorption property was reported. The new trend of the potential application of biochar in the adsorption of heavy metals, dyes and the underlying mechanisms are comprehensively reviewed. Further explorations are required in the directions of sustainable biochar development, continuous adsorption process, industry scale applications and spent biochar management. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Fibrosis in ocular tissues causes severe visual deterioration and blindness in patients with glaucoma, cataract, age related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic retinopathy (DR). Currently available anti-fibrotic agents exhibit undesirous cytotoxic effects and thus prove ineffective to treat post-surgical fibrosis. Accordingly, there is a need to develop efficient and novel anti-fibrotic agents. Adiponectin (APN), an adipokine from adipocytes is increased in the aqueous and vitreous humor of the patients with micro-angiopathy and chronic inflammation. Furthermore, it is reported to be elevated in the subretinal fluid, vitreous and epiretinal membrane of patients with AMD, proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) respectively. Since APN has anti-angiogenic activity and reduces VEGF levels, we hypothesize that APN might regulate the angio-fibrotic switch and drive the formation of fibrovascular membrane at advanced stages of AMD, PVR and PDR. Intriguingly, APN is shown to inhibit liver, cardiac and pulmonary fibrosis, yet it accelerates renal fibrosis. Therefore, the factors such as tissue and cell type, disease specific pathological milieu and the choice of APN receptor interaction could determine the pro- or anti-fibrotic nature of APN. We speculate that APN could play a profibrotic role in the posterior segment of the eye. © 2018},

abstract={Anaerobic digestion of poultry litter is a potentially sustainable means of stabilizing this waste while generating biogas. However, technical challenges remain including seasonality of litter production, low C/N ratios, limited digestibility of bedding, and questions about transformation of nutrients during digestion. This study investigated biogas production and nutrient transformations during anaerobic digestion of poultry litter leachate and whole litter. Use of fresh litter collected from within the house was also compared to waste litter cake that was stored outdoors on the farm. The results showed that litter leachates had higher biomethane potential (0.24–0.30 L/gVS) than whole litter (0.15–0.16 L/gVS) and the insoluble bedding material left after leaching (0.08–0.13 L/gVS). Leachates prepared from waste litter cake had lower uric acid and higher acetic acid concentrations than fresh litter indicating that decomposition had occurred during storage. Consequently, waste litter cake had faster initial biogas production but lower final biogas yields compared to fresh litter. In all reactors, uric and acetic acids were completely consumed during digestion, phosphate levels decreased but ammonium levels increased. The results demonstrate that poultry litter leachate is amenable to digestion despite a low C/N ratio and that the remaining insoluble bedding material has been partially stripped of its nutrients. Moreover, litter can be stored prior to digestion but some losses in biomethane potential should be expected due to decomposition of organics during storage. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={We have theoretically demonstrated the efficient generation of nearly flattop ultrabroadband response in a periodic quasiphase matching (QPM) device using a single phase shifter domain. The flat broadband response is generated using optical parametric generation (OPG) with a QPM device of grating period Λ =27; μm. The choice of grating period and pump source depends on the group velocities of signal and idler wavelengths to match close to the degeneracy point. We have identified the location of phase shifter domain, which generates a nearly flattop OPG gain bandwidth of Δ λ =1.41; μm. The variations in broadband response are studied when the location and width of phase shifter domains are altered. When compared to a periodic device, the phase shifter domain included QPM structure exhibits higher tolerance to temperature in retaining the smoothness of the broadband response. Furthermore, we have generated the same ultrabroadband response by introducing multiple phase shifter domains at suitable locations in a periodic QPM device. © 1983-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={In the present investigation, for the first time, we report the room temperature gas sensing characteristics of Cr 2 O 3 :CuO (50:50) thin films prepared by RF magnetron sputtering technique. The X-ray diffraction data show that the prepared Cr 2 O 3 :CuO (50:50) films are amorphous nature. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic study confirmed the formation of Cr 3+ and Cu 2+ states in the films. The growth conditions induce the change in morphology of Cr 2 O 3 :CuO (50:50) films from cauliflower like structure to single nanoplate like structure, which may be due to the change in nucleation. The FTIR spectra of Cr 2 O 3 :CuO (50:50) thin films exhibit peaks between 431 cm −1 and 774 cm −1 which correspond to the characteristic stretching vibrations of Cu–O and Cr–O bonds in the films. Optical study showed the RF power induced red shift in absorption edge, which revealed the systematic reduction in optical energy band gap of the films. The activation energy (ΔE) of Cr 2 O 3 :CuO (50:50) thin films estimated from the Arrhenius plot are varied between 0.369 and 0.504 eV. The respective response and recovery times of Cr 2 O 3 :CuO (50:50) thin film sensor exposed in 25 ppm of ammonia gas are about 11 and 14 s, while that in 100 ppm, are about 51 and 53 s. The maximum sensor response of 98% was observed for 100 ppm of NH 3 gas at room temperature. The present report suggests that the RF magnetron sputtered Cr 2 O 3 :CuO (50:50) thin films can perform efficiently as a ammonia gas sensor at room temperature. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Epilepsy is a common neurological condition that can occur in anyone at any age. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals of non-focal (NF) and focal (F) types contain brain activity information that can be used to identify areas affected by seizures. Generally, F EEG signals are recorded from the epileptic part of the brain, while NF EEG signals are recorded from brain regions unaffected by epilepsy. It is essential to correctly detect F EEG signals, when and where they occur, as focal epilepsy can be successfully treated by surgical means. However, all EEG signals are complex and require highly trained personnel for right interpretation. To overcome the associated challenges, in this study a computer-aided detection (CAD) system to aid in the detection of F EEG signals has been developed, and the performance of nonlinear features for differentiating F and NF EEG signals is compared. Moreover, it is noted that nonlinear features can effectively capture concealed patterns and rhythms contained in the EEG signals. Overall, it was found that the CAD system will be useful to clinicians in providing an accurate and objective paradigm for localization of the epileptogenic area. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Lithium ion capacitor (LIC) is a promising energy storage system that can simultaneously provide high energy with high rate (high power). Generally, LIC is fabricated using capacitive cathode (activated carbon, AC) and insertion-type anode (graphite) with Li-ion based organic electrolyte. However, the limited specific capacities of both anode and cathode materials limit the performance of LIC, in particular energy density. In this context, we have developed “two in one” synthetic approach to engineer both cathode and anode from single precursor for high performance LIC. Firstly, we have engineered a low cost 1D polypyrrole nanopipes (PPy-NPipes), which was utilized as cathode material and delivered a maximum specific capacity of 126 mAh/g, far higher than that of conventional AC cathodes (35 mAh/g). Later, N doped carbon nanopipes (N-CNPipes) was derived from direct carbonization of PPy-NPipes and successfully applied as anode material in LIC. Thus, a full LIC was fabricated using both pseudo-capacitive cathode (PPy-NPipes) and anode (N-CNPipes) materials, respectively. The cell delivered a remarkable specific energy of 107 Wh/kg with maximum specific power of 10 kW/kg and good capacity retention of 93 % over 2000 cycles. Thus, this work provide a new approach of utilization of nanostructured conducting polymers as a promising pseudocapacitive cathode for high performance energy storage systems. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

abstract={Background: Practices of biopiracy to use genetic resources and indigenous knowledge by Western companies without benefit-sharing of those, who generated the traditional knowledge, can be understood as form of neocolonialism. Hypothesis: The One-World Medicine concept attempts to merge the best of traditional medicine from developing countries and conventional Western medicine for the sake of patients around the globe. Study design: Based on literature searches in several databases, a concept paper has been written. Legislative initiatives of the United Nations culminated in the Nagoya protocol aim to protect traditional knowledge and regulate benefit-sharing with indigenous communities. The European community adopted the Nagoya protocol, and the corresponding regulations will be implemented into national legislation among the member states. Despite pleasing progress, infrastructural problems of the health care systems in developing countries still remain. Current approaches to secure primary health care offer only fragmentary solutions at best. Conventional medicine from industrialized countries cannot be afforded by the impoverished population in the Third World. Confronted with exploding costs, even health systems in Western countries are endangered to burst. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is popular among the general public in industrialized countries, although the efficacy is not sufficiently proven according to the standards of evidence-based medicine. CAM is often available without prescription as over-the-counter products with non-calculated risks concerning erroneous self-medication and safety/toxicity issues. The concept of integrative medicine attempts to combine holistic CAM approaches with evidence-based principles of conventional medicine. Conclusion: To realize the concept of One-World Medicine, a number of standards have to be set to assure safety, efficacy and applicability of traditional medicine, e.g. sustainable production and quality control of herbal products, performance of placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical trials, phytovigilance, as well as education of health professionals and patients. © 2018 Elsevier GmbH},

abstract={In this paper, a novel heuristic optimization algorithm called differential evolution (DE) technique has been proposed to solve the optimal location of FACTS devices in deregulated electricity market using contingency analysis. The proposed approach deals with the optimal injection of real and reactive power using FACTS devices with an aim to minimize the total system cost, the total number of overloads, excess power flow, the severity of overload and real power loss of the network. To enhance the search behavior of the DE approach, the scaling factor and crossover parameters are empirically selected. To show the superiority of the proposed DE approach and as a step ahead to prove its novelty, the same optimization problem is solved using evolutionary programming method, and the results are compared. The results indicate the proposed DE algorithm is superior in terms of final solution quality, efficiency, convergence rate and robustness. A sample four-bus system and 24-bus EHV southern region of Indian grid system has been considered to illustrate the proposed methodology. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The structure and stability of the high energy water molecules inside the CB7 cavity was studied using the dispersion corrected density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD). The intermolecular distance between the O and H in the water molecule was found to decrease upon the encapsulation of water molecules inside the cavity, indicating the increase in the stability of water clusters. The computed binding energies were found to be sensitive to the choice of functional. Energy decomposition analysis (EDA) shows that the repulsive Pauli interaction decides the stability of the water complex. In all the encapsulated systems, except the eight water clusters, the electrostatic interactions have supremacy over the dispersive term, due to the large polarization induced by the water clusters. Molecular electrostatic potentials of entrapped systems show the charge distribution between CB7 and water clusters. QTAIM analysis indicates the existence of noncovalent intramolecular interactions between CB7 and water clusters and ellipticity values to be least for 8H2O@CB7. The topological of ρ(r) fields at the urido nitrogen plane in CB7, proves the stronger bonding with water molecules. Thus, entrapped water molecules are not electronically innocent inside the cage and have noncovalent interaction with hydrophobic part of CB7 molecule. Atom centered Density Matrix Propagation (ADMP) molecular dynamic studies shows that the water clusters are stable with respect to their isolated cluster geometry, inside the cucurbituril and the change in potential energy surface is due to the distortion in the geometry of the CB7 unit. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Gas monitoring systems have turned into a key feature in many applications in different fields, such as medicine, industry, and environmental monitoring. Accidents involving gas leakage generate massive costs and deaths, where carbon monoxide (CO) and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) are the main causes of domestic accidents. They could be avoidable with smart gas sensors integrated with other smart devices through the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. This paper focuses on the design and construction of a smart multi-gas plug-and-play sensor to avoid accidents in smart environments involving CO and LPG. This device is ready to connect on an IoT solution. It uses the standard IEEE 802.15.4 to communicate with a border router responsible to make the data available to other devices. The data will be sent to a middleware granting that other smart devices on the same context can access the information and make the correct decisions.

abstract={A novel magnetic field sensor based on the degenerate four-wave mixing (DFWM) technique is theoretically proposed using a As2S3-core silica-cladding photonic crystal fiber (PCF). In order to enhance the sensitivity, we put forth a novel design of highly nonlinear PCF where the silica cladding is doped with either Au, Ag, or Al metallic nanoparticles. The effect of volume fraction of the nanoparticles within the cladding and the size of nanoparticles are considered as the control parameters in designing the magnetic field PCF sensor to obtain high sensitivity using this novel DFWM scheme. The PCF structure of the proposed sensor is optimized with the proposed pitch of 3 μm and air hole diameter of 2.78 μm. We consider a pumping pulsed laser light with a wavelength of 2100 nm in the mid-IR regime. It has been found that the optimized PCF with Al-SiO2-cladding with small volume fraction and small nanoparticle size possess magnetic field sensitivity values of 2.74 and −0.058 nm∕Oe for the Stokes and anti-Stokes gain lines. © 2019 Optical Society of America.},

abstract={Multilevel inverters (MLIs) are an imperative solution for high power and high voltage applications. The MLIs can be classified into two categories such as symmetric and asymmetric. The asymmetric type MLIs has large number of output voltage steps with less number of input DC voltage sources and switching devices. In this paper, a single phase asymmetric (trinary sequence DC source) Cascaded H-Bridge MLI has been developed using unipolar PWM control schemes. The topology can produce 27-level output voltage with the help of 12 switches and 3 DC sources. It has been examined with a diverse combination of multicarrier unipolar PWM control. The PWM control includes Phase Disposition (PDPWM), Alternative Opposition Disposition (APODPWM), Carrier overlapping (COPWM), and Variable Frequency (VFPWM). The harmonic content of output voltage for each technique has been observed with different modulation indices. The demonstration of proposed topology for generating 27-level output voltage has been tested through simulation in MATLAB-SIMULINK and verified with laboratory-based experimental setup. From the results, it is evident that the APODPWM offers quality output voltage with relatively low harmonic distortion. Also, it has been observed that COPWM performance is superior since it delivers relatively higher fundamental RMS output voltage. © 2019 The Author(s).},

abstract={Let G = (V,E) be a simple graph. A vertex v V ve-dominates every edge uv incident to v, as well as every edge adjacent to these incident edges. A set D V is a double vertex-edge dominating set if every edge of E is ve-dominated by at least two vertices of D. The double vertex-edge dominating problem is to find a minimum double vertex-edge dominating set of G. In this paper, we show that minimum double vertex-edge dominating problem is NP-complete for chordal graphs. A linear time algorithm to find the minimum double vertex-edge dominating set for proper interval graphs is proposed. We also show that the minimum double vertex-edge domination problem cannot be approximated within for any unless NP DTIME(Formula presented).

abstract={The metabolic, physiological, and behavioral processes in most of the living organisms exhibit an approximate 24-h rhythmic, self-sustained circadian (L. circa = about, dies = day) oscillations. These oscillations, apart from passively persisting in synchrony with external cues, exist in their absence as well, conferring adaptive advantage by following environmental cycle (extrinsic adaptation) and physiological harmony (intrinsic advantage), and tackling the adverse seasonal changes. Interestingly, these circadian perturbations generated at cellular level as rhythms are pretty much hierarchically similar across unicellular organisms to complex mammals. The biological clocks (master clock along with peripheral clocks) are able to influence biological fitness, life-history traits, physiology and behavior of organism. Given that the circadian clocks influence various biological processes, its evolutionary significance remained the subject of several laboratory studies with the view that imposing artificial selection for various clock properties such as phase, period, etc., might lead to the co-evolution of associated other clock-controlled evolutionary traits. In this review, we have presented key hypotheses pertaining to circadian rhythms, where by its presence to the owner can confer adaptive advantage intrinsically and extrinsically and enable endogenous clock to perform better in synchrony with the environment. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={The silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) synthesized by physical and chemical methods are not much desirable due to the use of high energy consumption, environmentally toxic and biological hazards chemicals. Therefore green synthesis of AgNPs using natural plant extract is more appropriate method. Hence, in the present work we have employed an anti-cancer plant, which is used in Indian system of medicine Flacourtia indica to develop the AgNPs and also revealed their anticancer potential in Dalton Lymphoma Ascites (DLA) cell line model. Among the solvent extracts of F. indica, methanol extract was found to contain higher level of yield (5.14 g/100 g) and total phenolic compounds (9104 mg gallic acid equivalents/L) with good antioxidant power. Hence the preparation of methanolic extract from F. indica was optimized using Response Surface Methodology (RSM), which indicated that 88% of methanol concentration, 50 °Cof temperature and 88 min of extraction time results in higher phenolic yield. The optimized F. indica extract strongly reduced the silver into AgNPs. The synthesized AgNPs were characterized using Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy scanning (major peak at 455 nm), transmission electron microscopy (particle size of 14-24 nm) and zeta potential (-15mV). The higher level of anti-proliferative activity (76.97%) was noted for AgNPs when compared to crude extract in DLA cell line model through cytotoxicity assay. ©2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Digital images used in business, government and medical sectors insist the need for image security against various threats. An exclusive system that can make use of color spaces has been proposed to process sensitive images based on the binary curve. The proposed Encryption systeM fOr proTecting imagEs has been coined as EMOTE. This multilayered system works on binary curves as binary operations have no carries. Since binary squaring is lightweight, it is claimed to be smaller and faster in hardware than prime-field ones. Logistic mapping has been done to perform chaotic masking, which is then followed by DNA encoding in the next layer. ECC over GF(2 m ) that works on the spatial domain has been chosen as it is one of the proven technique for its mathematical strength. This proposed system can facilitate both symmetric and asymmetric combination and hence hybrid. Experimental results and the histogram analysis obtained comprehend this proposed system for its extensive deployment to process sensitive images, especially in the medical domain. Ideal measures attained for MSE, PSNR values for the standard benchmark images taken from “The whole brain atlas” database from Harvard University, substantiate the proposed EMOTE system as an expedient choice for processing sensitive images. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Secure medical data transmission is the important criteria in tele-medicine. It is helpful for getting the exact medical information at the remote specialist’s side from the local doctor. The medical image watermarking technique is used for secure medical data transmission. Electronic patient record (EPR) is embedded within the original medical image to produce the watermarked medical image for protecting the patient information. The watermarked medical image visually looks like the original medical image. Hence the attacker visually knows the medical image transmission and easily attacks the system. To avoid this situation, image encryption technique is used to change the visual structure of the watermarked medical image. Normal image encryption gives the noise-like or texture-like unknown image format which indicates an existence of some secret information as the encrypted image. To overcome this problem, this paper proposed a visual medical image encryption technique to protect the existence of the watermarked medical image. And to ensure the source authentication, a biometric based authentication is also proposed. The watermarked medical image is encrypted using the proposed visually meaning full image encryption along with the fingerprint image. Experimental results prove that the proposed method yields good results and mitigate the attacker challenges. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={We have used density functional theory, Grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC), and ideal adsorption solution theory (IAST) to understand the selective adsorption of flue within the cavity of porous metallocavitand pillarplex (PPX) molecule. Energies associated with the guest@PPX complex formation depict the effectiveness of encapsulation of guest within PPX. PPX is noted to have high selectivity toward the adsorption of Br 2 , HBr, CS 2 , H 2 S, and NO 2 over their respective congeners. The strength of bonding and nature of the interaction is deciphered via quantum theory of atoms in molecule, noncovalent interaction, and energy decomposition analysis scheme. The molecules containing acidic hydrogen, viz., H 2 O, H 2 S, HF, HCl, and HBr, make hydrogen bonding with the ?N atom of the pyrazole ring, and F 2 and Cl 2 make partially covalent bonding interaction with the ?Au atom of PPX. The interaction is mostly of the van der Waals type, except in F 2 , Cl 2 , NO, and HF, in which the cumulative contribution of orbital, electrostatic, and dispersion terms are important. Furthermore, GCMC and IAST predict the quantitative capture of guest molecules and selectivity of the guest. Among the studied gases, Br 2 is the potential candidate at ambient condition, followed by CS 2 , Cl 2 , and H 2 S. At high pressure and temperature, CS 2 selectivity is more predominant. © 2019 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Hiding secret information in a cover, which is of same type or different type is called Steganography. The main goal of the Steganography is that the sharing of secret information should not be shown to the intermediaries during communication. Several algorithms have been developed having different kinds of cover media, such as text, image, audio or video. We propose an approach to convert a secret message, which is available as Tamil text document into a gray-scale image that can be created of any size based on the size of the secret message by the sender, and that is transmitted over communication channel. At the hiding end, the characters in the tamil text document are encoded after encryption, then the image is scanned row by row, and in each non black pixel four characters are hidden. Only if the color of a pixel is not black, then the characters are hidden into it. At the extraction end, the characters are extracted after finding that the pixel is not in black color. This proposed method shows an agreeable experimental result with the cover image chosen. The efficiency of this proposed method is that the size of the stego image is lesser than the size of the secret message. Security can be increased by encrypting the secret text before embedding into the cover image. © 2006-2019 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).},

abstract={Rapid growth in the mobile technology manifolds the usage of mobile devices. It leads to the development and popularity of mobile application in diversified domains like finance, commerce, and government services. Extensive services can be explored conveniently and cost-effectively from these applications using speaker recognition based authentication to determine the identity of the individuals requesting service. Speech template that is stored in these mobile devices necessitates the prime concern of preserving the private data from unauthorized access and privacy breaches. It is highly feasible to prove the authenticity of the person using speech as a biometric to ensure that the rendered services are accessed only by the legitimate user. If the speech template stored in the database for comparison is compromised, then the authentication process will become obsolete. This issue had motivated the need for highly secured, faster and lightweight model named as (SCAN) - Speech biometriC templAte protectioN system based on the genus-2 hyper elliptic curve. Mobile devices are smaller in size and often restricted by memory and power constraints. Hence it requires a cryptosystem with lesser key size offering the higher degree of security and guard against sophisticated attacks. The proposed SCAN system provides the complete solution for this challenge uniquely by designing genus-2 hyper elliptic curve cryptosystem for speech template. The elaborate analysis from the results traces ideal values for MSE, PSNR, BRT, and EUD. This ratifies the suitability of this work that craves for higher encryption and decryption reliability. It offers high resistance to various attacks as it involves HECC that comes under the category of discrete logarithmic problem. This SCAN system can also reap the benefit of light weight processing, better ERR and authentication accuracy with induced parallelism. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Ultrasound imaging has been widely used in the diagnosis of atherosclerosis. To precisely diagnose the carotid plaque, the affected region should be segmented from the ultrasonic image of carotid artery. Many techniques have been used to identify the plaque in ultrasound images. Image enhancement and restoration are the important processes to acquire high-quality images from the noisy images. When the artery images are captured, noise occurs due to high-frequency rate. To acquire a high-quality image, preprocessing is the first step to be done. The quality of the image is improved in this process. The techniques involved in preprocessing are dealt in this paper. Preprocessing involves filtering the image and removing the noise by various filtering techniques. Salt-and-pepper and Gaussian noise in ultrasound images can be filtered using techniques like mean, median and Wiener filters. Salt-and-pepper noise is multiplicative in nature and it is introduced by the image acquisition mechanism. The quality of the input sensor is reflected by the Gaussian noise. In this paper, the performance of image enhancement techniques on ultrasound images are evaluated using quality metrics, namely Mean Square Error (MSE) and Peak Signal–to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

abstract={Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) is evolving as the successful way of monitoring patient health and offers enhanced healthcare solutions to provide the better quality of life for the urban community. As it involves wireless communications, securing the privacy-related data is a key constraint in WBAN. To ensure privacy, it is essential to include authentication to prevent unauthorized access by intruders. This paper proposes the privacy preserving LightwEight two factors Authentication Protocol (LEAP) for WBAN based on genus-2 Hyper Elliptic Curve (HEC). Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) collects signals from sensors from the BAN. PDA transmits the healthcare data to the Healthcare Service Provider (HSP) connected in the public network. Hence, the two-factor mutual authentication protocol is established between PDA and HSP. Since PDA is considered as a resource constraint device, the lightweight mutual authentication is required. Genus 2 Hyper elliptic curve (HEC) is carefully designed to prevent all possible cryptographic attacks, which is more suitable for lightweight authentication since it provides the high degree of security with the lesser key size even as compared to the elliptic curve. Using the rigorous formal security analysis using BAN logic, it is proved that the proposed scheme is secure against possible attacks. Also, the privacy preserving lightweight authentication scheme is implemented using the most-widely accepted Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool, and the simulation results reveal that proposed scheme is secure and robust. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Mammography is a technique which uses X-rays to take mammographic images of the breast, but identifying abnormalities from a mammogram is a challenging task. Many Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems are developed to aid the classification of mammograms, as they search in digitized mammographic images for any abnormalities like masses, microcalcification which is difficult to identify especially in dense breasts. The first step in designing a CAD system is preprocessing. It is the process of improving the quality of the image. This paper focuses on the techniques involved in preprocessing the mammogram images to improve its quality for early diagnosis. Preprocessing involves filtering the image, applying image enhancement techniques like Histogram Equalization (HE), Adaptive Histogram Equalization (AHE), Contrast-Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), Contrast Stretching, and Bit-plane slicing; filtering techniques like mean, median, Gaussian and Wiener filters are also applied to the mammogram images.

abstract={High computation power and storage space are needed to execute the complex scientific workflows. Cloud computing resources are used effectively to execute such complex workflows. Tasks executing in the workflow is dependent in nature and hence failure of a task affects the overall performance of the execution. In order to execute the workflow without any interrupt, a proactive intelligent fault tolerant model is necessary. This paper proposes a model called cognitive fault tolerant (CFT) with three important phases for tolerating the task and VM failure proactively. In prediction phase, combined ensemble prediction method is used to predict the task failures and label tuning algorithms are used to generate the intermediate labels and to strengthen the prediction. The segregation phase isolates the task based on priority assignment. Last phase of CFT model is recovery. Fitness checking is used to find whether the predicted failure is due to task or VM. Post prediction checkpointing (PPC) method is used as recovery process for task failure. VM failure can be recovered using post or pre replication overlapped migration method. The validation of proposed CFT model can be done by comparing with other existing algorithms. Experimental analysis shows that proposed CFT model improvise the reliability of workflow execution in cloud environment. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The adsorption of cyanogen fluoride and chloride gas molecules on red phosphorene (RP) nanosheet was investigated using the first-principles calculation. We confirmed the geometric solidity of RP nanosheet using the formation energy and the energy band gap is detected to be 0.72 eV. The most stable adsorption configurations of cyanogen halides are studied by energy band gap variation, Bader charge transfer, and adsorption energy. We observed the physisorption type of interaction upon exposure of cyanogen halides on RP nanosheet. Furthermore, the band gap structure along with the density of states spectrum indicates the physisorption of cyanogen halide on RP nanosheet. The variation in the band gap upon adsorption leads to modify the resistance of RP nanosheet. The findings show that RP nanosheets can be used to detect the presence of cyanogen chloride and fluoride.

abstract={This paper deals with the design, simulation, and implementation of shunt hybrid compensator to maintain the power quality in three-phase distribution networks feeding different types balanced and unbalanced nonlinear loads. The configuration of the compensator consists of a selective harmonic elimination passive filter, a series-connected conventional six-pulse IGBT inverter, acting as the active filter terminated with a DC link capacitor. The theory and modelling of the compensator based on current harmonic components at the load end and their decomposition in d-q axis frame of reference are utilized in the reference current generation algorithm. Accordingly, the source current waveform is made to follow the reference current waveform using a high-frequency, carrier-based controller. Further, this inner current control loop is supported by a slower outer voltage control loop for sustaining desirable DC link voltage. Performance of the compensator is evaluated through MATLAB simulation covering different types of loads and reduction of harmonic currents and THD at the supply side along with excellent regulation of DC link voltage are confirmed. The performance of a hybrid compensator designed and fabricated using the above principles is evaluated and corroborated with the simulation results. © 2019 by the authors.

abstract={Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems have been helping us in various fields including the medical diagnosis of various diseases where the CAD generated output is taken as complementary to the doctor's view. EEG signals which pick up the electrical activity of the brain are fed into a CAD system to further analyze and confirm the underlying abnormality. Neurological disorders affect a person and can make one's day to day activities difficult which mainly deals with the brain's electrical activity. Autism and Epilepsy are two of the major neurological disorders which can be analyzed through CAD systems. Alzheimer's disease can also be diagnosed with the help of a CAD system. Signal processing is used to take the input EEG signal and then process or decompose it to help us in analyzing. Few of the many processing techniques include FFT, DCT, DWT etc., Four features are extracted from a processed signal like Shannon entropy, Band power, Standard deviation and Largest Lyapunov Exponent which enhance the study of the signal. The feature vector is formed which is then fed to different classifiers whose main purpose is to classify as a normal or an abnormal signal. Some of the classifiers used KNN, ANN, SVM and LDA in which KNN provides the best help in recognizing the abnormality in a short period of time. In this paper we study the usage of few techniques, features, classifiers and give emphasis to the advantages of using DWT, Shannon entropy and KNN which helps us get an efficient and better understanding of the abnormality. © 2019 Systematic Reviews in Pharmacy.

abstract={In recent years, owing to the improving global socio-economic conditions, the number of air passengers grows rapidly. Despite the phenomenal increase in the passenger growth, the airline fuel cost continues to dominate with 27% of the total airline operating cost. Induced drag due to the pressure differential induced between the wings being the major contributor accounts for 25% of total drag at cruise to around 60% during take-off. With a view to overcome this, end plates were introduced in the 1980s to reduce the wingtip vortices. Several studies have been performed by researchers over various configurations and found that the angle at which the winglets are inclined greatly influences the strength of the wingtip vortices shed away from the winglets. In order to understand the effect of eccentricity on aerodynamic performance, a baseline swept wing with vertical winglets and seven different modified models featuring curved winglets with different eccentricities were computationally investigated for various angles of attack at Re = 4.0 × 10 6 . Results reveal that the curved semi-spiroid winglet with eccentricity e (0.2) outperforms clean wing showing a 9.85% increment in the aerodynamic efficiency over the pre-stall regions. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.},

abstract={The aerodynamic characteristics of introducing roughness on an airfoil surface are measured in a subsonic wind tunnel. The roughness is introduced on one-fourth of the chord length, and experiments are conducted. In conventional airfoils, there is a substantial decrease in the coefficient of lift once the critical angle of attack is attained. This affects the aerodynamic performance of aircraft. Though there are methods to resolve this, there are drawbacks too, such as an increase in takeoff weight, which are detrimental to the overall performance. To avoid such drawbacks and still achieve delayed stalling, roughness is introduced on the airfoil surface. The pressure is measured for various angles of attack from 2° to 18° in steps of 2°, for inlet velocities of 25, 35, and 45 m/s. A delay in stalling has been achieved, from 8° to 12°, but there is a fall in the lift coefficient compared to that of a conventional airfoil, due to the addition of skin friction to the airfoil surface. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.},

abstract={In boilers, there is a need of bent pipes to direct the flow of steam/air in and out of a boiler. Usually, bent pipes are preferred than welded pipes. When a pipe is bent, wall thickness of the pipe tends to decrease on the outer side of the bending. When a pipe is not bent properly, it leads to excess wall thinning. Wall thickness is the main criteria that govern the strength of a pipe, because whenever a high-pressure fluid flows through the bend it should withstand the pressure. In cold bending at normal temperature, various fillers are used to reduce the effect of wall thinning. In incremental hot bending, the effect of wall thickness has been studied by varying bend radius of the pipe and percentage change in wall thinning and its effects are observed. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.},

abstract={With the current boom in smartphones and social media, image sharing faces problems, like redundant data. Thereby, compromises the storage of a user’s device. In this paper, we design an image hashing and verification technique to check for redundancy. The algorithm creates a hash of the image and is stored along with the image before sending. Upon receiving an image, its hash code is retrieved from the image and is cross referenced with the lookup table in the device. If an entry already exists, the received image is discarded. This reduces the storage of redundant images in the device and thereby avoids wastage of device memory. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

abstract={The electronic and mechanical properties of AlGaN and InGaN were analyzed in the pressure range of 0 GPa to 50 GPa by the first-principles study. Moreover, the energy band structure gets modified upon increasing pressure. The density of states (DOS) spectrum of AlGaN and InGaN shows the shift in the peaks upon increase in the pressure. The elastic constants for rhombohedral AlGaN and InGaN were established. By estimating the Young's, bulk and shear moduli, an upsurge in the magnitude was observed with the intensifying pressure. The ductility of AlGaN and InGaN were demonstrated by examining the Poisson's ratio, Cauchy's pressure and Pugh's criterion under increasing the pressure. We observed increase in the ductility of AlGaN and InGaN upon applied pressure. Thus, the findings suggest that the band gap of AlGaN and InGaN can be fine-tuned on applying the pressure, which is suitable to fabricate new optoelectronic devices. © 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The industrial and technological advancements in the world have also contributed to the rapid deterioration in the environment quality through introduction of obnoxious pollutants that threaten to destroy the subtle balance in the ecosystem. The environment contaminants cause severe adverse effects to humans, flora and fauna that are mostly irreversible. Chief among these toxicants is arsenic, a metalloid, which is considered among the most dangerous environmental toxins that leads to various diseases which affect the quality of life even when present in small quantities. Treatment of arsenic-mediated disorders still remains a challenge due to lack of effective options. Chelation therapy has been the most widely used method to detoxify arsenic. But this method is associated with deleterious effects leading various toxicities such as hepatotoxicity, neurotoxicity and other adverse effects. It has been discovered that indigenous drugs of plant origin display effective and progressive relief from arsenic-mediated toxicity without any side-effects. Further, these phytochemicals have also been found to aid the elimination of arsenic from the biological system and therefore can be more effective than conventional therapeutic agents in ameliorating arsenic-mediated toxicity. This review presents an overview of the toxic effects of arsenic and the therapeutic strategies that are available to mitigate the toxic effects with emphasis on chelation as well as protective and detoxifying activities of different phytochemicals and herbal drugs against arsenic. This information may serve as a primer in identifying novel prophylactic as well as therapeutic formulations against arsenic-induced toxicity. © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS},

It becomes essential to control the severity of the problems like optimal reactive power dispatch (ORPD) erected during decentralization. Over the years various optimization mechanisms which are nature-inspired meta-heuristic have been introduced to handle ORPD. The Objective of this paper dealing with Optimal Reactive Power Dispatch (ORPD) is to minimize active power transmission loss using Directional Bat methodology (DBA) while varying decision variables such as voltage limits of generator terminals, tap settings of online tap changing transformer and reactive power output of shunt VAR compensators. DBA has been tested on IEEE 14—Bus and IEEE 57—Bus systems. The acquired results through DBAT methodology to solve ORPD problem is compared with various optimization methodologies (Particle swarm optimization, Genetic algorithm, etc.) to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in handling the optimal reactive power dispatch (ORPD) problem. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

Spring steel is corrosion resistant, and it exhibits high tensile strength and has high formability. Because of its desirable properties, it finds application in automotive and industrial suspension applications. The effects on microstructural and mechanical properties are analyzed in this study. Severe plastic deformation causes refinement of the grain structure, and it has been observed after the process. The ECAP was performed at different corner angles φ = 120° and 150° with the radius of curvature ψ = 20° through route A. The microstructural and mechanical properties were analyzed. After the pass, the values of hardness and tensile strength were measured for the different angles. After processing the sample, more columnar structures were observed in 120°, and uniformly distributed grains with equiaxed and less columnar structures were observed in 150°. This is mainly due to the occurrence of grain strengthening effect at the corner angles. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

This investigation was carried out with optical microscopy and was found that TiO2 reinforcement particles are disintegrated and distributed homogenously by the stirring action of the tool, which also forges the plasticized material. The hardness profile was obtained using Vickers microhardness test across the thermomechanically affected zone and welded zone and found that the retreating side had more hardness.

abstract={Multiphase fluid flows commonly occur in petrochemical, biotech, food, and process industries. Extraction and flow of crude oil is an example of multiphase solid, liquid, and gas flows. In this paper, the output signal characteristics of an infrared (IR) transceiver sensing system during the two-phase flows of air-water mixture inside a 2.64 mm diameter and 0.30-mm-thick glass tube is presented. An optimized distance between IR LED (transmitter) and center of the test section is predicted using COMSOL Multiphysics so that the receiver senses maximum number of photons. The experiments are done for the optimized distance to analyze bubble/slug of varying length and shapes. High-speed imaging is used for image registration of the flow regimes. A numerical model is developed with COMSOL package to understand the signal characteristics for multiple bubble/slug of varying sizes and is validated with the experimental results. Also with the developed model, a method is proposed to predict the liquid film thickness in mini/microtubes of diameters 3.42, 1.51, and 0.62 mm inner diameter and 0.60-, 1.50-, and 2.57-mm thickness, respectively. The results can be used to design IR transceiver array to measure the liquid film thickness in two-phase flow online. © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Sentiment analysis and opinion mining has become a major tool for collecting information from customer reviews on user sentiments and emotions, especially for online video streaming services and social networks. The increasing use of smartphones has popularized subscription to various streaming services that provide streaming media and video-on-demand. These applications offer a gateway to analyze user reviews by introducing sentiment analysis in the mobile environment. Online user reviews can hold a lot of useful information and help predict user interests. Analysis of user reviews can provide substantive information for business processing. Sentiment classification of these reviews is a commonly used analysis technique. Usually, these reviews are given in a text format, with every word in each considered a feature, so selection should focus on optimal features from all available features present in the reviews. This study employs machine learning algorithms to extract the best features from the training review data set. Then, the selected features are fed into the convolutional neural network and other fully connected layers for further processing. The proposed approach is evaluated with the standard evaluation metrics, such as precision, accuracy, recall, and f-measure, using three distinct benchmark data sets: polarity, Rotten Tomatoes, and IMDb. This work has also employed a pretrained sentiment analysis model over an Android application framework to classify reviews on a Smartphone without the need for any cloud or server-side API. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={True grammar checking of a language is more complex. One can mark to some extent a whole appropriate grammar for a natural language, but there is generally variety of exceptions in genuine practice that a formal grammar is of negligible help in writing a grammar checker. The most significant parts of a grammar checker of a natural language is a dictionary of complete set of the words in that particular language, accompanied with the part of speech of each word. The fact that all the words can obtain many different parts of speech significantly enhances the complexity of every grammar checker. The proposed work is based on the natural language processing for Grammatical Analysis of English Text. The work has the base idea of the syntactical and the grammatical analysis of the English text by tokenization without the use of the trained data sets. Grammar checking without the data set is the main advantage of the proposed system where in the new patterns can be added to the system without any training to the system. © 2006-2019 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).},

abstract={The penultimate point of underwater wireless sensor communication is the one-hop neighbor sensor node nearer to the sink. This region of one-hop sensor node is subjected to many problems due to traffic intensity. Hence, interpreting the packet forwarding at its one-hop neighbor incorporating environment model is important. The channel conditions are altered with environment conditions causing an offset in sound speed. The difference in propagation speed of underwater environment causes a drift in synchronization of nodes affecting the communication. Proper synchronization is needed at its one-hop neighbor with spatial coordinates and temporal coordinates. The spatial coordinates here denote different depth and same depth of sensors. The temporal coordinates here denote the response time in forwarding packets. Underwater Time Synchronization protocol with Weibull Metrics (UTSWM) has been proposed. UTSWM protocol calculates the mean life time of failure for the entire network at its one-hop neighbor. Subsequently, mean time to repair for the entire network based upon the different time epochs of simulation are done. Then, the bottleneck effect at its one hop has been reduced within the time epoch using proper data transfer rate and propagation time. Simulation verification of UTSWM protocol has been done with aquasim under various scenarios. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Malachite green (MG) is a synthetic cationic dye widely used in the textile industry as a coloring agent. It is reported to be a potential carcinogenic and mutagenic agent for the living organisms in nature. Hence, it is essential to treat and release the industrial effluents containing MG to avoid serious and irreversible effects to both the natural environment and living organisms. An effective method for mitigating the effects of toxic industrial dye is by utilizing microorganism to degrade it to non-hazardous compounds. Lasiodiplodia sp is a novel fungus species isolated from biota containing a high concentration of xenobiotics. It exhibits the ability to degrade malachite green in a wide range of temperatures (20 °C - 45 °C) and pH (3–12). The maximal degradation of MG was found to be 96.9% given the dye concentration of 50 mg/L, pH of 7 and temperature of 30 °C. The maximum rate of dye degradation was determined using Hanes–Woolf plot and found to be 123.5 mg-MG/g-cell/h. FTIR analysis endorses the conversion of MG into aromatic amides, carboxylic acids, alkenes and alkane suggesting that decolorization is occurred through oxidation of dyes by the action of laccases. X-ray diffraction analysis indicated that degradation was established by the process of bio adsorption and mineralization of dye in fungi mycelium. Chemical stability test on fungi mycelium indicated that the newly isolated species confer stability under adverse reaction conditions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

Optimizing polymer – nucleic acid ratio is the key stage in elaboration of procedures in this area. Application of fluorescent tagged oligonucleotides is widespread approach which allows to visualize nucleic acid in gel electrophoresis experiments and to find conditions of the full binding of the nucleic acid. We suggest to use succinimidyl ester of 7-(diethylamino)coumarin-3-carboxylic acid as an agent for fluorescent labeling of polymeric amines and to use the tagged polymers in optimizing polymer – nucleic acid ratio. This approach allows to see unbound polymer and to study various nucleic acids in interaction with the same polymer. • Labeling of gene delivery agents with fluorescence groups increases efficiency of optimization of gene delivery compositions. • Polymeric amines tagged with succinimidyl ester of 7-(diethylamino)coumarin-3-carboxylic acid are suitable for study polymer – nucleic acid interaction with gel electrophoresis. © 2019},

The origin of the resident immune cells of the skin has become a focus of interest over past a decade. Fate mapping studies have revealed that the macrophages home into the skin as early as E12.5 and are derived from the yolk sac and fetal liver. The resident γδT cells are born in the thymus and home to the skin by E16.5. Recent work from our lab has shown that the embryonic macrophages can actively remodel the extracellular matrix in skin suggesting that the skin immune system can be activated long before exposure to foreign antigens.

abstract={Development of modern technology has increased thrust for renewable energy. The land-based resources were used to its maximum potential. India with a coastline of 7,517 km is seeking to meet its demand from offshore resources like offshore wind energy through installation of offshore wind turbines. Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) has identified the coasts of Gujarat and Tamil Nadu as potential sites. The wind potential was assessed either using satellite winds or extrapolated onshore winds, which include considerable uncertainties. Before setting up an offshore wind farm, it is mandatory to collect bankable wind data for a couple of years at potential location. In the present study, an initiative has been taken to come up with a low-cost and feasible structure for the collection of wind data considering financial constraints in prefeasibility stages. Feasibility of using conventional onshore-based-guyed met mast in offshore environment by replacing the anchorage with suction pile foundation was studied. The structure was modeled using beam elements and analyzed for environmental loads using finite element method. The deflected profiles of the structure were arrived and are in acceptable limits. Free vibration analysis was performed to study the resonance of the structure due to wave loads. Earthquake analysis was performed using spectral and time history methods and the utilization factors are in acceptable limits. A nonlinear static pushover analysis was carried out and results indicate reserve strength ratio of 2.2. An installation methodology was developed for the proposed structure considering available marine spread in Indian waters. Preliminary cost estimates indicated the cost of proposed structure to be less than conventional offshore self-standing mast and LiDAR-based platform. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.},

In this article, the authors present a new travel RS employed on the mobile device to generate personalized travel planning comprising of multiple Point of Interests (POIs). The recommended personalized list of travel locations will be predicted by generating a heat map of already visited POIs and the highly relevant POIs will be selected for recommendation as destinations. To enhance the recommendation quality, this article exploits the temporal features for increased user visits. A personalized travel plan is recommended to the user based on the user selected POIs and the proposed travel RS is experimentally evaluated with the real-time large-scale dataset.

It is commonly known as Kalmegh, is found in the plains of India, China, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and South Asia and is native to India and Sri Lanka. Kalmegh is known to be the "king of bitters" though it is of small size and it also has a similar appearance and taste as that of the Neem plant. It is one of the widely used effective medicinal plants in the world. All parts of this plant are used to extract the potential phytochemical, but the composition of phytoconstituents mostly differs from one part to another in a season, place and time of harvest. It is a traditional medicinal plant widely used in the treatment of anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, anti-oxidant, hepatoprotective, hematocidal, anti-HIV, anticancer, anti-diabetic, arthritis, rheumatism, cough, cold, multiple sclerosis, depression, diarrhoea, dysentery, candida, fevers, herpes, leprosy, malaria, jaundice, tuberculosis and several infectious diseases ranging from malaria to dysentery. The plant is widely used in Ayurvedic and homeopathic system of medicine. The medicinal value of this plant is due to the active ingredients via andrographolide and neoandrographolide, which are derivative of diter-pinoids.

abstract={The maturity and stability of the widely used service paradigm have brought in a variety of benefits not only for software applications but also all kinds of connected devices. Web Services hide all kinds of device heterogeneities and complexities and present a homogeneous outlook for every kind of devices. Manufacturing machines, healthcare instruments, defence equipment, household utensils, appliances and wares, the growing array of consumer electronics, handhelds, we are able, and mobiles are being empowered to be computing, communicative, sensitive and responsive. Device services are enabling these connected devices to interact with one another in order to fulfil various business requirements. XML, JSON and other data formats come handy in formulating and transmitting data messages amongst all kinds of participating applications, devices, databases and services. In such kinds of extremely and deeply connected environments, the data security and privacy are being touted as the most challenging aspects. It should be noted that even security algorithms of steganography and cryptography provides us with the probability of 0.6 when it comes to protection in a service environment. Having understood the urgent need for technologically powerful solutions for unbreakable and impenetrable security, we have come out a security solution using the proven and promising RFID technology that has the power to reduce the probability of device-based attacks such as brute-force attack, dictionary attack and key-log-related attacks—which would make the device applications and services immune from malicious programmes. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Purpose: To elucidate the clinical profile of visual impairment (VI) and rehabilitation of the uveitic patients with irreversible low vision. Methods: Retrospective analysis of visual rehabilitation of patients with uveitis suffering from poor vision with low vision devices (LVD). Results: Most common cause of uveitis was choroiditis (46.29%), followed by retinitis (25.92%), retinochoroiditis (18.51%), and chronic panuveitis sequelae (9.25%). Of these 54 cases, 35.18% had moderate VI, 25.92% had severe VI, 20.37% had mild VI, and 18.51% had profound VI or blindness. Statistically significant improvement (P < 0.05) in near vision was seen in choroiditis (52%) and retinitis (72%), whereas clinically significant improvement in distance vision was found in patients with choroiditis. Most commonly prescribed LVD was half-eye prismatic spectacle magnifier (22.2%). Conclusion: Rehabilitation of the uveitic patients with low vision is challenging. LVD may be a beneficial tool in these patients to help them perform their day-to-day activities independentl.y. © 2018 Indian Journal of Ophthalmology Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.},

abstract={Recent developments in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and online healthcare services have created a huge volume of health data. With the advancements in machine learning approaches, the research on Disease Prediction Support System (DPSS) has attracted many researchers globally. In this article, we present a hybrid reasoning-based methodology on predicting diseases. The combinatorial advantage of Fuzzy sety theory, k-nearest neighbor and case-based reasoning helps to yield enhanced prediction results. Though DPSS facilitates promising healthcare services, data security and privacy are still crucial challenging issues to be addressed. The DPSS is extended as a Privacy-Aware Disease Prediction Support System (PDPSS) using Paillier Homomorphic Encryption to preserve patients’ sensitive information from unauthorized user access. The proposed prediction model is evaluated with the statistical evaluation metrics, and the experimental results reveal the improved performance of PDPSS in enhanced prediction accuracy and better security. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={An extensive experimental study aims to enhance the structural performance of masonry by using meshes on the surfaces of brick units and bed joints. The novel mesh embedment technique of masonry units is supported with the least expensive meshes. They are 0.71 mm thick GI expanded wire mesh (EWM), 0.41 mm thick SS stainless steel mesh (SSM) and 0.33 mm thick SS poultry netting mesh (PNM) or chicken wire mesh are the three types of embedded mesh used in this novel approach. The mesh embedded masonry technique (MEM) administers by alternative sides of bricklayer that passes through bed joints. To envisage brickwork quality, reasonable trial programs are necessary like the compressive strength of twenty masonry prism with height to thickness ratio of 1.6 as per the ASTM C1314, the flexural bond strength of thirty three masonry prism as indicated by the ASTM E518 Test method A and small-scale diagonal shear (Tension) test on six masonry panel as per the ASTM E519. The present study concedes that the embedment of meshes increases the strength and ductile performance of masonry units. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) can be characterized as the extraction of the emotional condition of the narrator from their spoken utterances. The detection of emotion is troublesome to the computer since it differs according to the speaker. To solve this setback, the system is implemented based on Adaptive Fractional Deep Belief Network (AFDBN) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). Pitch chroma, spectral flux, tonal power ratio and MFCC features are extracted from the speech signal to achieve the desired task. The extracted feature is then given into the classification task.

abstract={This work presents the modules for authenticating the persons by using speech as a biometric against recorded playback attacks. It involves the implementation of feature extraction, modeling technique and testing procedure for authenticating the persons. Playback attacks are simulated by recording the original speech utterances using the speakers and mikes in a laptop using Audacity software. This work mainly involves the process for distinguishing original and recorded speeches and authenticating the speakers based on voice as a biometric. Features extracted from the original and recorded speeches are used to develop models for them. Voice passwords are assigned to the speakers and features are extracted from the training speech created by fusing the password specific original speech utterances. These features are applied to the training algorithm to generate password specific speaker models. Testing procedure involves the feature extraction and application of features to the models pertaining to recorded and original speech models. If the test speech belongs to the recorded speech, it is prevented from undergoing the further process. If it is an original speech, feature vectors of the test speech are applied to the password specific speaker models and based on the classification criteria, a speaker is identified and authenticated. Our system is found to be robust against playback attacks and has given better performance in authenticating sixteen speakers considered in our work. Passwords are isolated words and digits chosen from “TIMIT” speech database. This work is also extended to using AVSpoof database for authenticating 44 speakers against replay attacks and the performance is analyzed in terms of rejection rate. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Flavonoids and their derivatives have been extensively studied for their pharmaceutical applications due to their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The coordination complexes of several flavonoids have demonstrated DNA binding ability that can confer anticancer properties. The structure of the flavonoid has a pronounced influence on its pharmacological properties. Herein we report the synthesis and characterization of alkylated quercetin and its complex with gadolinium. The structure of the complex was confirmed using spectroscopic techniques. The ability of the gadolinium-alkylated quercetin complex to serve as a magnetic contrast agent was compared with gadolinium-quercetin complex. The quercetin-gadolinium complex was found to exhibit better contrast property with a relaxivity of 0.2952 μg mL -1 s -1 when compared to the gadolinium complex of alkylated quercetin. This difference primarily arises due to the greater hydrophobicity of the alkylated quercetin complex that restricts access of water. However, the alkylated quercetin was found to exhibit better enzyme mimic activity as the metal ion served as a redox center that enabled quantification of hydrogen peroxide in the concentration range 50-450 μM within 5 s with a sensitivity of 64 nA/μM and limit of detection of 7.3 μM. The better sensing performance of the alkylated quercetin-gadolinium complex, reported here for the first time, when compared to quercetin-gadolinium complex can be attributed to the enhanced electroactive area on the working electrode. © 2019 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={‘Curse of Dimensionality’—massive generation of high-dimensional medical datasets from various biomedical applications hardens the data analytic process for precise medical diagnosis. The design of an efficient feature selection technique for finding the optimal feature subset can be devised as a prominent solution to the above-said challenge. Further, it also improves the accuracy and minimizes the computational complexity of the learning model. The state-of-the-art feature selection techniques based on heuristic and statistical functions suffer from significant challenges in terms of classification accuracy, time complexity, etc. Hence, this paper presents Rough Set Theory and Hypergraph (RSHGT)-based feature selection technique to identify the optimal feature subset for accurate medical diagnosis.

abstract={Hyperglycaemia during pregnancy is the main reason for developing diabetes mediated vascular complications. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are formed due to non-enzymatic glycation of proteins, lipids and nucleic acids during hyperglycaemia. It has the potential to damage vasculature by modifying the substrate or by means of AGEs and receptor of AGE (RAGE) interaction. It has been linked with the pathogenesis of various vascular diseases including coronary heart disease, atherosclerosis, restenosis etc. This study was carried out to investigate the role of AGEs-EGR-1 pathway in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) vascular inflammation. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HuVECs) isolated from normal glucose tolerant mothers were subjected to various treatments including high glucose, silencing of early growth response (EGR)-1, blockade of protein kinase C (PKC) β, blocking extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), and treatment with AGEs and assayed for EGR-1, tissue factor (TF) and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule (sICAM)-1. Similarly, umbilical vein endothelial cells isolated from normal and GDM mothers were assayed for EGR-1, TF, and sICAM-1. There was a significant increase in EGR-1 and TF levels in HuVECs isolated form GDM mother’s umbilical cord and normal HuVECs treated with high glucose condition. This was accompanied by elevated levels of sICAM-1 in high glucose treated cells. Our results revealed AGE-mediated activation of EGR-1 and its downstream genes via PKC βII and ERK1/2 signaling pathway. The present study demonstrated a novel mechanism of AGEs/ PKC βII/ ERK1/2/EGR-1 pathway in inducing vascular inflammation in GDM. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The cellular manufacturing technology, an application of group technology in manufacturing, has been a widely studied combinatorial optimization problem where the entire production system is divided into many cells and part families. In this paper, a novel clonal selection algorithm (CSA) that uses a new affinity function and part assignment heuristic for solving a multi-objective cell formation problem is studied. The proposed CSA has been hybridized with genetic algorithm for generating feasible cell sequences that fulfill both mutual exhaustivity and exclusion properties of machine cells prior to the initial population generation. Additionally, a new part assignment heuristic function that maps parts to machine cells and a novel basic affinity function have been built into the proposed CSA so that it can act as the utility function to solve the multi-objective cell formation problem. This hybrid CSA (HCSA) has been presented and computational results have been obtained for the proposed scheme with a set of 52 benchmark instances collected from literature. The results presented herein demonstrate that overall proposed HCSA is much more promising in comparison with existing approaches available in recent literatures. Extensive statistical and convergence tests have been carried out to ratify the superiority of the proposed HCSA. The improvements can be attributed to the collaborative interactions in the CSA mechanism, the proposed hybridization for initial population generation and so forth. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={With trending competition in decision-making process, linguistic decision-making is gaining attractive attention. Previous studies on linguistic decision-making have neglected the occurring probability (relative importance) of each linguistic term which causes unreasonable ranking of objects. Further, decision-makers' (DMs) often face difficulties in providing apt preference information for evaluation. Motivated by these challenges, in this paper, we set our proposal on probabilistic linguistic preference relation (PLPR)-based decision framework. The framework consists of two phases viz., (a) missing value entry phase and (b) ranking phase. In phase (a), the missing values of PLPR are filled using a newly proposed automatic procedure and consistency of PLPR is ensured using a consistency check and repair mechanism. Following this, in phase (b), objects are ranked using newly proposed analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method under PLPR context. The practicality of the proposal is validated by using two numerical examples viz., green supplier selection problem for healthcare and the automobile industry. Finally, the strength and weakness of the proposal are discussed by comparing with similar methods. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={The existence of a multitude of cloud service providers (CSPs) for each service type increases the difficulty in the identification of appropriate and trustworthy service providers based on their abilities and cloud users’ unique functional and non-functional quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. Further, the dynamic nature of the cloud ecosystem in terms of performance and new services increases the complexity of the cloud service selection problem. Trust-based service selection mechanisms which involve the intrinsic relations among the QoS parameters or trust measure parameters (TMPs) to evaluate the quality of the CSPs are the most preferred solution for the problem of cloud service selection. However, the accuracy of the trust-based service selection models and the CSP’s trust value relies on the optimality of the TMP subset obtained with respect to the service type. Hence, this work presents an efficient rough set theory-based hypergraph-binary fruit fly optimization (RST-HGBFFO), a cooperative bio-inspired technique to identify the optimal service-specific TMPs. Experiments on QWS dataset, Cloud Armor, and CISH—SASTRA trust feedback dataset reveal the predominance of RST-HGBFFO over the state-of-the-art feature selection techniques. The performance of RST-HGBFFO feature selection technique was validated using hypergraph-based computational model and WEKA tool in terms of reduct size, service ranking, classification accuracy, and time complexity. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={This paper presents a prototype to classify stroke that combines text mining tools and machine learning algorithms. Machine learning can be portrayed as a significant tracker in areas like surveillance, medicine, data management with the aid of suitably trained machine learning algorithms. Data mining techniques applied in this work give an overall review about the tracking of information with respect to semantic as well as syntactic perspectives. The proposed idea is to mine patients’ symptoms from the case sheets and train the system with the acquired data. In the data collection phase, the case sheets of 507 patients were collected from Sugam Multispecialty Hospital, Kumbakonam, Tamil Nadu, India. Next, the case sheets were mined using tagging and maximum entropy methodologies, and the proposed stemmer extracts the common and unique set of attributes to classify the strokes. Then, the processed data were fed into various machine learning algorithms such as artificial neural networks, support vector machine, boosting and bagging and random forests. Among these algorithms, artificial neural networks trained with a stochastic gradient descent algorithm outperformed the other algorithms with a higher classification accuracy of 95% and a smaller standard deviation of 14.69. © 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Background: Fungal keratitis is a major cause of corneal blindness accounting for more than one-third of microbiologically proven cases. The management of fungal keratitis is through topical or systemic antifungal medications alone or in combination with surgical treatment. Topical medications such as natamycin and voriconazole pose major challenges due to poor penetration across the corneal epithelium. To address the issue various carrier molecules like nanoparticles, lipid vesicles, and cell penetrating peptides were explored. But the major drawback such as non-specificity and lack of bioavailability remains. Purpose: In this study, we have attempted to design corneal specific cell penetrating peptide using subtractive proteomic approach from the published literature and tried to improve its bioavailability through gelatin hydrogel delivery system. Material and Methods: Using subtractive proteomic approach two peptides VRF005 and VRF007 were identified on the basis of solubility, cell permeability and amphipathicity. The peptides were modeled for three-dimensional structure and simulated for membrane penetration. The peptides were characterized using circular dichroism spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering and native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Further uptake studies were performed on primary corneal epithelial cells and the stability was analyzed in corneal epithelial tissue lysates. Insilico prediction of peptides showed it to have antifungal activity which was further validated using colony forming assay and time killing kinetics. The duration of antifungal activity of peptide was improved using gelatin hydrogel through sustained delivery. Results: VRF005 and VRF007 showed α-helical structure and was within the allowed region of Ramachandran plot. The simulation study showed their membrane penetration. The peptide uptake was found to be specific to corneal epithelial cells and also showed intracellular localization in Candida albicans and Fusarium solani. Peptides were found to be stable up to 2 hours when incubated with corneal epithelial tissue lysate. Dynamic light scattering, and native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed aggregation of peptides. VRF007 showed antifungal activity up to 24 hour whereas VRF005 showed activity up to 4 hours. Hence gelatin hydrogel-based delivery system was used to improve the activity. Actin staining of corneal epithelial cells showed that the cells were attached on gelatin hydrogel. Conclusion: We have designed corneal specific cell penetrating peptides using subtractive proteomic approach. Bioavailability and delivery of peptide was enhanced using gelatin hydrogel system. © 2019 Amit et al.},

First, colours within a lesion provide the most useful measures for melanoma detection; second, the disorder in colour variety and arrangement provides the best assessment of melanoma colours. These observations lead to the hypothesis that colour disorder is best measured by entropy.

abstract={Background The key visual factors in a classroom environment include the legibility, angle subtended at the eye, illumination, contrast, and colour of the visual task. The study evaluated the visual environmental factors in the school classrooms. Materials and methods The distance Visual Acuity (VA) demand was evaluated based on the size of visual task i.e. the smallest size of chalkboard writing and its viewing distance. The environmental factors which can have an effect on the visibility in classrooms such as illuminance on the chalkboard and at student’s desk, chalkboard contrast, light sources and the student’s perception of their classroom visual environment were measured. To quantify the distance VA demand and to compare with a standard high contrast VA chart measure, a validation of the measurements was performed by chalkboard simulation experiment. The “acuity reserve” to be included to the measured distance VA demand was evaluated. Results We included twenty-nine classrooms of eight schools. The median distance VA threshold demand was 0.28 logMAR(0.25,0.45). The median illuminance on front desk position and chalkboard contrast was 130 lux(92,208) and 40(36,50) respectively with 62% classrooms having low illumination (<150lux). The acuity reserve evaluated to be included to the distance VA demand was 0.13logMAR and 0.29 logMAR in classrooms with optimal and low chalkboard illumination respectively which was based on the results of the simulation experiment. The median distance VA demand including the acuity reserve was 0.09 logMAR (-0.03,0.23) [Snellen Equivalent: 20/25(20/19,20/34)]. Conclusion The study findings highlight the increased visual task demand in school classrooms and the need for appropriate seating arrangements in classrooms based on the visual acuity of children. The study emphasises regular audit of the classroom environment along with the school eye screening. © 2019 Negiloni et al.

abstract={Web pages are heterogeneous and complex and there exists complicated associations within one web pages and linking to the others. The high interactions between terms in pages demonstrate vague and ambiguous meanings. Efficient and effective clustering methods are needed to discover latent and coherent meanings in context are necessary. This paper proposes an efficient clustering approach for fair semantic web content retrieval based on tri-level ontology construction model with hybrid dragonfly algorithm. Initially the query processing phase, by making use of systematic adaptive hierarchy method (SAHM) efficient ontology selection process is carried out by means of matching keywords retrieved form user query. Secondly, fuzzy sensitive near-neighbour influence (FSNI) based clustering approach relied on the ontology driven fuzzy linguistic measure, applied to estimate the uncertainty that may be relevant to the semantic content which belongs to the user quires. The proposed FSNI clustering approach with HDA algorithm performance is be evaluated and compared with existing clustering approaches in terms of retrieval accuracy and surfing time.

abstract={The dynamic nature of users’ functional & non-functional requirements and the ever-increasing number of cloud service providers with similar functionalities poses a significant challenge on the identification of trustworthy cloud services. Existing service selection approaches lacks in trust-based evaluation in terms of compliance between the service provision and the user requirements mentioned in the Service Level Agreements (SLAs), which results in inconsistent ranking of Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) due to the rank reversal phenomenon. As a solution to the rank reversal problem, this paper presents Grey CRiteria Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation Parallel Analysis (GCRITICPA) based service ranking approach that employs CRITICA to determine weights of the criteria Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) to rank the trustworthy cloud service providers. A case study using real world Cloud Armor trust feedback dataset demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed approach in terms of trustworthiness and rank preservation. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.},

abstract={To monitor the vibration of blades in rotating machinery, the contactless method called Blade Tip Timing (BTT) is widely used. blade vibration and clearance are important diagnostic features for condition monitoring, including the detection of blade cracks. To perform the BTT technique, optical sensors were widely used by industry due to their high accuracy, but the main drawback of these systems is their low tolerance to the presence of contaminants. To overcome this downside, eddy current sensors are a good alternative for health monitoring applications in gas turbines due to their insensitivity to contaminants and debris. This type of sensor has been used by many researchers, predominantly on the experimental side to investigate BTT systems and there is a lack of modelling to support the measurement system design. This paper fills the gap between experiments and modelling for the particular case of a blade rotating past eddy current sensors. Hence the novelty of this paper is the simulation of the BTT application using detailed quasi-static finite element models of the electro-magnetic field to estimate the outputs from active and passive eddy current sensors. A test rig composed of a bladed disk with 12 blades clamped to a rotating shaft was designed and manufactured in order to validate the proposed models with experimental measurements. Finally, a parametric study is presented to show the effect of the blade tip clearance and the rotational speed on the accuracy of the BTT measurement. This leads to better understanding of the sources of error in the time of arrival of the blades passing the sensor and hence insight into the blade vibration measurement accuracy. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Purpose: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is characterized by pro-inflammatory, pro-angiogenic and pro-fibrotic environment during the various stages of the disease progression. Basement membrane changes in the retina and formation of fibrovascular membrane are characteristically seen in DR. In the present study the effect of Alcoholic (AlE) extracts of Triphala an ayurvedic herbal formulation and its chief compounds, Chebulagic (CA), Chebulinic (CI) and Gallic acid (GA) were evaluated for TGFβ1-induced anti-fibrotic activity in choroid-retinal endothelial cells (RF/6A). Method: RF/6A cells were treated with TGFβ1 alone or co-treated with AlE, CA, CI or GA. The mRNA and protein expression of fibrotic markers (αSMA, CTGF) were assessed by qPCR and western blot/ELISA. Functional changes were assessed using proliferation assay and migration assay. To deduce the mechanism of action, downstream signaling was assessed by western blot analysis along with in silico docking studies. Result: AlE (50 μg/ml) CA and CI at 10 μM reduced the expression of pro-fibrotic genes (αSMA and CTGF) induced by TGFβ1, by inhibiting ERK phosphorylation. GA did not inhibit TGFβ1 mediated changes in RF/6A cells. In silico experiments shows that CA and CI has favourable binding energy to bind with TGFβ receptor and inhibit the downstream signaling, while GA did not. Conclusion: Hence this study identifies Triphala and its chief compounds CA and CI as potential adjuvants in the management of DR. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Obesity is considered as an independent risk factor for breast cancer (BCa) and plays a major role in the breast tumor microenvironment. The etiology and mechanisms by which obesity contributes to BCa development is not yet understood. Herein, we show that in vitro coculture of BCa cells with mature adipocytes (MA-BCa) increased proliferation, migration, and invasive phenotype of BCa cells. MA-BCa coculture led to increased production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. To identify microRNAs (miRNAs) in BCa cells that are modulated by the presence of adipocytes, we used small RNA sequencing analysis. Sequencing data revealed that 98 miRNAs were differentially expressed in MA-BCa. Among them, miR-3184-5p and miR-181c-3p were found to be the most upregulated and downregulated miRNAs, and direct targets are FOXP4 and PPARα, respectively. In vitro functional assays using a combination of miR-3184-5p inhibitor and miR-181c-3p mimic synergistically decreased adipocytes-induced cell proliferation and invasive capacity of BCa cells. Gene Set Enrichment analysis indicated that transcription factors were highly enriched followed by protein kinases, oncogene, and protein regulators in MA-BCa. GeneGo Metacore pathway analysis uncovered “NOTCH-induced EMT pathway” was found to be the most abundant in MA-BCa. Consistently, epithelial–mesenchymal transition-associated markers were also increased in MA-BCa. The disease enrichment analysis of the predict target genes revealed that diabetes mellitus was significantly affected disease in MA-BCa. Taken together, our data suggest that miRNA-based regulatory mechanism associated with deregulation of pathways and biological functions orchestrated by adipocytes-secreted factors might drive the BCa progression and metastasis in obese patients. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={The family of MAX phases and their derivative MXenes are continuously growing in terms of both crystalline and composition varieties. In the last couple of years, several breakthroughs have been achieved that boosted the synthesis of novel MAX phases with ordered double transition metals and, consequently, the synthesis of novel MXenes with a higher chemical diversity and structural complexity, rarely seen in other families of two-dimensional (2D) materials. Considering the various elemental composition possibilities, surface functional tunability, various magnetic orders, and large spin–orbit coupling, MXenes can truly be considered as multifunctional materials that can be used to realize highly correlated phenomena. In addition, owing to their large surface area, hydrophilicity, adsorption ability, and high surface reactivity, MXenes have attracted attention for many applications, e.g., catalysts, ion batteries, gas storage media, and sensors. Given the fast progress of MXene-based science and technology, it is timely to update our current knowledge on various properties and possible applications. Since many theoretical predictions remain to be experimentally proven, here we mainly emphasize the physics and chemistry that can be observed in MXenes and discuss how these properties can be tuned or used for different applications. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

The degradation efficiency of binary catalyst is found to be 91% and 90% for MB and MG dyes, respectively whereas the corresponding values of the ternary catalyst are 99% and 95%, respectively. The reasons for the enhancement in the photocatalytic dye degradation of ternary catalyst are explained with suitable mechanism with the help of various analytical studies such as XRD, PL, FT-IR, SEM, TEM, HRTEM, EDAX, DRS and XPS.

abstract={Functional near-infrared spectroscopy is an optical non-invasive technique for measurement of neural activity and hemodynamic response and has a potential for brain mapping. In this work, we aimed to develop a system to capture the cranial photoplethysmogram (CPPG) using IR source (860 nm) and detector (OPT 101). AC excitation for the IR source in the range of 1−2 MHz plays a major role in the CPPG sensor. Brain functional activity in prefrontal lobe is detected by placing the sensor on the forehead. The CPPG signal is captured with eyes open (EO) and eye blinking (EB) activity for various emotions (happy and sad) on prefrontal lobe. Data acquisition is done using AVR ATmega 8535 microcontroller at a sampling rate of 500 Hz. The data are acquired from subjects in the age group of 20−60 years. Using Daubechies 9, six-level wavelet decomposition of CPPG signal is performed, and spectral analysis of each level is done using Welch’s method. From the spectral analysis, it is found the centre frequency of A6 is at 1.953 Hz. The higher frequency part of the signal is found in D4 scale and the centre frequency is 17.58 Hz. All other scales D3−D1 show predominantly the noise part of the signal. Statistical features of A6 and D6 decomposition levels are important for analysis and classification of activity. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.},

abstract={In endeavor toward better understanding of brain functions, the analysis of information transfer between the various brain lobes plays a crucial role. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is an electrical brain signal in microvolts, which provides unique and important information about the brain dynamics. Frequency of EEG signal lies between 0 and 100 Hz. In epileptic or seizure related studies, decomposition of EEG signal into various frequency sub-bands such as α, β, δ, θ, and γ is essential. EEG plays a key role in diagnosis of neurological disorders such as epilepsy. In this paper, we explore decomposition of EEG by db18 wavelet, power spectral density, coherence, energy distribution, and empirical cumulative distribution function of EEGs. This work was carried out to study the changes in the normal and epileptic EEGs with respect to PSD, coherence, energy, and ECDF to check the suitability of these parameters as an input to the classifiers. The methodology was applied mainly to three groups consisting of male and females between the age group of 01–107 years: (1) healthy subjects (normal), (2) subjects with focal seizures, (3) subjects with generalized seizures. The work was carried out on the signals obtained from real subjects to study the EEG-based brain connectivity analysis. It was observed that PSD and coherence study related to the sub-bands reveal more accurate information than the study of complete EEG with or without the seizures. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.},

Fog computing has many advantages and it is suited for the applications whereby real-time, high response time, and low latency are of the utmost importance, especially healthcare applications. Objectives: The aim of this study was to present a systematic literature review of the technologies for fog computing in the healthcare IoT systems field and analyze the previous. Providing motivation, limitations faced by researchers, and suggestions proposed to analysts for improving this essential research field. Methods: The investigations were systematically performed on fog computing in the healthcare field by all studies; furthermore, the four databases Web of Science (WoS), ScienceDirect, IEEE Xplore Digital Library, and Scopus from 2007 to 2017 were used to analyze their architecture, applications, and performance evaluation. Results: A total of 99 articles were selected on fog computing in healthcare applications with deferent methods and techniques depending on our inclusion and exclusion criteria. The taxonomy results were divided into three major classes; frameworks and models, systems (implemented or architecture), review and survey. Discussion: Fog computing is considered suitable for the applications that require real-time, low latency, and high response time, especially in healthcare applications. All these studies demonstrate that resource sharing provides low latency, better scalability, distributed processing, better security, fault tolerance, and privacy in order to present better fog infrastructure. Learned lessons: numerous lessons related to fog computing. Fog computing without a doubt decreased latency in contrast to cloud computing. Researchers show that simulation and experimental proportions ensure substantial reductions of latency is provided. Which it is very important for healthcare IoT systems due to real-time requirements. Conclusion: Research domains on fog computing in healthcare applications differ, yet they are equally important for the most parts. We conclude that this review will help accentuating research capabilities and consequently expanding and making extra research domains. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Generally, the Gaussian assumption has been considered in analyzing the data pertaining to the wind effects on the structures or bluff bodies due to the abundance of the statistical information. In this study, Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine (HAWT) tower system with dimension of 1:330 scale is studied in order to understand their peak pressure behavior for wind resistant design. Generally, tower systems are constructed of various geometrical structures such as lattice towers, tubular steel towers, concrete towers, but in this present study tubular cylindrical tower is only considered. Simultaneous pressure measurements on the surface of the tower were performed in the low-speed boundary layer wind tunnel with test section dimension of 18 m × 2.5 m × 2.15 m having Reynolds number ranging from 10 2 to 10 4 . The peak pressures acting on the tower systems are calculated for a number of ten-minute samples on various locations of the wind turbine. Peak value calculations based on Gaussian and Non - Gaussian processes are discussed mathematically and applied to the data collected from the wind tunnel tests. A mathematical model of Davenport and Kareem - Zhou is used in calculating the peak factor for Gaussian and non - Gaussian processes, respectively. The results indicate that higher moments dominate as most of the distribution is skewed and with kurtosis value. Henceforth, a study on extreme value analysis is deemed necessary in designing wind resistant structures or bluff bodies. Considering Gaussian nature alone may under-represent the peak value of the HAWT tower. © 2019 Isfahan University of Technology.},

abstract={Brain-computer interface (BCI) connects the outside world, in real time and in a natural way, like biological communication system. It facilitates the communication link from the brain to the external world by converting brain thoughts in to control commands to control the external devices, such as wheelchair, keyboard mouse, and other home appliances. Measuring the electrical brain activity by placing electrodes over scalp is called electroencephalogram (EEG). By combining these two techniques, we are able to create EEG-based BCI. In this paper, we use band power and radial basis function to analyze the signal for four mentally composed tasks to design four states BCI for a neurodegenerative person using EEG. Online study was conducted to analyze the performance of the wheelchair for a neurodegenerative person. The result shows that an overall average classification accuracy of 92.50% and individual tasks with an average classification of 95%, 87.50%, 92.50%, and 95.00% were achieved for the four tasks. The result proves that control commands generated from the EEG signal have the bcapacity to control the intelligent systems. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Recommender systems have been based on context and content, and now the technological challenge of making personalized recommendations based on the user emotional state arises through physiological signals that are obtained from devices or sensors. This paper applies the deep learning approach using a deep convolutional neural network on a dataset of physiological signals (electrocardiogram and galvanic skin response), in this case, the AMIGOS dataset. The detection of emotions is done by correlating these physiological signals with the data of arousal and valence of this dataset, to classify the affective state of a person. In addition, an application for emotion recognition based on classic machine learning algorithms is proposed to extract the features of physiological signals in the domain of time, frequency, and non-linear. This application uses a convolutional neural network for the automatic feature extraction of the physiological signals, and through fully connected network layers, the emotion prediction is made. The experimental results on the AMIGOS dataset show that the method proposed in this paper achieves a better precision of the classification of the emotional states, in comparison with the originally obtained by the authors of this dataset. © 2013 IEEE.},

Injectable hydrogel based strategies offer a wide range of applications in rapid recovery of bone defects by acting as filler materials and depots for delivering various bioactive molecules and averting the need for surgical intervention. Chitosan (CS), a natural polysaccharide, forms a thermosensitive injectable hydrogel through the addition of beta-glycerophosphate (β-GP). This hybrid hydrogel possesses numerous advantages namely mimicking native extracellular matrix (ECM) and providing an amenable microenvironment for cell growth. In this review, a brief insight into the gelation mechanism of CS/GP hydrogels, modifications, bioactive additives and their applications in treating bone defects are presented. © 2018},

abstract={Intracellular delivery of nucleic acids is one of the critical steps in the transfections. Prior findings demonstrated various strategies including membrane fusion, endosomal escape for the efficient cytoplasmic delivery. In our continuing efforts to improve the nucleic acids transfections, we harnessed cell permeable properties of Tomatidine (T), a steroidal alkaloid abundantly found in green tomatoes for maximizing intracellular delivery of lipoplexes. We doped Tomatidine into liposomes of cationic lipid with amide linker (A) from our lipid library. Six liposomal formulations (AT) of Lipid A (1 mM) with varying concentrations of Tomatidine (0–1 mM) were prepared and evaluated for their transfection efficacies. Owing to its signature characteristic of cell membrane permeability, Tomatidine modulated endocytosis process, enhanced the intracellular delivery of the lipoplexes, and in turn increased the transfection efficacy of cationic liposomes. Our findings provide ‘proof of concept’ for enhancing transfections in gene delivery applications with Tomatidine in cationic liposomal formulations. These findings can be further applied in lipid mediated gene therapy and drug delivery applications. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={High-performance energy storage devices are extremely useful in sustainable transportation systems. Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and supercapacitors (SCs) are well-known energy storage technologies due to their exceptional role in consumer electronics and grid energy storage. However, in the present state of the art, both devices are inadequate for many applications such as hybrid electric vehicles and so on. Lithium-ion capacitors (LICs) are combinations of LIBs and SCs which phenomenally improve the performance by bridging the gap between these two devices. In this review, we first introduce the concept of LICs, criteria for materials selection and recent trends in the anode and cathode materials development. Then, the achievements and prospects associated with LICs are discussed. Finally, we give our recommendations on fabricating anode with hybrid and nanostructured form and cathode with improved capacitive performance. © 2019},

abstract={Dithering is used regularly for printing monochrome images. Newspaper photographs are dithered for example. In the monochrome images, each pixel is stored as a single bit. The smallest unit of the digital image is a pixel, i.e., the picture element. The bits-per-pixel is the significant metric to the appearance level of the nature of the image. To obtain the diverse gray shades, different patterns of white and black dots are used. This paper deals with the underlying fundamental behind the dithering with medical test images. The techniques such as quantization, dithered, dithered and quantized, dithered and quantized with subtraction, and the adoption of filtering kernel are implemented. The performance of each one is evaluated with mean-square-error and peak signal-to-noise ratio metrics. Three medical test images such as one mammogram image, one angiogram image, and one thermal image are used in this paper.

abstract={Background Currently, patients receiving vascularized composite allotransplantation (VCA) grafts must take long-term systemic immunosuppressive therapy to prevent immunologic rejection. The morbidity and mortality associated with these medications is the single greatest barrier to more patients being able to receive these life-enhancing transplants. In contrast to solid organs, VCA, exemplified by hand or face transplants, allow visual diagnosis of clinical acute rejection (AR), directed biopsy and targeted graft therapies. Local immunosuppression in VCA could reduce systemic drug exposure and limit adverse effects. This proof of concept study evaluated, in a large animal forelimb VCA model, the efficacy and tolerability of a novel graft-implanted enzyme-responsive, tacrolimus (TAC)—eluting hydrogel platform, in achieving long-term graft survival. Methods Orthotopic forelimb VCA were performed in single haplotype mismatched mini-swine. Controls (n = 2) received no treatment. Two groups received TAC hydrogel: high dose (n = 4, 91 mg TAC) and low dose (n = 4, 49 mg TAC). The goal was to find a dose that was tolerable and resulted in long-term graft survival. Limbs were evaluated for clinical and histopathological signs of AR. TAC levels were measured in serial blood and skin tissue samples. Tolerability of the dose was evaluated by monitoring animal feeding behavior and weight. Results Control limbs underwent Banff Grade IV AR by post-operative day six. Low dose TAC hydrogel treatment resulted in long-term graft survival time to onset of Grade IV AR ranging from 56 days to 93 days. High dose TAC hydrogel also resulted in long-term graft survival (24 to 42 days), but was not well tolerated. Conclusion Graft-implanted TAC-loaded hydrogel delays the onset of Grade IV AR of mismatched porcine forelimb VCA grafts, resulting in long term graft survival and demonstrates dose-dependent tolerability.

abstract={We report the interaction of stanane nanosheet (Sn-NS) with deoxy ribo nucleic acids (DNA)/ribo nucleic acids (RNA) utilizing density functional theory (DFT) technique. The calculated formation energy led us to conclude that Sn-NS exhibits a stable geometric structure. The energy band structure and density of states (DOS) spectrum provide the electronic characteristics of Sn-NS, and the band gap is found to be 1.73 eV, which exhibit semiconducting property. Our results confirmed the adsorption of nucleobases with stanane nanosheet, which follows the sequence C > U > A > T > G. The interaction property of nucleobases on Sn-NS material is authenticated with the Bader charge transfer, energy gap, adsorption energy and average energy gap changes. Moreover, the interaction of nucleobases on Sn-NS is also explored using the change in the DOS-spectrum, electron density diagrams and energy band structure. The findings of the current work infer that the DNA sequencing can be carried out using stanane nanosheet. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

Four entropy segmentation methods are based on Tsallis, Havrda and Charvat, Renyi, and Kapur entropy measures. Fifth method is based on merging these four segmented image on the ascending order of threshold. By this the merged image helps to vision internal border on the lesion region for dermatologist. These methods are inspired by two clinical observations about melanoma. First, colours within a lesion provide the most useful measures for melanoma detection; second, the disorder in colour variety and arrangement, provides the best assessment of melanoma colours. These observations lead to the hypothesis that colour disorder is best measured by entropy. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Soil stabilization is an essential engineering process to enhance the geotechnical properties of soils that are not suitable for construction purposes. This study focuses on using coconut coir, a natural fibre to enhance the soil properties. Lime, an activator is added to the reinforced soil to augment its shear strength and durability. An experimental investigation was conducted to demonstrate the effect of coconut coir fibers and lime on the consistency limits, compaction characteristics, unconfined compressive strength, stress-strain behaviour, subgrade strength and durability of the treated soil. The results of the study illustrate that lime stabilization and coir reinforcement improves the unconfined compressive strength, post peak failure strength, controls crack propagation and boosts the tensile strength of the soil. Coir reinforcement provides addition contact surface, improving the soil-fibre interaction and increasing the interlocking between fibre and soil and thereby improve strength. Optimum performance of soil is observed at 1.25% coir fibre inclusion. Coir being a natural product is prone to degradation and to increase the durability of the coir reinforced soil, lime is used. Lime stabilization favourably amends the geotechnical properties of the coir fibre reinforced soil. © 2018 Techno-Press, Ltd.},

abstract={Nanotechnology-based interventions have gained popularity in the past decade for cancer therapy owing to their ability to overcome several shortcomings encountered in conventional therapy. Among the various nanoparticles that have been explored as drug carriers, mesoporous silica possesses certain desirable properties such as regulated pore size, high surface area, chemical and thermal stability, amenability for surface modification and biocompatibility. These systems have been widely investigated for site-specific delivery of single and multiple therapeutic agents as well as for imaging and theranostic applications. In recent times, the concept of targeted and sustained delivery of the therapeutic agent has transformed into a more attractive and effective approach of triggered drug release thereby ushering in an era of ‘on-demand’ drug delivery. Mesoporous silica due to its tunable surface functionalities has emerged in the forefront of triggered release systems. Though different types of external stimuli have been extensively investigated to bring about triggered drug release from mesoporous silica, chemo-responsive systems offer more therapeutic effectiveness with minimal collateral damage commonly associated with external stimuli. Chemo-responsiveness is generally achieved by introducing an appropriate gate-keeper molecule at the pore surface that regulates the diffusion of the drug molecules. This review analyzes different strategies that have been attempted to achieve ‘on-demand’ drug release in mesoporous silica carriers in response to various types of chemical stimuli. Emerging trends in the field of chemo-responsive mesoporous silica are also presented in this review. © 2018},

abstract={Insight into the controlled growth features of nanowires has been in the prominent spotlight for engineering the material properties. Defect and dislocation induced nanowire growth has been emerging as a robust model by dwindling the conventional growth models. In this context, we have proposed a screw dislocated Eshelby twist origin in cationic assimilated ZnO nanowires synthesized via Successive Ionic Layer Absorption and Reaction (SILAR) technique. The growth of twisted nanowires occurred through a subsequent transformation from nanoflakes to nanoflowers. Presence of twist contours in various zone axis pattern provided strong validation of Eshelby origin in twisted nanowires. The preferential plane orientation of (0 0 0 2) confirmed the twisted growth along c-axis orientation. Presence of screw tail at the twisted end of nanowire confirmed the influence of Peach-Kohler force acted on the screw axis. Active vibrational modes and surface defect states of nanoflowers and nanowires were investigated and reported. Twisted ZnO nanowires showed maximum sensing response of 291 towards 100 ppm of ammonia at room temperature with the lowest detection limit of 5 ppm. The response and recovery times were found to be 39 and 17 s. Influence of grain alignment, grain orientation and potential barrier height on ammonia sensing signatures are reported. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={BMI-1 (B-lymphoma Mo-MLV insertion region 1) is a key protein partner in polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) that helps in maintaining the integrity of the complex. It is also a key player in ubiquitination of histone H2A which affects gene expression pattern involved in various cellular processes such as cell proliferation, growth, DNA repair, apoptosis and senescence. In many cancers, Overexpression of BMI1correlates with advanced stages of disease, aggressive clinicopathological behavior, poor prognosis resistance to radiation and chemotherapy. BMI1 is emerging as a key player in EMT, chemo-resistance and cancer stemness. Overexpression is observed in various cancer types such as breast, primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), gastric, ovarian, head and neck, pancreatic and lung cancer. Studies have shown that experimental reduction of BMI protein level in tumor cells results in inhibition of cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis and/or senescence, and increases susceptibility to cytotoxic agents and radiation therapy. Thus, inhibition of BMI1 expression particularly in breast cancer stem cells can be used as a potential strategy for the complete elimination of tumor and to prevent disease relapse. On other hand PTEN is known to be an important tumor suppressor next to p53. In many cancers particularly in breast cancer, p53 and PTEN undergo mutations. Studies have indicated the functional and mechanistic link between the BMI-1oncoprotein and tumor suppressor PTEN in the development and progression of cancer. The current review focuses on recent findings of how oncogenicity and chemo-resistance are caused by BMI1. It also highlights the transcriptional regulation between BMI1 and PTEN that dictates the therapeutic outcome in cancers where the functional p53 is absent. Herein, we have clearly demonstrated the regulation of transcription at genomic loci of BMI1 and PTEN in cancerous tissue or cells and the possible epigenetic regulation by histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) at BMI1 and PTEN loci that may provide some clue for the possible therapy against TNBC in near future. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This work presents the modules for enhancing the security of speaker authentication by embedding the watermark in a speech signal. Speaker is authenticated by speech as well as the extracted watermark from the watermarked speech. Firstly, the speech signal is converted into frames, and discrete wavelet transform is applied to each frame, and it is preferable to embed the watermark in detail coefficients. The segment for embedding the watermark is appropriately chosen based on the energy calculations. The approximation and the modified detail coefficients are used to generate the watermarked speech by inverse discrete wavelet transform. Imperceptibility of the watermark in a watermarked speech is purely depending on the embedding of the watermark. In the receiver, the watermarked speech will undergo wavelet decomposition, and the watermark bits are extracted from the detail coefficients and appropriately transformed into watermark speech/image. The performance the work is evaluated by using the metrics such as Peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) between original watermark and extracted watermark, PSNR between original speech and watermarked speech and Bit error rate (BER) and Perceptual evaluation speech quality (PESQ). Speaker identification system is assessed by using extraction of the perceptual features and application of features to develop the models for the set of utterances about the speaker during the training phase of the work. Testing is done by applying the original and watermarked speech utterances to the feature extraction phase, followed by we have the testing phase which is used for computing the accuracy. Accuracy is 98.2% for the speaker identification with the set of original test utterances and 98.1% with watermarked set of test utterances and it is observed that there is the marginal difference in accuracy for using speech as a watermark. It is 97.85% for using the image as a watermark. Cover speech signals and watermark speech used in our work are continuous speech utterances chosen from “TIMIT” speech database. Image watermark is the Quick response (QR) code for the LOGO. This work also emphasizes the effectiveness of the algorithm in providing robustness for copyright protection to ownership of the data and authenticating persons using speech as a biometric. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={In digital systems design, the high-speed adders play an imperative role in modules like adders, multipliers, division, etc. to obtain the results quickly. In digital signal processor and computer data path circuits, carry look-ahead adder (CLA), carry save adder (CSA), carry select adder (CSeA) and carry skip adder are the mostly used fast adders to improve the performance of a system. This work mainly emphasizes on fault-tolerant carry save adder using hardware redundancy configurations for the betterment of reliability at the cost of area. The popular methods like dual (DMR) and triple modular redundancy (TMR) are implemented to detect only but not correct an error and tolerate single event upset (SEU) error respectively. To tolerate multiple errors, for example, two, three and four errors, the 5-modular (quintuple), 7-modular (septuple), and 9-modular (nonuple) redundancy configurations are used respectively. For experimental results, the implementation of a simple addition of four 4-bit numbers is considered on Altera FPGA EP4CE115F29C7 device using Quartus II synthesis software tool. Simulation results reveal that for example in nonuple MR, CSA using CSeA final stage obtain higher performance (45.7 MHz) with moderate power dissipation as 173.36 mW and at the cost of more LEs (216). © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Different compositions of trimetallic alloy containing silver, copper, and nickel (AgxCuyNiz) were electrodecorated in a protic ionic liquid medium on glassy carbon electrodes in order to investigate the suitability of the materials as catalysts for electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2). Surface characteristic morphology obtained by scanning electron microscopy shows cauliflower crystallites for the deposit of Ag, whereas materials of Cu and Ni exhibit cubic grains and fine particles, respectively. Deposits of trimetallic alloy containing Ag, Cu, and Ni exhibit the mixture of the three characteristic features. Further, trimetallic alloy containing a large amount of Ag provides high crystallinity, whereas predominance of Cu as well as Ni results in porous structures, as revealed by X-ray diffraction analysis. Atomic absorption spectroscopy () was used to determine the compositions of different alloy materials. The suitability of nanomaterials as cathodes for electroreduction of benzyl bromide in CO2 containing 0.1 M tetra-n-butylammonium tetrafluoroborate (DMF/TBABF4)/N,N-dimethylformamide medium was explored. The linear sweep voltammogram reveals that Ag46Cu40Ni14 shows higher cathodic peak current and lower cathodic peak potential than those of other deposited nanomaterials as well as alloys, indicating its higher catalytic activity for such an electroreduction process, whereas potentiostatic electrolysis confirms the abovementioned results. © 2018 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Ikshusterol3-O-glucoside was isolated from Clematis gouriana Roxb. ex DC. root. A structure of the isolated compound was determined on the basis of various spectroscopic interpretations (UV, NMR, FTIR, and GC-MS-EI). This structure was submitted in the PubChem compound database (SID 249494133). SID 249494133 was carried out by density functional theory calculation to observe the chemical stability and electrostatic potential of this compound. The absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion property of this compound was predicted to evaluate the drug likeness and toxicity. In addition, molecular docking, quantum polarized ligand docking, prime MMGBSA calculation, and induced fit docking were performed to predict the binding status of SID 249494133 with the active site of phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2 ) (PDB ID: 1A3D). The stability of the compound in the active site of PLA 2 was carried out using molecular dynamics simulation. Further, the anti-venom activity of the compound was assessed using the PLA 2 assay against Naja naja (Indian cobra) crude venom. The results strongly show that Ikshusterol3-O-glucoside has a potent snake-venom neutralizing capacity and it might be a potential molecule for the therapeutic treatment for snakebites. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={The three-component reaction between alkyl- or arylamines, β-ketoesters and chalcones in refluxing ethanol containing a catalytic amount of Ce(IV) ammonium nitrate allowed the construction of a large library of highly substituted dihydro-m-terphenyl derivatives containing β-alkylamino- or β-arylamino ester moieties. This process generates three new bonds and one ring and proceeds in high atom economy, having two molecules of water as the only side product. Another domino process, in which the original MCR was telescoped with a subsequent aza Michael/retro-aza Michael sequence, allowed the one-pot preparation of a library of compounds with a N-unsubstituted β-aminoester fragment. Finally, to extend the structural diversity of these libraries, we also examined the aromatization of the central ring of our compounds in the presence of dichlorodicyanoquinone. This reaction sequence did not affect the integrity of a stereogenic center belonging to the amino component. © Copyright 2018 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Chiral Cu-1B generated in situ was used as an efficient catalyst for the synthesis of β-nitroamines in high yield (88%) with excellent enantioselectivity (ee up to 99%) at RT in absence of co-catalyst via asymmetric aza-Henry reaction of various isatin derived N-Boc ketimines with nitromethane. This catalytic system did not work well with other nitroalkanes under the above optimized reaction conditions. To examine this catalytic behaviour, quantum chemical DFT calculations were performed with the nucleophiles (CH2NO2 − and CH3CHNO2 −) for the conversion of 1a to 2a using macrocyclic Cu-1B complex. The DFT calculated results have shown that the reaction with CH2NO2 − is more favourable than the corresponding CH3CHNO2 −. The calculated activation barriers suggest that the reaction with CH2NO2 − is ∼8.0 kcal/mol energetically favoured than CH3CHNO2 −. This catalytic protocol was further used to obtain chiral β-diamines (a building block for pharmaceuticals) at gram scale. In order to elucidate the reaction mechanism of asymmetric aza Henry reaction kinetic experiments were performed with different concentrations of the catalyst Cu-1B, nitromethane and 1g as the representative substrate. The reaction of isatin N-Boc ketimine was first order with respect to the concentration of the catalyst and the nitromethane but did not depend on the initial concentration of the substrate. A possible mechanism for the aza Henry reaction was proposed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Honey bees have a remarkable sense of time and individual honey bee foragers are capable of adjusting their foraging activity with respect to the time of food availability. Although, there is compelling experimental evidence that foraging behavior is guided by the circadian clock, nothing is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms. Here we present for the first time a study that explores whether time-restricted foraging under natural light-dark (LD) condition affects the molecular clock in honey bees. Food was presented in an enclosed flight chamber (12 m × 4 m × 4 m) either for 2 hours in the morning or 2 hours in the afternoon for several consecutive days and daily cycling of the two major clock genes, cryptochrome2 (cry2) and period (per), were analyzed for three different parts of the nervous system involved in feeding-related behaviors: brain, subesophageal ganglion (SEG), and the antennae with olfactory sensory neurons. We found that morning and afternoon trained foragers showed significant phase differences in the cycling of both clock genes in all three tissues. In addition, the phase differences were more pronounced when the feeder was scented with the common plant odor, linalool. Together our findings suggest that foraging time may function as a Zeitgeber that might have the capability to modulate the light entrained molecular clock. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

A suspension was prepared by dispersing CNT (30 minutes of sonication) in Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO) solvent for 0.5 mg/ml. This suspension after vacuum filtration dispersed over PVDF membrane of pore size 0.22µm. Excess DMSO was removed by washing using Ethanol followed by Deionized water. Amine functionalized (-NH2) SWCNTs were purchased and the CNT based polymer composite nanofiltration membranes were fabricated by vacuum filtration method at a uniform loading of 10mg/cm2. The experimental results were used to evaluate the TDS removal efficiency of the fabricated membrane modules. The TDS removal efficiency of all membranes were observed under varied operating conditions viz., varying flow rate (100, 200, 300, and 400 ml/hr) and influent TDS (1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 and 5000 mg/l).

abstract={Video processing has gained a lot of significance because of its applications in various areas of research. This includes monitoring movements in public places for surveillance. Video sequences from various standard datasets such as I2R, CAVIAR and UCSD are often referred for video processing applications and research. Identification of actors as well as the movements in video sequences should be accomplished with the static and dynamic background. The significance of research in video processing lies in identifying the foreground movement of actors and objects in video sequences. Foreground identification can be done with a static or dynamic background. This type of identification becomes complex while detecting the movements in video sequences with a dynamic background. For identification of foreground movement in video sequences with dynamic background, two algorithms are proposed in this article. The algorithms are termed as Frame Difference between Neighboring Frames using Hue, Saturation and Value (FDNF-HSV) and Frame Difference between Neighboring Frames using Greyscale (FDNF-G). With regard to F-measure, recall and precision, the proposed algorithms are evaluated with state-of-art techniques. Results of evaluation show that, the proposed algorithms have shown enhanced performance. Copyright © 2018 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In this article, the tunable capacitance properties of mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride (MGCN) by tailoring its textural properties are reported. MGCN with different textural properties is synthesized by a hard template method using two different templates namely, SBA-15 and KIT-6. The formation of graphitic layers in the as-synthesized samples is confirmed by X-ray diffraction studies and successful replication of morphology and mesoporosity of the templates into the as-synthesized samples is confirmed by microscopic and nitrogen adsorption-desorption studies. The bulk and surface chemical composition of the as-synthesized samples are analyzed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, CHNS/O analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic studies. The specific capacitance values of 322 and 245 F g−1 are obtained at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 for MGCN synthesized using SBA-15 and KIT-6, respectively. Although, MGCN synthesized using SBA-15 (MGCN-SBA-15) exhibits higher specific capacitance than MGCN synthesized using KIT-6 (MGCN-KIT-6), its rate performance is slightly lower than that of MGCN-KIT-6. The higher specific capacitance of MGCN-SBA-15 is attributed to its high surface area, more number of mesopores and large pore volume, whereas the presence of highly ordered mesopores in MGCN-KIT-6 results in higher rate performance. Both MGCN-SBA-15 and MGCN-KIT-6 electrodes demonstrate excellent cycling stability over 15,000 cycles. These results demonstrate that the supercapacitive performances of MGCN can be improved by tailoring its textural properties. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Catharanthus roseus is a commercial source for anti-cancer terpenoid indole alkaloids (TIAs: vincristine and vinblastine). Inherent levels of these TIAs are very low, hence research studies need to focus on enhancing their levels in planta. Since primary metabolism provides precursors for specialized-metabolism, elevating the former can achieve higher amounts of the latter. Cell Wall Invertase (CWIN), a key enzyme in sucrose-metabolism catalyses the breakdown of sucrose into glucose and fructose, which serve as carbon-skeleton for specialized-metabolites. Understanding CWIN regulation could unravel metabolic-engineering approaches towards enhancing the levels of TIAs in planta. Our study is the first to characterize CWIN at gene-expression level in the medicinal plant, C. roseus. The CWINs and their inter-relationship with sucrose and TIA metabolism was studied at gene and metabolite levels. It was found that sucrose-supplementation to C. roseus leaves significantly elevated the monomeric TIAs (vindoline, catharanthine) and their corresponding genes. This was further confirmed in cross-species, wherein Nicotiana benthamiana leaves transiently-overexpressing CrCWIN2 showed significant upregulation of specialized-metabolism genes: NbPAL2, Nb4CL, NbCHS, NbF3H, NbANS, NbHCT and NbG10H. The specialized metabolites- cinnamic acid, coumarin, and fisetin were significantly upregulated. Thus, the present study provides a valuable insight into metabolic-engineering approaches towards augmenting the levels of therapeutic TIAs. © 2018, The Author(s).},

abstract={SWI/SNF (SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable) complexes regulate the gene expression programs by remodeling the nucleosome architecture of the chromatin functional elements. These large multi-component complexes comprise eight or more subunits and are conserved from yeast to human. Noticeably, nuclear actin and actin-related proteins (Arps) are an integral part of these complexes and are known to directly interact with the helicase-SANT-associated (HSA) domain of ATPase subunit. Recently, SWI/SNF subunits are gaining importance because of the prevalence of cancer-causing mutations associated with them. The functional characterization of the mutations in the SWI/SNF subunits is important for understanding their role in tumorigenesis and identifying potential therapeutic strategies. To study the actin-related complex of human SWI/SNF and the cancer-associated mutations interfering Arp assembly with the ATPase subunit, we modelled the structure of the β-actin-BAF53A-HSA complex based on the yeast Arp-HSA complex (PDB ID: 4I6M). Seven deleterious mutations in the HSA domain of BRG1 were identified based on the functional screening of cancer-associated mutations in the COSMIC database. Detailed structural analysis of the six mutations (R466H, R469W, Y489C, K502N, R513Q and R521P) based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations reveal the distinct effect of each mutation in destabilizing the structure of the Arp-HSA complex. Predominantly we could notice the long-range effect of the HSA mutations in influencing the dynamics of the Arp subunits. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Trustworthiness is a comprehensive quality metric which is used to assess the quality of the services in service-oriented environments. However, trust prediction of cloud services based on the multi-faceted Quality of Service (QoS) attributes is a challenging task due to the complicated and non-linear relationships between the QoS values and the corresponding trust result. Recent research works reveal the significance of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and its variants in providing a reasonable degree of success in trust prediction problems. However, the challenges with respect to weight assignment, training time and kernel functions make ANN and its variants under continuous advancements. Hence, this work presents a novel multi-level Hypergraph Coarsening based Robust Heteroscedastic Probabilistic Neural Network (HC-RHRPNN) to predict trustworthiness of cloud services to build high-quality service applications. HC-RHRPNN employs hypergraph coarsening to identify the informative samples, which were then used to train HRPNN to improve its prediction accuracy and minimize the runtime. The performance of HC-RHRPNN was evaluated using Quality of Web Service (QWS) dataset, a public QoS dataset in terms of classifier accuracy, precision, recall, and F-Score. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

Magnesium-lined paraffin wax present in hybrid nanofluids underwent solid-liquid/liquid-solid transition between 45 °C and 62 °C during which thermal energy was absorbed/released, thereby increasing hybrid nanofluids’ specific heat. The presence of magnesium oxide contributed to thermal conductivity enhancement of hybrid nanofluids, with a maximum of 20% for the one containing 2 vol% nanostructured magnesium oxide, attributable predominantly to the aggregation of primary nanoparticles as flower-like structure.

abstract={Increasing studies have implicated superfluous production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as a significant factor in the progress of neurodegenerative disorders ranging from ischemic stroke to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The possible mechanisms relating to oxidative stress and neurodegeneration are yet to be thoroughly understood. Rutin, a flavonoid, has been well documented for its beneficial and pharmacological activities against diverse targets. However, the mechanism involved in the beneficial effects of rutin against neurodegeneration still remains unclear. Our study investigates the concentration switch effects of rutin on differentiated human neuroblastoma cells (IMR32) in vitro to unveil the possible mechanism of its action. IMR32 cells were differentiated using retinoic acid and challenged with different doses of rutin for 24 h duration to study the influence of ROS on differentiated neuronal cells and ROS-mediated apoptosis. The study showed that the high (100 μM) and low (100 nM and 10μM) rutin concentrations significantly avert ROS generation by two different mechanisms, by enhancing apoptosis through the modulation of levels of Bcl2, Caspase-3, survivin and its antioxidant activity via stress-related proteins, JNK and p38 MAPK. Our study suggests that rutin is a multi-targeted therapeutic and preventive agent that may act as an adjuvant complementary therapeutic molecule to treat oxidative stress-mediated neurodegeneration. © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS},

Marine bacteria isolated from oligotrophic conditions could be taxonomically distinct, metabolically unique, and offers a wide variety of biochemicals. In the present investigation, marine sediments were screened for the potential bacteria that can produce trypsin inhibitors. A moderate halotolerant novel marine bacterial strain of Oceanimonas sp. BPMS22 was isolated, identified, and characterized. The effect of various process parameters like salt concentration, temperature, and pH was studied on the growth of the bacteria and production of trypsin inhibitor. Further, the trypsin inhibitor was purified to near homogeneity using anion exchange, size exclusion, and affinity chromatography. The purified trypsin inhibitor was found to competitively inhibit trypsin activity with an inhibition coefficient, Ki, of 3.44 ± 0.13 μM and second-order association rate constant, kass, of 1.08 × 103 M−1 S−1. The proteinaceous trypsin inhibitor had a molecular weight of approximately 30 kDa.

abstract={With the increasing developments in communication technologies, there is a need for extremely robust information exchange, which is the core aim of steganography. Steganography conceals this information into a trusted media, i.e., an image, video, or audio file, thereby masking its existence. In this paper, to improve the security of implanted data, a steganographic method is proposed that uses contours and clustering. Instead of using the entire image for embedding, the proposed method embeds the data in a particular location of the image that is obtained using a contour. Similar pixels inside the contour are grouped into clusters using the K-means clustering algorithm. Least-significant bit substitution is used to embed the data in the pixels of the cluster without causing any artifacts in the image. The experimental results indicate that our proposed scheme enhances security without degrading the image quality. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The role of Melatonin in influencing diverse genes in plants has gained momentum in recent years and many reports have employed qRT-PCR for their quantification. Relative quantification of gene expression relies on accurate normalization of qRT-PCR data against a stably-expressing internal reference-gene. Although researchers have been using commonly available reference-genes to assess Melatonin-induced gene expression, but to-date, there have been no attempts to validate the reference-gene stability under Melatonin-supplementation in planta. In this study, we performed stability assessment of common reference-genes under Melatonin-supplementation and abiotic stress in leaves and seedlings of Catharanthus roseus using geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, ΔCt and RefFinder algorithms. Nine candidate reference-genes were tested for stability in C. roseus (FBOX, CACS, TIP, RSP9, EXP, EXPR, SAND, F17M5, ACT) and our study inferred that while EXP and EXPR were the most-stable, F17M5 was the lowest-stable gene in the leaf-fed samples. Among seedlings of C. roseus, F17M5 and TIP were the most, while ACT was the least-stable gene. The suitability of selected stable reference-gene pairs was demonstrated by assessing the transcript levels of the Melatonin-biosynthesis gene SNAT under same conditions. Our study is the first to comprehensively analyze the stability of commonly-used reference-genes under Melatonin-induced conditions in C. roseus. © 2018 The Author(s).},

The objective function is framed to minimize power loss and to maximize voltage stability. To search for the optimal location of shunt capacitors, the combinatorial use of loss sensitivity factor and hybrid HSA-PABC algorithm is utilized. In this paper, different types of voltage dependent load models are taken into consideration to investigate their influence on the active power loss and voltage stability of the RDN. Simulation results shows that the voltage dependent load models lead to completely different solutions interms of power loss reduction, voltage stability improvement and net annual savings which are the crucial parameters in the decision process of optimal shunt capacitor placement problem.

abstract={The advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies has revolutionized the world of genomic research. Millions of sequences are generated in a short period of time and they provide intriguing insights to the researcher. Many NGS platforms have evolved over a period of time and their efficiency has been ever increasing. Still, primarily because of the chemistry, glitch in the sequencing machine and human handling errors, some artifacts tend to exist in the final sequence data set. These sequence errors have a profound impact on the downstream analyses and may provide misleading information. Hence, filtering of these erroneous reads has become inevitable and myriad of tools are available for this purpose. However, many of them are accessible as a command line interface that requires the user to enter each command manually. Here, we report EasyQC, a tool for NGS data quality control (QC) with a graphical user interface providing options to carry out trimming of NGS reads based on quality, length, homopolymer, and ambiguous bases. EasyQC also possesses features such as format converter, paired end merger, adapter trimmer, and a graph generator that generates quality distribution, length distribution, GC content, and base composition graphs. Comparison of raw and processed sequence data sets using EasyQC suggested significant increase in overall quality of the sequences. Testing of EasyQC using NGS data sets on a standalone desktop proved to be relatively faster. EasyQC is developed using PERL modules and can be executed in Windows and Linux platforms. With the various QC features, easy interface for end users, and cross-platform compatibility, EasyQC would be a valuable addition to the already existing tools facilitating better downstream analyses. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2018.},

The propeptide domain of LOX (LOX-PP) has been shown to inhibit tumorigenesis in various cancers. In this study, we explored the role of both overexpressed and recombinant LOX-PP in naïve human umbilical vein endothelial cell with the addition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Primarily, we observed a significant reduction in the angiogenesis signaling pathways upon LOX-PP overexpression by proteomic analysis. Further functional analysis showed that the VEGF induced cell proliferation, migration, adhesion and tube formation was inhibited by LOX-PP. Moreover, LOX-PP arrested cells at S-phase, reduced F-actin levels and decreased phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK). The anti-angiogenic effect of LOX-PP was further confirmed by the reduction in the vascular network formation in chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM). These results indicate that inhibition of angiogenesis events is not only achieved by overexpressing LOX-PP but also by addition of rLOX-PP. Taken together our findings discovered the anti-angiogenic role of LOX-PP in endothelial cells which suggests that harnessing this potential can be a promising strategy to inhibit angiogenesis. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={The moisture content of beetroot varies during long-term cold storage. In this work, we propose a strategy to identify the moisture content and age of beetroot using principal component analysis coupled Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Frequent FTIR measurements were recorded directly from the beetroot sample surface over a period of 34 days for analysing its moisture content employing attenuated total reflectance in the spectral ranges of 2614-4000 and 1465-1853 cm -1 with a spectral resolution of 8 cm -1 . In order to estimate the transmittance peak height (T p ) and area under the transmittance curve ({\int }-{{\bar{\nu }}-{i}}{{\bar{\nu }}-{f}}{T}-{p}d\bar{\nu }) (ν i ν f T p d ν ) over the spectral ranges of 2614-4000 and 1465-1853 cm -1 , Gaussian curve fitting algorithm was performed on FTIR data. Principal component and nonlinear regression analyses were utilized for FTIR data analysis. Score plot over the ranges of 2614-4000 and 1465-1853 cm -1 allowed beetroot quality discrimination. Beetroot quality predictive models were developed by employing biphasic dose response function. Validation experiment results confirmed that the accuracy of the beetroot quality predictive model reached 97.5%. This research work proves that FTIR spectroscopy in combination with principal component analysis and beetroot quality predictive models could serve as an effective tool for discriminating moisture content in fresh, half and completely spoiled stages of beetroot samples and for providing status alerts. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={Bacterial resistance is a major clinical problem, which is compounded by both a lack of new antibiotics and emergence of multi-and extremely-drug resistant microbes. In this context, non-toxic nanoparticles could play an important role in conferring protection against bacterial infections and in this study we have made an attempt to show the usefulness of jacalin capped platinum nanoparticles in protecting zebrafish against multiple infections with Aeromonas hydrophila. Our results also indicate that use of nanoparticles promotes adaptive immune response against the pathogen, so much so that zebrafish is able to survive repetitive infection even after twenty one days of being treated with jacalin-capped platinum nanoparticles. This is significant given that platinum salt is not antibacterial and jacalin is non-immunogenic. Our study for the first time reveals a novel mechanism of action of nanoparticles, which could form an alternate antibacterial strategy with minimal bacterial resistance. © 2018 The Author(s).},

The model is developed on the basis of diffusion equations containing a nonlinear term related to Michaelis-Menten (M-M) kinetics. In this paper, Legendre wavelets operational matrix of derivatives are used to solve the nonlinear reaction-diffusion equations. The concentration profile of substrate is computed for various parameter values. Also the dimensionless concentration of substrate is established for the slab, cylinder and spherical pallets in different cases. An approximate/analytical expression for substrate concentration is obtained as a function of the Thiele modulus and the Michaelis constant. The proposed wavelet solutions are compared with Adomian decomposition method (ADM) and numerical solutions. Satisfactory agreement with ADM and numerical is observed for all Thiele modulus and M-M constants. Power of the proposed methods is confirmed. © 2017 Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University},

abstract={The combined effects of electric and magnetic fields on peristaltic flow of Jeffery nanoliquids are analytically investigated. Double-diffusive convection in the asymmetric microchannel is also carried out. The walls of the microchannel are propagating with a finite phase difference in a sinusoidal manner. Rosseland diffusion flux model is employed to examine the thermal radiation effect. The zeta potential on the walls is considered very low to apply Hückel–Debye approximations. The coupled non-linear governing equations are simplified by using dimensional analysis and lubrication theory. The closed form solutions for potential function, nanoparticle fraction field, solute concentration field, temperature field, stream function, and axial velocity are derived under the appropriate boundary conditions. It is noteworthy that the pumping characteristics strongly depend on the magnetic fields, electric fields, electric double layer thickness, Jeffery parameter, thermal radiation and Grashof number. Furthermore, trapping phenomenon is analyzed under the effects of Hartmann number, Jeffrey parameter, Grashof number and Helmholtz–Smoluchowski velocity. The novelty of the present work is the amalgamation of biomimetics (peristaltic propulsion), electro-magneto-hydrodynamics and nanofluid dynamics to produce a smart pump system model for smart drug delivery systems. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) patients respond poorly to chemotherapy. We analyzed the expression of 11 drug response-related genes in 31 OSCC biopsies, collected prior to any treatment, using custom-designed PCR array. Further, we investigated the drug response pattern of selected anticancer drugs by BH3 (Bcl2 Homology-3) profiling in the primary cells isolated from OSCC tissues. Then, we correlated the results of drug-response gene expression pattern with apoptotic priming to predict tumor response to chemotherapy. The best performing drug (BPD) and response differences (RD) between the drugs were identified using statistical methods to select the best choice of drug in a personalized manner. Based on the correlation, we classified OSCC tumors as sensitive (13 tumors), moderately responsive (16 tumors) or resistant (2 tumors) to chemotherapy. We found that up-regulation of genes linked with drug resistance facilitates survival of tumor samples, which was revealed by the percentage of apoptotic priming. Moreover, we found that paclitaxel-induced 40–45% apoptotic priming compared to other drugs. Average response difference (RD) analysis showed that 80% of tumors responded well to paclitaxel as compared to other drugs studied. Therefore, gene expression analysis with BH3 profiling reveals drug sensitivity that could be translated for drug selection before treatment. © 2018, The Author(s).},

abstract={This paper presents an optimized cuttlefish algorithm for feature selection based on the traditional cuttlefish algorithm, which can be used for diagnosis of Parkinson's disease at its early stage. Parkinson is a central nervous system disorder, caused due to the loss of brain cells. Parkinson's disease is incurable and could eventually lead to death but medications can help to control symptoms and elongate the patient's life to some extent. The proposed model uses the traditional cuttlefish algorithm as a search strategy to ascertain the optimal subset of features. The decision tree and k-nearest neighbor classifier as a judgment on the selected features. The Parkinson speech with multiple types of sound recordings and Parkinson Handwriting sample's datasets are used to evaluate the proposed model. The proposed algorithm can be used in predicting the Parkinson's disease with an accuracy of approximately 94% and help individual to have proper treatment at early stage. The experimental result reveals that the proposed bio-inspired algorithm finds an optimal subset of features, maximizing the accuracy, minimizing number of features selected and is more stable. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

The electrocatalytic activity of MoS 2 nanoparticles towards the reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) has been studied using cyclic voltammetry. The experimental parameters such as the effect of scan rate and pH have been optimized for the electrochemical detection of 4-NP. The linear relationship between the peak current and the concentration of 4-nitrophenol was found to be in the range of 4 × 10 −6  M to 2 × 10 −8  M with an impressive detection limit of 10 nM.

Blue phase (BP) liquid crystalline complex is a high potent material for next-generation optoelectronic devices. The structural, optical, and thermal properties of present HBFLC complexes have been characterized by X-ray diffraction techniques (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), polarizing optical microscope (POM), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) techniques. The band gap energy of the present HBFLC complex (4.6 eV) is estimated by UV-Visible spectrometer. X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscope (SEM) studies which confirm the monoclinic nature and morphology of the present complex. Phase diagram of the present CHS + nOBA is constructed from DSC data and the same is discussed. The lower homologous of CHS + nOBA HBFLC (n = 2 to 6) complex shows BPsm1, BPsm2, BPsm3 while higher homologous (n = 7 to 12) exhibiting orthogonal smectic A* (SmA*) character with blue phases. A noteworthy observation is that the identification of extended thermal span of smectic blue phases and induced SmA* phase in the present HBFLCs. Another important observation is that the widest BP range is reported in the present hydrogen-bonded ferroelectric nanoliquid crystalline (HBFNLC) complex which is more suitable for photonic devices. In addition, LC parameters such as, phase width, thermal stability factor, phase transition temperature with enthalpy value, and the origination of orthogonal phases in CHS + nOBA HBFLC complex is also reported. © 2018, Sociedade Brasileira de Física.},

abstract={We investigate the role of axonal transport in regulating neuronal mitochondrial density. We show that the density of mitochondria in the touch receptor neuron (TRN) of adult Caenorhabditis elegans is constant. Mitochondrial density and transport are controlled both by the Kinesin heavy chain and the Dynein-Dynactin complex. However, unlike in other models, the presence of mitochondria in C. elegans TRNs depends on a Kinesin light chain as well. Mutants in the three C. elegans miro genes do not alter mitochondrial density in the TRNs. Mutants in the Kinesin-1 associated proteins, UNC-16/JIP3 and UNC-76/FEZ1, show increased mitochondrial density and also have elevated levels of both the Kinesin Heavy and Light Chains in neurons. Genetic analyses suggest that, the increased mitochondrial density at the distal end of the neuronal process in unc-16 and unc-76 depends partly on Dynein. We observe a net anterograde bias in the ratio of anterograde to retrograde mitochondrial flux in the neuronal processes of unc-16 and unc-76, likely due to both increased Kinesin-1 and decreased Dynein in the neuronal processes. Our study shows that UNC-16 and UNC-76 indirectly limit mitochondrial density in the neuronal process by maintaining a balance in anterograde and retrograde mitochondrial axonal transport. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the major causes of blindness resulting from prolonged hyperglycemia which leads to breakdown of blood retinal barrier and excessive neovascularization. In our previous study, we demonstrated the presence of germline-specific PIWI-like proteins in human retina and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and a discrete function of HIWI2 (PIWIL4) in the assembly of tight junction through Akt/GSK3α/β. Recently, PIWI/piRNA has been suggested to be involved in the development of diabetes. Here, we have investigated the role of HIWI2 in proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). Interestingly, Western blot analysis indicated the elevated expression of HIWI2 in vitreous aspirates of patients with PDR in comparison to macular hole (MH) and rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD). In addition, treatment of ARPE19 with 25% of PDR vitreous aspirate significantly increased the expression of HIWI2. Moreover, exposure of ARPE19 to oxidative stress and VEGF, induced the expression of HIWI2. Further, we knocked down HIWI2 in ARPE19 cells to understand its role in the disease progression. Silencing HIWI2 reduced the expression of growth factors, VEGF and TGFβ1, and altered the expression of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers E-cadherin and αSMA. In addition, expression of MMP9 and cell migration was reduced in Si-HIWI2. Collectively, our report highlights a novel function and association of a piRNA binding protein, HIWI2 to PDR. The elevated expression of HIWI2 in PDR could influence various aspects of the disease pathogenesis, like EMT changes and cell migration. Hence, understanding the exact function of HIWI2 in retina could reveal its potential as a therapeutic target for retinopathy. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a serious disease with diverse prognoses and the diffusive development of the tumors further complicates the diagnosis. However, in most cases, surgery is performed by resecting the tumor that decides the life expectancy of a patient. Certainly, the graphical portrayal is a fundamental factor to distinguish and examine an NPC tumor; and, the exact nasopharyngeal carcinoma perception remains an important errand. It is crucial to improve the extent of resection for the irregular tissues while sparing the normal ones. There are several methods to envision the nasopharyngeal carcinoma, but the main problem with these strategies is the inability to imagine the border points of the nasopharyngeal tumor accurately in detail. In addition, the inability to separate the normal tissues from the undesirable ones prompts the assessment and calculation of a wrong tumor measure. NPC diagnosis is a difficult and challenging process owing to the possible shapes and regions of tumors and intensity of the images. The pathological identification of the nasopharyngeal carcinoma and comparing typical and anomalous tissues require a set of scientific strategies for the extraction of features. The aim of this paper was to outline and assess a novel method using machine learning approaches based on genetic algorithm for NPC feature selection and artificial neural networks for an automated NPC detection of the NPC tissues from endoscopic images. The proposed approach was validated by comparing the number of NPC identified through this technique against the manual checking by the ENT specialists. The classifier lists a high precision of 96.22%, the sensitivity of 95.35%, and specificity of 94.55%. Additionally, the feature chosen process makes the Artificial Neural Networks classifier straightforward and more efficient. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The privacy of patients is jeopardised when medical records and data are spread or shared beyond the protected cloud of institutions. This is because breaches force them to the brink that they start abstaining from full disclosure of their condition. This type of condition has a negative effect on scientific research, patients and all stakeholders. A blockchain-based data sharing system is proposed to tackle this issue, which employs immutability and autonomy properties of the blockchain to sufficiently resolve challenges associated with access control and handle sensitive data. Our proposed system is supported by a Discrete Wavelet Transform to enhance the overall security, and a Genetic Algorithm technique to optimise the queuing optimization technique as well. Introducing this cryptographic key generator enhances the immunity and system access control, which allows verifying users securely in a fast way. This design allows further accountability since all users involved are already known and the blockchain records a log of their actions. Only when the users’ cryptographic keys and identities are confirmed, the system allows requesting data from the shared queuing requests. The achieved execution time per node, confirmation time per node and robust index for block number of 0.19 s, 0.17 s and 20 respectively that based on system evaluation illustrates that our system is robust, efficient, immune and scalable. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Tin sulfide (SnS) thin film was deposited on glass substrates using simple nebulizer spray pyrolysis method. The influence of vacuum annealing on structural, optical, morphological, electrical and photovoltaic properties of the films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, energy dispersive analysis of X- ray, UV-Visible spectrophotometry, photoluminescence spectrofluorometry and Hall measurements. Structural parameters such as lattice structure, crystallite size, micro strain and dislocation density were estimated using XRD analysis. There was a notable enhancement in morphology and surface roughness of the films and they were found to vary with respect to the annealing temperature. Optical studies done on the films revealed a decrease in energy gap for the increase of annealing temperatures. From the Hall effect study, it was found that SnS thin films have p-type conductivity. The lowest resistivity and higher carrier concentration were found to be 0.074 Ω cm and 1.07 × 1019 (cm−3) respectively. A heterojunction solar cell, CdS/SnS was fabricated and its solar conversion efficiency obtained was about 0.73% for tin sulfide films annealed at 400 °C. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In this paper, we address the problem of confidentiality of keyframes, which are extracted from diagnostic hysteroscopy data using video summarization. We propose an image color coding method aimed at increasing the security of keyframes extracted from diagnostic hysteroscopy videos. In this regard, we use a 2-D logistic map to generate the cryptographic keys sequences, which relies on mixing and cascading the orbits of the chaotic map in order to generate the stream keys for the encryption algorithm. The encrypted images produced by our proposed algorithm exhibit randomness behavior, providing a high-level of security for the keyframes against various attacks. The experimental results and security analysis from different perspectives verify the superior security and high efficiency of our proposed encryption scheme compared to other state-of-the-art image encryption algorithms. Furthermore, the proposed method can be combined with mobile-cloud environments and can be generalized to ensure the security of cloud contents as well as important data during transmission. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Globalization has brought opportunities for the countries all over the world. Even in India, many imported products are being sold and Indian products are also being exported throughout the world. In today's scenario the Indian customers are having great access to foreign goods and the Indian manufacturers are having competition from foreign products. The rationale behind the study is to analyse the perception of consumer towards home country products and comprehend towards the quality of product and also to analyse the buying habit of domestic products and foreign products by the undergraduates and postgraduates students. The study was done by collecting responses from 150 student consumers studying in private university. The data was analysed through statistical tools such as descriptive analysis, Friedman test, and Regression. The study reveals a positive relationship between the Quality Consciousness and three other factors viz. home country affinity, Pseudopatriotism and the image of Home Country. The home country affinity played a major role in predicting the consumer ethnocentrism. © 2018 IEEE.},

All electronic properties were calculated using the Density Functional Based Tight Binding(DFTB) Method which provide result similar to DFT methodbut saves computational time. Single layer PNRs structure was optimized and simulated with Hydrogen, Oxygen and without any passivation. The bandstructure, Density of States(DOS) both confirm the superiority of H passivation over others. The same calculation is repeated for the ZPNRs based antidot lattice. We observe that although ZPNRs reduce bandgap in antidot structure irrespective of the passivation, H passivated antidot lattice provide a bandgap in semiconducting range whereas other passivations return metallic behaviour. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Amine containing polymers are extensively studied as special carriers for short-chain RNA (13-25 nucleotides), which are applied as gene silencing agents in gene therapy of various diseases including cancer. Elaboration of the oligonucleotide carriers requires knowledge about peculiarities of the oligonucleotide-polymeric amine interaction. The critical length of the interacting chains is an important parameter which allows us to design sophisticated constructions containing oligonucleotide binding segments, solubilizing, protective and aiming parts. We studied interactions of (TCAG)n, n = 1-6 DNA oligonucleotides with polyethylenimine and poly(N-(3-((3-(dimethylamino)propyl)(methyl)amino)propyl)-N-methylacrylamide). The critical length for oligonucleotides in interaction with polymeric amines is 8-12 units and complexation at these length can be accompanied by "all-or-nothing" effects. New dimethylacrylamide based polymers with grafted polyamine chains were obtained and studied in complexation with DNA and RNA oligonucleotides. The most effective interaction and transfection activity into A549 cancer cells and silencing efficiency against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was found for a sample with average number of nitrogens in polyamine chain equal to 27, i.e., for a sample in which all grafted chains are longer than the critical length for polymeric amine-oligonucleotide complexation. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack remains an exceptional security risk, alleviating these digital attacks are for all intents and purposes extremely intense to actualize, particularly when it faces exceptionally well conveyed attacks. The early disclosure of these attacks, through testing, is critical to ensure safety of end-clients and the wide-ranging expensive network resources. With respect to DDoS attacks-its hypothetical establishment, engineering, and calculations of a honeypot have been characterized. At its core, the honeypot consists of an intrusion prevention system (Interruption counteractive action framework) situated in the Internet Service Providers level. The IPSs then create a safety net to protect the hosts by trading chosen movement data. The evaluation of honeypot promotes broad reproductions and an absolute dataset is introduced, indicating honeypot's activity and low overhead. The honeypot anticipates such assaults and mitigates the servers. The prevailing IDS are generally modulated to distinguish known authority level system attacks. This spontaneity makes the honeypot system powerful against uncommon and strange vindictive attacks. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={The main aim of distribution system is to supply electricity to the consumers at nominal voltage with reduced loss in the distribution system. In order to achieve that, voltage profile should be maintained within safe limits. Due to load changes, maintaining a constant voltage profile is difficult. In order to improve the security, reliability and voltage profile, placement of shunt capacitor in different places of the distribution system becomes essential. These shunt capacitive compensators improve the load carrying capability of the system by controlling the reactive power flow. Installation of shunt capacitors in distribution networks requires consideration on the appropriate location and VAr rating of these capacitors. In this paper, the advanced version of harmony search algorithm called Improved Harmony Search algorithm (IHS) is used to determine the bus location and VAr rating of the capacitor. The capability of IHS to search the optimal bus location and VAr rating is tested on 33 bus radial distribution system. The results shows that there is a nearly 32% of loss reduction in system with promising voltage profile. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={The focus of this project is 5-bar parallel manipulator. There are many approaches to eliminate the singularities of this kind of manipulators, like redundant actuation, connecting two inverse kinematic solutions without a singularity, topology of self-motion manifolds of redundant manipulators, self-motion, extending the link length by prismatic joints etc. In this project, a novel approach is proposed to eliminate the singularities from the workspace. This investigation is proposed to be carried out for 2-DOF planar parallel manipulator to establish the concept. One of the base actuators (motors) is fixed to a linear actuator. This linear actuator extends when the end-effector is in the proximity of singularity loci. As the manipulator clears out of the singularity condition, then again, the parallel manipulator is reverted back to the original position by the linear actuator. Mathematically, when the manipulator attains a singularity condition, the Jacobian matrix loses/gains rank. A reconfiguration of the manipulator to a defined degree at this instance ensures a change in the determinant of the Jacobian matrix to a non-zero value, thereby avoiding the singularity condition. Once the singularity loci are avoided, the base length is reverted to its actual state by the linear actuator for the same trajectory of the end-effector within the defined workspace of the manipulator. As a result, the used trajectories remain unaffected by the effect of singularities and thus improve the efficiency of the parallel manipulator significantly. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Soil as a construction material offers the most economic and effective alternative toward solving the huge demand for low cost housing units, as it imposes the least demand on resources, particularly in tropical regions. But the strength and durability of soil blocks is a major concern. Therefore, an investigation was carried out to reinforce soil blocks with natural and synthetic fibres in an attempt to offer an economic and sustainable alternative without compromising the strength and function. A comparison on the performance of soil blocks reinforced with four different fibres – alkali resistant glass, polypropylene, banana and jute were studied. The effect of fibre reinforcement on the physical, mechanical and durability properties were examined for the fibre contents of 0.25%, 0.50%, 0.75% and 1% by weight of soil. The optimum percentage of fibre reinforcement for each type of fibre was determined. The study shows that fibre reinforcement augments the performance of the soil blocks significantly. It improves the strength & resistance to erosion and wearing of the soil blocks and deters its susceptibility to shrinking and cracking. Reinforcement with jute fibre yielded the maximum strength and was also observed to be the most durable option of the selected fibres. Natural fibre reinforced soil blocks were also the most economic option among the fibres studied. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

In recent times, throughout a lot of attention is being drawn to evaluate the risk due to landslides. The invention of remote sensing and GIS have been new vistas in the field of geo scientific studies viz. geomorphological mapping, groundwater potential mapping, disaster management etc. The present study has been undertaken to study different thematic maps like, contour, drainage, slope, aspect, curvature, DEM, DTM, drainage density, drainage intensity, geology, lineament, lineament density, lineament intensity, geomorphology, land use, weathering thickness, run off, soil thickness and buffer maps like road, drainage, lineament etc. in CNG ghat section, Gudalur, The Nilgiris. For this purpose, the satellite image IRS - RS2, LISS III January 2014 used to prepare different thematic maps. The contour, drainage and road network were incorporate from SoI Toposheets. The slope, curvature, aspects and buffer maps were prepared from GIS environments. Based on field studies, above said thematic maps (22 nos.) were prepared and were grouped into 3 categories viz. Geology, Hydrology and Terrain. In each category the input maps were assigned different score as well as each layer has been given different weightage. Finally the categories are analysed through multi - criteria analysis to find out 5 different vulnerability classes. The 5 different land susceptibility zones are classified as very low, low, moderate, high and very high. The percentages of area under different susceptibility classes are 3%, 20%, 51%, 25%, and 1% respectively. The locations of small area major landslides and slip locations were calculated from different years using (2010 and 2014) Trimble GPS in the field. The field data was converted into point layer in GIS and landslide inventory map was prepared. This map was superimposed in landslide susceptibility zonation map. As per field data 0%, 9.25%, 57.5%, 32% and 1.25% Slide points are come under very low, low, moderate, high, very high susceptibility zones respectively. © Authors 2018.},

abstract={Human superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn SOD1) is a homodimeric enzyme. Mutations in Cu/Zn SOD1 causes a familial form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (fALS), and aggregation of mutant SOD1 has been proposed to play a role in neurodegeneration. Though a majority of the mutations are point substitutions, there are a few changes that result in amino acid deletions or truncations of the polypeptide. These pathogenic mutations are scattered throughout the three-dimensional structure of the dimeric enzyme, which creates a puzzling pattern to investigate the molecular determinants of fALS. The most common hypothesis proposed that the misfolding of SOD1 mutants are primarily triggered by decreased affinity for metal ions. However, this hypothesis is challenging, as a significant number of disease-causing mutations are located far away from the metal-binding site and dimer interface. So in the present study, we have investigated the influence of such a far positioned pathogenic mutation, V14M, in altering the stability and folding of the Cu/Zn SOD1. Though the location of Val14 is far positioned, it has a vital role in the stability of SOD1 by preserving its hydrophobic cluster at one end of the β barrel domain. We have performed MD simulations of the V14M mutant for 80 ns timescale. The results reveal the fact that irrespective of its location, V14M mutation triggers a conformational change that is more similar to that of the metal-deficient holo form and could resemble an intermediate state in the folding reaction which results in protein misfolding and aggregation. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Predicting the class labels for each pixel in a remote sensing image is a very challenging task. Due to the high spatial resolution of the remote sensing data, each pixel in a remote sensing image has a meaningful information. Therefore, identifying the homogeneous regions and annotating them with significant land cover information remains an open challenge. To handle this challenge supervised machine learning methods are adopted and they play a key role in dealing with these high dimensional data and understanding the landcover information of the geographical surfaces in a remote sensing image. The main aim of this study is to analyse the performance of different supervised learning algorithms for labelling each pixel for the images obtained from International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) Vaihingen. From the comparative analysis it is concluded that the fine Gaussian support vector machine outperforms the other state of the art techniques with an overall classification Accuracy of about 75.1448%. © 2018 IEEE.},

The developed combined tent-logistic (CTL), combined sine-logistic (CSL) and combined sine-tent (CST) maps with improved chaotic behaviour are utilised to generate the key sequences. These chaotic key sequences from CTL, CSL and CST are then quantised to embed the secret bits in high-high, high-low and low-high sub-bands of the IWT transformed cover image, respectively.

abstract={This study pioneers the concept of a novel layered two stage fibrous concrete (LTSFC) subjected to falling weight collision. The LTSFC is a newly developed concrete, with unique combination of steel fibres and coarse aggregates that are premixed and preplaced in the formwork in three layers followed by a flowable grout injection in each layer to fill the voids. In this study, some LTSFC slabs were proposed to consider the combined effect of layered and two stage concrete containing different type and combinations of steel fibres. Nine slabs were proposed, casted and tested, for which firstly the LTSFC were prepared and reinforced in three layers of 4%, 2% and 4% with three different fibres viz., crimped fibre (CF), hooked end fibre (HF), combined CF and HF and combined long and short CF. Secondly, the slabs were reinforced with 3.3% of same type of steel fibres over the entire cross section. The average amount of fibre used in LTSFC specimen was 3.3% which is similar to the fibre dosage used in the second series, where the fibres are equally spread in entire cross section. The study parameters viz., number of repeated impacts that induce the first crack and failure, impact ductility ratio, crack resistance (service and ultimate) and impact crack resistance ratio were considered herein. The results indicated that LTSFC specimens exhibited significant increase in the number of repeated impacts for the initial crack and failure to occur, high crack resistance, enhanced ductility and impact crack resistance ratio when related with non-fibrous concrete. Hence, the most significant findings of this research should stimulate innovation and new technology to develop the novel LTSFC in future studies. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

The model is trained using the data obtained from the simulation of transistor-level circuit models. The proposed model is compatible with Verilog-A.

abstract={This work is aimed at the development of a finite element formulation for the analysis of unsymmetric magneto-electric (ME) laminated structures. While analytical solutions are readily available for symmetric structures, the coupling between axial and bending deformations in unsymmetric structures impedes such an analytical solution thus motivating the search for a numerical solution. The proposed finite element model includes this coupling under Euler-Bernoulli assumptions and further includes the material nonlinearity exhibited by the ferromagnetic phase. The enhancement of the ME coefficient under resonant conditions has also been studied under bending and axial resonant regimes. Resonant ME coefficients of magnitude at least 30 times higher than the quasi-static values were estimated. A parametric study has also been performed with the aim of optimizing the ME coefficient with respect to the applied DC bias field, operating frequency, volume fraction and the modulus ratio of the constituents and the different boundary conditions. The boundary conditions yielding a cantilever configuration were found to offer the least bending resonant frequency and the highest axial resonant ME coefficient, thus proving to be the most viable in practice. © 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={A periodically forced Liénard system is capable of generating frequent large-amplitude chaotic bursts for a range of system and external forcing parameter values which are known as mixed mode oscillations. Particularly, if these large chaotic bursts occur infrequently and randomly, then they are characterized as extreme events. We present a numerical study of the effect of self-time-delay feedback on these extreme events in this system and interestingly find that extreme events can be completely eliminated from the system dynamics, even for smaller values of delay feedback strength. We show here that the number of extreme events is reduced, and the probability of the occurrence of high-amplitude events is transformed from a long-tailed statistics to the localized structure, as a function of the feedback strength corroborates our results. Further, we show that the autonomous Liénard system loses its conservative nature when delay feedback is added and only a dissipative nature remains in the entire phase space, which is the underlying mechanism behind the elimination of such large events. Further, we have revealed a type of delay-induced damping behavior, named anomalous damping, in which the amplitude of the oscillations suddenly vanishes when the total energy of the system becomes zero. © 2018 American Physical Society.},

abstract={An erosion model using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) equation derived from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Global Digital Elevation Model (ASTER G-DEM) and LANDSAT 8 is presented in the study. This model can be a cost-effective, quick and less labor-intensive tool for assessing erosion in small watersheds. It can also act as a vital input for the primary assessment of environmental degradation in the region, and can aid the formulation of watershed development planning strategies. The Palar River, which drains into Shanmukha Nadi, is a small mountain watershed. The town of Kodaikanal, a popular tourist attraction in Tamilnadu, forms part of this sub-watershed. This quaint, hill-town has been subjected to intense urbanization and exhaustive changes in its land use practices for the past decade. The consequence of this change is manifested in the intense environmental degradation of the region, which results in problems such as increased numbers of landslides, intense soil erosion, forest fires and land degradation. The nature of the terrain, high precipitation, and intense agriculture exponentially increase the rate of soil erosion. Spatial prediction of soil erosion is thereby a valuable and mandatory tool for sustainable land use practices and economic development of the region. A comprehensive methodology is employed to predict the spatial variation of soil erosion using the revised soil loss equation in a geographic information system (GIS) platform. The soil erosion susceptibility map shows a maximum annual soil loss of 3345 Mg·ha-1·y-1, which correlates with scrub forests, degraded forests, steep slopes, high drainage density and shifting cultivation practices. The erosion map shows that the central region is subjected to intense erosion while the inhabited southern part is less prone to erosion. A small patch of severe soil loss is also visible on the eastern part of the northern fringe. About 4% of the sub-watershed is severely affected by soil erosion and 18% falls within a moderate erosion zone. The growing demand for land and infrastructure development forces the shift of urbanization and agriculture to these less-managed spaces. In light of this scenario, the spatial distribution of erosion combined with terrain and hydro-morphometry can aid in sustainable development and promote healthy land use practices in the region. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={The design of a spatial parallel robot is governed by two factors: volume of the workspace and shape of the workspace. In this paper, we subject a 6-DOF 3RRRS parallel manipulator having symmetric link lengths, under research. The most commonly used method to solve robot kinematics based on the Denavit-Hartenberg (D-H) notation. Since its inverse kinematics involves complicated calculations and solutions, there has been a need to develop a new method which can meet the demands of real-time applications. Derived from the basis of screw theory, a new improved inverse kinematic approach, which improves the efficiency of the inverse kinematics, is used. Along with Paden-Kahan sub-problems, a new and improved subproblem is used to counter the aforementioned problems. In order to arrive at a robust design, the required volume is taken as input while all parameters relating to a manipulator design, such as the link lengths, the moving plate and base plate radius, the orientation, the home angle configuration are all treated as variables while computing the inverse kinematics. In each case, the corresponding geometric relationship between the parameters of the manipulators is established. The configuration which satisfies the user requirements as well as with the least amount of singularities is provided as the result. © 2018 IEEE.},

An experiment has been done for three different concentrations of hydrogen peroxide. Distilled water was taken as a base reference for the plot. The test liquid was made to flow through a glass tube, and the refractive index was measured using an IR transceiver setup. The values obtained using NI-cDAQ for various concentrations are compared. These concentration variations detected by the sensor is accurate and precise. The sensor will be cost effective when compared to the ones available commercially. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={The 3D printer is a three-dimensional prototyping machine which fabricates desired shape by layer over layer material deposition. The printer's extruder should be at its homing position before any deposition process begins. Also keeping the deposition process within the specified limits of movement is very vital. The precise positioning of the extruder can be done using limit switches. This paper focuses on using a hall sensor as a limit switches and comparing its advantages over conventionally used intrusive sensors (mechanical switches). If the movement of the extruder is not within the given workspace, undesirable dimensional changes may happen in the end product. Conventionally the positioning is done by using mechanical switches which may undergo wear and need a regular replacement. The limit switch is an electromagnetic device which restricts the movement of the extruder outside the permissible limit. The limit switch detects the motion of the machine parts and sends feedback to the controller which in turn control the machine. When compared to a opto switch, the device is relatively cheap with all the desired characteristics including no wear. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={In the world's current energy scenario, it has become glaringly obvious that we should depend on alternative sources of energy. The most common and abundant of these renewable sources is solar energy. The primary issue with large scale dependency on solar energy is the low efficiency of present day solar cells and the weather around solar power installations. This brings us to the topic of this paper, Maximum power point tracking or MPPT. The maximum power point on the I-V characteristics of a solar cell fluctuates relentlessly due to a multitude of factors including variation in solar radiation, the temperature of the PV cell, the current/power-voltage characteristics under varied temperature and the load connected to the PV cell. For maximizing the output of the cell, the maximum power point must be constantly tracked. Hence the reason why most solar power electronic converters have controllers that utilize some form of maximum power point tracking (MPPT). In the span of the last few years, numerous MPPT techniques have been published. But the techniques that were found to be most fitting for various ranges of PV application are perturb and observe (PO), and Incremental conductance (IC). © 2018 IEEE.},

The measurement of milli thrust which is of the order of few Newton requires specialized measuring systems. In the present work, a force sensing resistor (FSR) is used to measure such low valued thrust. A commercially available FSR is calibrated using standard weights. The FSR response to added loads is recorded using a NI-DAQ (National Instruments - Data Acquisition) system and signals are analyzed using LabView package in a desktop. The calibrated values match well with the standard charts and percentage of error is calculated. The thrust produced by the fabricated nozzle setup is measured using FSR in the same arrangement and compared with the analytical equations.

abstract={Green is slowly but steadily giving birth to the eco-consciousness in India. Green movement focuses on exceeding consumer expectations with eco-friendly technology products. But Indian consumers are not yet fully aware of the green technology products. Many companies are making concentrated efforts to create a sustainable business by in the green space. This paper studies the consumer perspectives of Tanjavur, their level of awareness and agreement on green technology products, their purchase decision, frequency of purchase, and constraints they face in adopting green technology products. This paper has conceived a model with suitable dependent and independent variables, collected primary data using questionnaire and analysed the same with Structural Equation Modelling using Visual PLS software. It is found that although consumers come to know about green technology products from various sources, their mere awareness does not significantly translate into purchase decisions. Alternatively, awareness helps the consumer agree and believe in the concept of green and then make the purchase decision. It is also observed that better understanding of green technology products minimises the perceived constraints in purchase and use of green technology products. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={These days renewable energy plays an important role in power production sector as the availability of fossil fuels reduces day by day rapidly. Efficient operation of solar panel is necessary for power production in both qualitative and quantitative manner. This can be gained only by means of providing optimal cooling to the panel. The main advantage of cooling the panel is to increase its efficiency to a certain extent to achieve qualitatively good power output. Climatic conditions[1] also play a major role in reducing the output of solar panel. Due to heavy winds dust gets deposited over the surface of the panel which reduces the amount of light falling on the panel reducing its output. So an equipment is needed to clean the panel as well as to cool it. The design and its working is illustrated below. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={In Today's world, medical diagnostics by tele-communication plays a major role in people life. There brings a need for securing medical data when transmitted over an insecure communication channel. To ensure the confidentiality, integrity and authenticity for the medical images when transmitted, we propose an algorithm named SLICE abbreviated from Scrambling LogIstic Chaotic Encoding to ensure security for the medical documents and images transaction. The input DI-COM image is scrambled pixel by pixel and is distributed in an unexplored manner. A random pixel value is obtained from the image by performing splitting and shifting operation. The chaotic map is then applied. The image from chaotic map is then DNA encoded. The DNA encoding performs a masking operation on the pixel value to obtain a binary sequence. The binary sequence is added with the obtained random pixel value. All these phases are reversed to decrypt the encrypted image. Since the key has strong sensitiveness, decoding becomes very difficultand hence ensures security of patient's medical document. This ensures the algorithm protects patient's medical images. Experimental results have shown that the proposed algorithm maintains a high level of integrity and robustness. The algorithm also provides a promising performance and computational efficiency for securing digital medical encryption using DICOM images. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={In the nanotechnology era, design and development of heterostructures are quiet often persuade exciting materials properties. These nanostructures have been investigated towards numerous applications including gas sensors over the years. In this background, we have solely investigated the charge transport properties, and role of photon interaction in the spray deposited ZnO/CdS heterostructure. Observed crystal structure of heterostructure revealed the formation of hexagonal wurtzite structure of ZnO and hexagonal phase of CdS respectively. Compositional analysis of deposited ZnO/CdS heterostructure showed the predominance of cadmium. Layered morphology of ZnO and CdS was observed with agglomerated nanograins on the surface. The exciton-phonon coupling strength of the heterostructure was found to be 0.2194. Heterostructure showed a fascinating figure of merits towards formaldehyde vapor at room temperature under photonic interaction. The lowest detection limit of formaldehyde was found to be 10 ppm. The response and recovery times for 10 ppm formaldehyde were 78 and 25 s respectively. Facile and low-cost heterostructure fabrication, high sensitive detection, long-term stability, faster response-recovery profile with better transient characteristics are the novel features of this work. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

The RWA problem is known to be NP-complete integer linear programming ILP problem. Most of the previous work in the field focuses RWA problem in optical networks with static connection requests and wavelength conversion. In this paper our study attempts to provide better utilization of wavelength and devices for wavelength conversion and grooming, thereby leading to minimization of number of wavelengths and cost of wavelength conversion and grooming. The proposed genetic algorithm GA heuristic with single objective and multi objective fitness functions provide better results for the RWA adopting first fit wavelength assignment and most used wavelength assignment methods. The simulation studies have been carried out over 14-node NSFNET network with the objective of minimizing blocking probability.

abstract={Dual fuel engines use a wide variety of gaseous fuels efficiently while emitting less smoke and NOx than their diesel counterparts. However, they suffer from poor brake thermal efficiency, and high hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions, particularly at lower loads. The aim of this study is to improve the performance and emission characteristics of a low heat rejection diesel engine operating in dual fuel mode, particularly at part load. In this study, a single-cylinder, four-stroke, water cooled, direct injection diesel engine was modified to dual fuel mode. Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) as the primary fuel was mixed with air at the intake manifold, compressed, and ignited by a small pilot spray of biodiesel as the secondary fuel. The biodiesel was prepared from palm oil using a simple base catalyst transesterification process. From the experimental results, it was observed that at part load operation,the brake thermal efficiency of coated engine running on dual fuel of LPG and biodiesel was improved by3%. Hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions were reduced by 12% and 17%, respectively, and also a significant reduction of NOx emission from 9%to14% at entire load spectrum compared to diesel and dual fuel operation in uncoated engine. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Extracts of the leaves, roots, stem, seeds and bark of Albizia amara have been scientifically proven to have certain anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activities. They were also indicated in traditional folk medicine for treatment of wounds, abscesses, boils and dandruff. The purpose of this study is to experimentally prove the wound healing efficiency of A. amara leaves extract in Wistar rats with excision wound models, for the first time. Aqueous and ethanolic extracts of A. amara leaves were obtained by Soxhlet extraction and subjected to qualitative phytochemical screening, which confirmed the presence of secondary metabolites such as alkaloids, cardiac glycosides, saponins, phenols and tannins. The GC–MS results showed the presence of n-hexadeconoic acid and phytol in significant amounts that contribute majorly for wound healing activity. The aqueous and ethanolic extracts exhibited significant anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activity in vitro determined by reducing power assay and red blood cell membrane stabilization assay, respectively. Topical gels were formulated using different polymers, wherein 1% Carbopol gel containing the extract was identified with optimum pH and gel viscosity as 5,00,000 cP at shear rate of 1.5 s− 1 and considered suitable for the in vivo wound healing study in Wistar rats. The animals were divided into five groups and treated with topical application of standard povidone-iodine ointment, plain gel vehicle base, gels incorporated with extract at low, medium and high doses of extract, respectively. The healing process was dose-dependent with respect to the concentrations of the plant extract. The animals treated with the gel containing the extract showed greater wound healing effect compared to standard povidone treated (P &lt;.05) groups. Therefore, topical gel prepared with 1% carbopol and 15% Albizia amara leaves extract exhibited potential wound healing activity in excision type of wounds. © 2018 SAAB},

abstract={Food plants Hungarian wax pepper (HWP) and Green Bell pepper (GBP), belonging to Capsicum annuum were utilized for biogenic fabrication of zero valent, nano-silver (AgNPs) through a photo-mediation procedure. In the bacterial strains evaluated, HWP/GBP AgNPs demonstrated effective bacteriostatic and bactericidal effect against Staphylococcus aureus. Time kill results portrayed that HWP/GBP nano-silver exhibited comparable bactericidal potency on S. aureus. Anti-biofilm potential of HWP/GBP AgNPs displayed significant effects at sub MIC levels, by triggering 50% biofilm reduction of the food spoilage microbe S. aureus, inferring that the anti-biofilm outcome is not dependent on antibacterial result, and this was confirmed by SEM and fluorescence studies. Histopathological analyses of S. aureus infected zebrafish liver did not display any abnormality changes such as extensive cell death and degeneration, upon treatment with HWP/GBP AgNPs and the zero-valent silver nanoparticles were comparatively less toxic and more operative in restraining the bioburden in S. aureus infected zebrafish model by a >1.7 log fold.

abstract={Abstract: The explosive vapors like 2,4-dinitrotoluene, M-dinitrobenzene, 2,4,6-trinitrophenol, and 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene are detected with the aid of arsenene nanotube (As-NT). In order to identify the adsorption capability of explosive vapors on arsenene nanotube, its electronic properties are explored. The transmission of electrons between the As-NT and the explosive vapors are affirmed from the density of states spectrum and charge transfer. Moreover, the adsorption energy, energy band gap and Bader charge transfer of the isolated and explosive vapors adsorbed on As-NT validate the adsorption behavior.

abstract={Green synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) is environmentally satisfactory because of their low cost and safe to nature. In the present study, extract of an agricultural waste, coconut (Cocos nucifera) shell is used to synthesize AgNPs and their antibacterial effect was investigated against selected human pathogens Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium. The AgNPs synthesized using coconut shell extract (CSE-AgNPs) were characterized using UV–Visible spectroscopy (absorption peak at 432 nm), Transmission Electron Microscopy (spherical shaped particles size of 14.2–22.96 nm), Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy indicating the CSE capping around the AgNPs (Peaks 1384, 1609 and 3418 corresponds to organic molecules) and X-Ray Diffraction (Peak at 32.078 and 2-Theta). CSE-AgNPs exhibited zone of inhibition against S. aureus (15 mm), E. coli (13 mm), S. typhimurium (13 mm) and L. monocytogenes (10 mm) and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 26, 53, 106 and 212 μg/ml, respectively. Growth curve assay showed the effectiveness of CSE-AgNPs to inhibit the selected pathogens when compared to amphicillin control and extract. Scanning electron microscopy results indicated that the cell wall degradation might be the possible mechanism of antibacterial action of CSE-AgNPs. Different concentrations of AgNPs (0.078–2.5 mg/ml) showed no toxicity against human PBMC cell line. Hence, such highly effective CSE-AgNPs could be explored as antibacterial agent. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Atorvastatin and fenofibrate have been conventionally employed as lipid-lowering agents. They also exhibit beneficial effects in the treatment of endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress and vascular inflammation due to their pleiotropic effects that include vasodilatory and anti-inflammatory effects. These pleiotropic effects may serve to overcome the drawbacks of late stent thrombosis and delayed endothelialization that plague conventional drug eluting stents. However, the combination has not been explored yet as therapeutic coatings in drug eluting stents. The present study aims to investigate the potential of atorvastatin-fenofibrate combination loaded in a biodegradable poly(L-lactide-co-caprolactone) polymer film to inhibit thrombus formation and macrophage activation apart from exploring their effect on the proliferation of smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells. The dual drug-loaded polymer films were characterized by spectroscopy and calorimetry. In vitro studies revealed that the combination effectively retarded the proliferation of only smooth muscle cells but not the endothelial cells which augers well for stent applications where rapid re-endothelialization is preferred. Further, the dual drug-loaded films exhibited a marked decrease in the adhesion and activation of platelets and macrophages revealing the potent anti-thrombogenic and anti-inflammatory effects of the combination. The pleiotropic effects of the combination may be attributed to their ability to activate nitric oxide synthase in endothelial cells while mTOR levels remained unaltered by the combination. © 2018},

abstract={Ferroelectric materials, due to their electrocaloric behaviour, are considered as a promising alternative for the vapour compression refrigeration system and the solid state heat engine which converts the heat energy into electrical energy. In the present work, a novel indirect method based on thermodynamic framework is introduced to obtain electrocaloric properties in terms of adiabatic temperature change. A constitutive model has also been developed with an idea of infinite yield surfaces, to capture the ferroelectric response over a range of cyclic electric field with different amplitudes and temperature values. The model parameters are identified based on the experimental results for PbZrxTi1-xO3 (PZT). Using these parameters, simulations are performed to compute the change in polarization with temperature at different values of applied electric field, based on the proposed theoretical approach. The polarization temperature relation thus obtained, is used to calculate adiabatic temperature change (ΔT). The same model is used to simulate pyroelectric energy harvesting cycle (Olsen cycle), to estimate the harvested energy density per cycle (N D) of PZT from waste heat source for low power systems. © 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={A series of ferulic acid (FA) derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for its ability to inhibit NorA efflux in methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), by in silico docking analysis. Based on prediction from glide scores and ability to reduce EtBr MIC, two of the ten derivatives S3- [4-((E)-2-(diethylcarbamoyl)vinyl)-2-methoxyphenyl acetate] and S6- [(E)-methyl 3-(4-((p-tolylcarbamoyl)methoxy)-3-methoxyphenyl)acrylate] were chosen as putative efflux pump inhibitors (EPI's). Time dependent accumulation studies revealed that S6 caused enhanced EtBr accumulation relative to standard NorA efflux inhibitor reserpine, in clinical isolate of MRSA (CIMRSA) and in NorA overexpressed strain of S. aureus (SA1199B). S6 also exhibited synergy with Ciprofloxacin (CPX) against NorA overexpressed strain (SA1199B) of S. aureus but not in NorA knock out strain (K1758). MIC reversal studies showed that S3 in CIMRSA and S6 in NorA overexpressed strain of S. aureus (SA1199B), caused a 4 fold reduction in CPX MIC. In vitro time kill studies revealed that both S3 and S6 with sub MIC of CPX caused a significant 4 log CFU decline in CIMRSA. A decline of >3 log fold CFU by time kill assay implies synergy between FA derivatives and CPX. When tested in vivo in infected muscle tissue of zebrafish both S3 and S6 with CPX caused >3.2 log decline in CIMRSA cell counts relative to CPX treatment alone. Of the two potent derivatives, S6 probably acts through NorA whereas S3 might exert its effect through pump other than NorA. Greater in vitro and in vivo efficiency of FA derivatives implies its potential to be used as an adjuvant along with CPX to curtail MRSA infection in higher animal models. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Chitosan (CS), glycerophosphate (GP) based injectable hydrogels are explored for its implications in bone defect healing and regeneration. Both acellular and cell laden CS based hydrogels are widely investigated and improved through the inclusion of various nanoparticles, polymers and bioactive molecules. In order to improve its applicability for bone tissue repair, we developed an injectable, thermosensitive CS hydrogel containing graphene oxide (GO) and investigated its properties. The hydrogels were investigated for its porous architecture using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), swelling property, protein adsorption ability, degradation rate and exogenous biomineralization. GO addition improved the physico-chemical properties with notable betterment. The CS/GP/GO hydrogel was biocompatible to mesenchymal stem cells and they were metabolically active upon encapsulation. The hydrogel promoted osteogenic differentiation of mouse mesenchymal stem cells by upregualtion of Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), Type -1 collagen (COL-1), and osteocalcin (OC) under osteogenic conditions. The hydrogel proves to be an amenable platform for carrying cells and exhibited suitable properties to be a potential candidate for bone tissue regeneration. © 2018},

abstract={In the present study, the copper oxide nanoparticles (gCON) were synthesized from the extract of Prosopis juliflora (Sw.) leaves using copper nitrate, a leachate product of the waste printed circuit boards mediated through the bio-hydrometallurgical process. The synthesized gCON was characterized through the UV–Vis, Raman, FT-IR, zeta potential, XRD, BET model and SEM. Methylene blue (MB) adsorption onto gCON tested in batch trials by varying the pH, initial adsorbate concentration and contact time. The chemical kinetics of MB adsorption followed the pseudo-second-order and chemisorptive Elovich models with a high degree of linearity (r2 &gt; 0.99) and marginal error values. Further, the isotherm data suggested the monolayer coverage of MB as the experimental data aligns well with the Langmuir model (r2 &gt; 0.99) and the maximum dye adsorption capacity (qm) of gCON was computed as 163.93 mg/g. The magnitude of thermodynamic functions identified the chemisorptive removal of MB as spontaneous and endothermic. The mass transfer analysis verified that both intra-particle and liquid film diffusion limits the adsorption process. Desorption results showed that gCON can be regenerated for a maximum of three cycles. The present study demonstrated that gCON can be used as an unconventional adsorbent for the removal of MB from aqueous solutions. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In this work, phytoprotein functionalized platinum nanoparticles (PtNCs) were synthesized using the proteins from fresh green spinach leaves. Transmission electron microscopy showed that PtNCs were spherical shape with size ∼5 nm, which self assembled into spherical platinum nanoclustures (PtNCs) with size within the range of 100–250 nm. The presence of elemental platinum was confirmed by EDX analysis. FTIR studies confirm that the PtNCs were stabilized by the protein. As prepared PtNCs inhibits the growth of the food borne pathogen, Salmonella typhi with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 12.5 μM. Light microscopy evidenced that the PtNCs can damage the established biofilms. Antibacterial mechanistic study revealed that PtNCs damages the S. typhi membranes, which was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy and further by fluorescence microscopy using acridine orange/propidium iodide dual staining assay. Besides membrane damage, PtNCs also triggered the intracellular ROS-mediated oxidative damage over the antioxidant defense and kills S. typhi. The hemolytic test showed low cytotoxicity of PtNCs at 100 μM (four times higher the MIC). Finally, the therapeutic efficacy of PtNCs was validated in S. typhi infected zebrafish animal model and the obtained results are discussed. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Supply chain management (SCM) is an attractive area for research which has seen tremendous growth in the past decades. From the literature we observe that, supplier outsourcing (SO) is a highly explored research field in SCM which lacks significant scientific contribution. The major concern in SO is the decision makers’ (DMs) viewpoint which are often vague and imprecise. To better handle such imprecision, in this paper, we propose a new two-stage decision-making framework called TSDMF, which uses hesitant fuzzy information as input. In the first stage, the DMs’ preferences are aggregated using a newly proposed simple hesitant fuzzy-weighted geometry operator, which uses hesitant fuzzy weights for better understanding the importance of each DM. Following this, in the second stage, criteria weights are estimated using newly proposed hesitant fuzzy statistical variance method and finally, a new ranking method called three-way hesitant fuzzy VIKOR (TWHFV) is proposed by extending the VIKOR ranking method to hesitant fuzzy environment. This ranking method uses three categories viz., cost, benefit and neutral along with Euclid distance for its formulation. The practicality of the proposed TSDMF is verified by demonstrating a supplier outsourcing example in an automobile factory. The robustness of TWHFV is realized by using sensitivity analysis and other strengths of TSDMF are discussed by comparison with another framework. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Arsenic is a major water contaminant, threat to human health and country's economy. Arsenic can occur in different oxidation states (−3, 0, +3 and +5) out of which arsenite (As3+) and arsenate (As5+) are highly toxic. Identification and quantification of such toxicant has become a major challenge. Towards this, a highly electro catalytic ruthenium bipyridine – graphene oxide ([Ru(bpy)3]2+-GO) nanocomposite electrode is utilized. The nanocomposite modified screen printed electrode (SPE) shows an enhanced surface area and electron transfer due to the π-π stacking interactions of nanocomposite. Metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) property of the composite and its role in detecting arsenic species have been studied. Differential pulse voltammetric response of [Ru(bpy)3]2+-GO modified SPE exhibits three oxidation peaks at 0.38, 0.67 and 0.97 V. The challenge of thermodynamic limitation due to inner layer As(0) deposition is overcome. The nanocomposite modified electrode exhibits high catalytic activity towards the oxidation of As(III) and As(V) with the detection limits of 21 and 34 nM in the wide linear range of 0.08–15 µM. The developed sensing element is selective and exhibits good repeatability and reproducibility at a mean response of 32 µA with a relative standard deviation (RSD) of 2.67 and 2.84% respectively. The selective nature of [Ru(bpy)3]2+-GO nanocomposite in quantifying arsenite and arsenate helps in water quality assessment. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Background: Success of a school vision screening program depends on compliance with the advice that is offered to the children. This study evaluates the effect of an intervention package on compliance to spectacle wear and referral in a school vision screening program. Methods: Among 8,442 children aged 13–17 years in 11 government schools in and around Chennai, India, 114 (2.2 per cent) children who required spectacles were allocated to the control arm (5,116 children) and 124 (3.7 per cent) children to the intervention arm (3,326 children). There were 44 (0.9 per cent) children in the control arm and 49 (1.5 per cent) children in the intervention arm who required referral for further management. Control schools received a conventional school screening protocol and intervention schools received 23-step interventions. Spectacle wear was noted in an unannounced direct observation after one, four and 12 months. Compliance to referral was noted based on the response of children with confirmation from medical records. Results: Spectacle compliance was significantly higher for the intervention arm compared to the control arm based on direct observation in the first month (17.6 per cent versus 49 per cent, adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 4.4, 95 per cent confidence interval [CI] 2.3–8.5, p < 0.05); in the fourth month (23 per cent versus 56 per cent, OR = 4.2, 95 per cent CI 2.3–7.8, p < 0.05); and in the 12th month (13.3 per cent versus 38.8 per cent, OR = 4.1, 95 per cent CI 1.8–9.4, p < 0.05). Referral compliance was significantly higher in the intervention arm in the first month (17.5 per cent versus 70.5 per cent, OR = 10.9, 95 per cent CI 3.8–30.9, p < 0.001) and in the fourth month (31.7 per cent versus 75.6 per cent, OR = 6.2, 95 per cent CI 2.3–16.0, p < 0.001). Conclusion: A 23-step package of interventions was effective in improving compliance to spectacle wear and referral among adolescents in a school vision screening program. © 2018 Optometry Australia},

abstract={Domestication of rice (Oryza sativa) included conversion of perennial wild species with few seeds to short plants that produced abundant seeds. Most domestication-associated changes were due to variations in transcription factors and other key proteins such as enzymes. Here, we show that multiple yield-related traits associated with indica rice domestication are linked to micro (mi) RNA-mediated regulation. Analysis of small (s) RNA data sets from cultivated indica rice lines, a few landraces, and two wild relatives of rice revealed the presence of abundant 22-nucleotide (nt) reads in wild relatives that mapped to miR397 precursors. miR397 was expressed at very high levels in wild relatives and at negligible levels in high-yielding cultivated lines. In its genera-specific form of 22-nt, miR397 targeted mRNAs encoding laccases that decayed and induced robust secondary cascade silencing in wild species that required RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6. In wild species of rice, reduced expression of laccases resulted in low lignification. As expected, overexpression of miR397 induced de-domestication phenotypes. At least 26 uncharacterized QTLs previously implicated in rice yield overlapped with laccases and miR397 genes. These results suggest that miRNAs contribute to rice domestication-associated phenotypes. © 2018, American Society of Plant Biologists. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Interplay between the apoptosis, DNA damage, and oxidative stress as a host response to dengue viral infections remains unclear. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from 60 dengue infected patients, 20 patients with febrile illness other than dengue (OFI) and 10 non-febrile illness (NFI) patients. DNA damage in the PBMCs was assessed using single cell gel electrophoresis and stages of apoptosis underwent by the PBMCs were studied by Annexin–PI staining using flow cytometry. Plasma levels of malondialdehyde levels were estimated using thiobarbituric acid assay. Dengue infected individuals had showed increased DNA damage than NFI and OFI controls at the time of admission. Annexin–PI staining revealed increased frequency of apoptotic cells in dengue infected PBMCs than controls during the admission time. Similar pattern was observed in samples collected around defervescence. Within the dengue cases, percentage of live cells was higher in non-severe dengue than severe dengue at both the time points. Follow-up samples in dengue showed less number of live cells and higher percentage of apoptotic cells with respect to their baseline and this was reversed in case of OFI. Plasma malondialdehyde levels were found to be relatively higher in dengue cases than controls at admission and around defervescence. Significant positive correlation between DNA damage, apoptosis, and plasma malondialdehyde levels might pave a way for understanding the complex interactions between virus and hosts response thereby aids in identifying plausible immunopathological links contributing to disease pathogenesis. © 2018 IUBMB Life, 70(11):1133–1143, 2018. © 2018 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology},

High-resolution transmission electron microscopic (HR-TEM) analysis revealed the conversion 1-D nanostructures of PTCA to spherical aggregates with Cu2+ and hexagonal prisms with Pb2+ ions. However, Ag+ ions were reduced to silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) at higher pH. The concentration dependent studies showed detection of both metal ions up to µM concentration level. Interference studies suggested good selectivity for both Cu2+ and Pb2+ ions at neutral pH in presence of other metal cations.

abstract={Synthesis of mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride (MGCN) by soft template method is still challenging and its application as an electrode material for supercapacitor remains unexplored. Herein, we introduce MGCN as an electrode material for supercapacitors. MGCN is synthesized by facile direct carbonization of methylolated surfactant-polymer composite and bulk graphitic carbon nitride (BGCN) is synthesized under similar condition but in the absence of surfactant. MGCN displays excellent capacitance properties in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte with a specific capacitance as high as 279 F g−1 at a current density of 0.25 A g−1. It also exhibits good rate capability and outstanding cycling stability with excellent coulombic efficiency of 100% over 5000 cycles. This superior capacitive storage performance is attributed to the high surface area, easily accessible mesopores and high pyridinic nitrogen content. High surface area and uniform pores of MGCN provide more active sites for charge storage and reduce diffusion path length for ions while high pyridinic nitrogen enhanced the overall specific capacitance by surface Faradaic reaction. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

abstract={The discharges from industries particularly petroleum industry at any stage from exploration/drilling to transportation are of major environmental concerns in the present scenario. In this work, mesoporous silica (SBA-15) was modified using a bio-inspired coating and was used as filler in the fabrication of efficient, robust polyetherimide composite ultrafiltration membranes. The membranes prepared by this facile two-step approach were seen to be highly hydrophilic with improved porosity and pore-interconnectivity with a thinner skin layer. The rougher top surfaces of these membranes imparted an oleophobic character under water. The composite membranes exhibited improved emulsion/water flux while maintaining >99.8% rejection of oil from a synthetic motor oil/water/surfactant emulsion. The composite membranes were investigated for its long-term efficiency in the removal of oil from produced water. The flux declination was only <15% for up to 9 h with three intermittent backwashes and the oil/grease content of the permeate was lower than 10 ppm, well below the discharge limits. A significant improvement in antimicrobial characteristic was found to be achieved by the composite membranes against the gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis) and gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria. The results from this study indicate that the polydopamine decorated SBA-15incorporatedpolyetherimide membranes hold a promising potential to be employed for oil-water emulsion separation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This paper explores the spatial coverage potential of a vision sensor to implement a dual service for a museum security system. Services include object monitoring and invisible visual Multiple-Input and Multiple-Output (MIMO) communication. For object monitoring, the Kalman filter algorithm is used. To implement a secret visual MIMO communication, an Adaptive Row-Column (ARC)-based LSB substitution technique is used along with the Integer Wavelet Transform method. These proposed services are implemented using existing electronic visual displays and surveillance cameras. Experiments are carried out using a sample object and four stego images. The performance of the object tracking system is measured in terms of accuracy by comparing the actual and estimated position of an object. Similarly, the performance of the covert visual MIMO system is measured at two different stages. On the transmitter side, differences between the cover and stego-images are used to measure imperceptibility. Likewise, at the receiver, differences between the original and the reconstructed data images are used to measure the accuracy. Results illustrate that the proposed system has improved imperceptibility, accuracy, and robustness, as compared to existing techniques. © 2018 by the author.},

abstract={Abnormal conduction and improper electrical impulse propagation are common in heart after myocardial infarction (MI). The scar tissue is non-conductive therefore the electrical communication between adjacent cardiomyocytes is disrupted. In the current study, we synthesized and characterized a conductive biodegradable scaffold by incorporating graphene oxide gold nanosheets (GO-Au) into a clinically approved natural polymer chitosan (CS). Inclusion of GO-Au nanosheets in CS scaffold displayed two fold increase in electrical conductivity. The scaffold exhibited excellent porous architecture with desired swelling and controlled degradation properties. It also supported cell attachment and growth with no signs of discrete cytotoxicity. In a rat model of MI, in vivo as well as in isolated heart, the scaffold after 5 weeks of implantation showed a significant improvement in QRS interval which was associated with enhanced conduction velocity and contractility in the infarct zone by increasing connexin 43 levels. These results corroborate that implantation of novel conductive polymeric scaffold in the infarcted heart improved the cardiac contractility and restored ventricular function. Therefore, our approach may be useful in planning future strategies to construct clinically relevant conductive polymer patches for cardiac patients with conduction defects.},

Interestingly, 3 showed strong fluorescence in solution (λmax = 489–540 nm, Φf = 0.337–0.018 compared to standard fluorescein) as well as solid state (λmax = 553 nm, Φf = 4.84% (absolute quantum yield) whereas structurally similar 4 did not show fluorescence. Further 3 also showed reversible mechanofluorochromism (MFC) due to the incorporation of non-planar TPA. Solid state structural analysis confirmed intramolecular H-bonding in 3 and 4 but 3 showed coplanar conformation between TPA phenyl and imine group whereas one of the molecules in the asymmetric unit of 4 revealed slightly twisted conformation. Powder X-ray diffraction studies of 3 indicated reversible conversion of crystalline to amorphous and vice versa. Computational studies of 3 and 4 provided insight on the ESIPT properties of 3. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={With the increase in the amount of data transferred online, there is an increasing requirement of security. Steganography is one field of data encryption which focuses on hiding a secret message inside a cover image. A normal person intercepting the image would not be able to identify the secret message. This paper proposes a new algorithm which performs a variation of LSB substitution method in the spatial domain, where the cover image is split into various sub-images and data embedding is done on the sub-images individually. Two LSB embedding methods which operate using three threshold values are also proposed and a key matrix identifies which one of the two methods is to be applied to each of the sub-images. The results and analysis show that the proposed technique is more secure with high PSNR values and is resistant to steganalysis. It is also found that the proposed algorithm has high data embedding capacity. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Background: IL-23/Th17 signaling pathway plays a crucial role in the cell-mediated immune response against bacterial infections and also in the pathogenesis of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Recent studies indicate that Th17 cell-associated cytokines are involved in the progression and maintenance of valvular lesions in rheumatic heart disease (RHD). Variants in the genes of cytokines that are potentially involved in Th17 response may influence interindividual differences in their expression levels, thereby contributing to the pathogenesis of immune-mediated diseases such as RHD. Objective: The aim of the study is to investigate the association of IL17A, IL17F, and IL23R gene variants with the risk perception of RHD. Methods: A total of 225 individuals (99 RHD patients and 126 healthy siblings) were recruited for the study. The IL17A (rs2275913), IL17F (rs763780), and IL23R (rs10889677) polymorphisms were determined by polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphisms and amplification-refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction methods, respectively. Results: The frequency of IL17A (rs2275913) A/A genotype was significantly high in pooled RHD patients (odds ratio [OR] = 2.76; pc = 0.021), rheumatic fever (RF) patients (OR = 14.5; pc = 0.0001), and mitral valvular lesions patients (OR = 2.74; pc = 0.039) when compared to healthy siblings. However, the IL17F (rs763780) and IL23R (rs10889677) polymorphisms did not show any association with RHD. Conclusions: The results suggest that IL17A (rs2275913) polymorphism is associated with the development of RF/RHD in South Indian population. Further studies are required to substantiate the association of these genes with the disease risk. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={The usage of smart phones by Indian students is tremendously growing at faster pace. To cope with the high-end demand, mobile manufacturers have to make rational decisions regarding the market expansion and quality improvement. To critical decision, in this paper, a new scientific decision framework called SPMS is (smart phone manufacturer selector) presented. The SPMS consist of three stages viz., data acquisition and pre-processing stage, data fusion and criteria weighting stage and selection/ranking stage. The data is collected from questionnaires which are completed by students of colleges in and around Thanjavur district. The missing information in the dataset are completed using bin by mean method, followed by feature set reduction is done using Gini index method. In the second stage, linguistic information are aggregated using frequency match aggregation (FMA) operator with unconstrained weight values. Further, criteria weights are determined using standard variance (SV) method under linguistic context. Finally, ranking of smart phone manufacturers is done using VIKOR method under linguistic context. The practicality and usefulness of the proposed framework is demonstrated using a case study for smart phone selection. The strength and weakness of the proposal is also realized by comparison with other state-of-art frameworks. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={In India, agro-food by-products such as shell cake of cashew nut (Anacardium occidentale L.), shell of coconut (Cocos nucifera L.) and hull of groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) are cheaply available on a vast scale. Even though a small portion of these solid waste materials is being used, a large quantity is not being utilized. Based on literature data, these by-products could be used as a source of valuable phytochemicals. The present study explored a suitable solvent system and extraction conditions for the recovery of polyphenols from three different agro-food by-products. The optimal conditions for the recovery of polyphenols from agro-food by-products were investigated in addition to evaluating their antioxidant and antibacterial properties. Among the three investigated by-products, methanolic extract of cashew nut shell was the most prominent source of antioxidants (3412.28 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/L) compared to coconut shell (1056.32 mg GAE/L) and groundnut hull (426.35 mg GAE/L). The in vitro antioxidant assay produced promising radical scavenging activity of shell extract of coconut (concentration at which the response was reduced by half; IC50 = 12 μg/mL) compared to cashew nut (IC50 = 44 μg/mL) and groundnut hull extract (IC50 = 48 μg/mL). The anti-bacterial activity of different solvent extracts revealed that the methanolic extracts from cashew nut and coconut shells were more effective in inhibiting the growth of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The present work revealed the possibility of recovery of useful phytochemical compounds from agro-food byproducts which could be used subsequently as natural food preservatives. © 2018 Kasetsart University},

abstract={In this android era, the word spectrum is connected with trillion faces. The underutilization problem of the spectrum in most of the applications results in the paucity of this scarce resource. Cognitive radio (CR) is an astute technology implemented for the opportunistic usage of idle spectrum resource dynamically. This paper focuses on sensing of the vacant channels, and it is pre-owned for the transmission of encrypted DICOM information. The proposed algorithm involves encryption schemes like RC5, Latin square image cipher, deoxyribo nucleic acid, and discrete Gould transform (DGT) to render confusion, diffusion, and permutation operations. Further, the uncorrelated cipher image is transmitted via the identified unused licensed spectrum. The proposed scheme guarantees the authorised transactions among the stack holders like patients, doctors, and hospital management systems. It also ascertains and enhances the validation of the cipher biomedical interactions among peers by assuring tamper proofing using DGT. Simulations have been conceded over universal software radio peripheral to validate the biomedical data transactions after sensing the unused spectrum. Metrics like global-local entropies, correlation coefficients, key sensitivity, chi-square tests, cropping attacks and differential attack analysis were estimated to authenticate the robustness of the projected encryption scheme. © 2009-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Experimental investigation is under taken in the present work to understand the corrosion mechanism of sinter-forged Fe-0.5%C, Fe-0.5%C-1%Cr and Fe-0.5%C-2%Cr low alloy steels. Aqueous immersion and electrochemical corrosion tests were conducted on the forged alloys using 18% HCl acid solution for various timings to simulate the pickling corrosion. Weight loss measurement was made on the corroded specimens. Corrosion rate is found to decrease drastically with increase in percentage theoretical density irrespective of the alloy compositions. It is found from the results that addition of Cr enhances the corrosion resistance of the alloy steels. The enhanced hardness of the densified alloy steel specimen improves the corrosive resistance of the alloy steel. Corrosion rates were determined using Tafel plots in the case of electrochemical corrosion. Microstructure of the forged alloys revealed the presence of numerous fine rounded pores both within the grains and along the grain boundaries. SEM and XRD were taken for all the compositions and correlated with the corrosion behaviour of the alloy steels. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim},

As-prepared AuNPs was immobilised on carbon paste electrode and subjected to electrochemical sensing of an important neurotransmitter dopamine. Differential pulse voltammetry studies revealed sensitive and selective determination of dopamine in the presence of commonly interfering ascorbic acid and uric acid. The linear detection range was 10-600 μM and the limit of detection was 0.7 ± 0.18 μM. The practical application was demonstrated by measuring dopamine in human blood serum and urine samples. The catalytic activity of AuNPs was evaluated by sodium borohydride mediated reduction of nitroaromatic compounds. The reduction kinetics was found to be pseudo-first-order kinetics.

abstract={Growing demand for e-healthcare across the globe has raised concerns towards the secure and authentication enhanced medical image sharing. One of the services offered by health informatics in hospitals include an user interface through the Local Area Network (LAN) for enabling storage and access of medical records. In this paper, a security enhanced DICOM image sharing over a LAN addressing confidentiality, integrity and authentication has been proposed. Initially, the AES encrypted patient history was combined along with the thumb impression and Quick Response (QR) code of patient ID as watermark. This watermark was encrypted employing Integer Wavelet Transform (IWT), chaotic map and attractors with confusion-diffusion operations. Further, the encrypted watermark was embedded in the selected Region Of Non-Interest (RONI) pixels of DICOM image. Username & unique password credentials, Face identification and FPGA generated One Time Password (OTP) form the three layer authentication scheme for secure DICOM image access through the LAN. Web publishing medium of storing secured DICOM images in cloud has also been addressed in this work. To validate the proposed hybrid crypto-watermarking system, parameters such as key sensitivity, key space, correlation, entropy, histogram, cropping attack, Mean Square Error (MSE), Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Metric (SSIM) were performed and the results obtained have proved the strength of the proposed algorithm against brute force, statistical and cropping attacks. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={In this paper, an experimental campaign was carried out to assess the impact failure strength of steel hybrid fibre reinforced concrete (SHFRC) subjected to freezing–thawing cycles in water containing 4.0% solution of NaCl. For this purpose, six different concrete mixtures were prepared by adding long and short steel fibres at 2.0% volume of concrete. The proportion of long to short straight steel fibres, also called as the hybrid fibre coefficient (HFC) of SHFRC, used in this study are 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1.0. All the specimens were subjected to freezing–thawing of 0, 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175 and 200 cycles followed by impact test using pendulum impact device. Significant weight loss was observed in SHFRC specimens exposed to freezing–thawing cycles (0–200). Also, an analytical model was developed to assess the impact failure strength of SHFRC subjected to freezing–thawing cycles. The results revealed that when the number of freezing–thawing cycles were increased, the loss in weight of SHFRC specimens was increased and the impact failure strength of SHFRC specimens was decreased. The impact failure strength of SHFRC incorporating higher amount of long fibres was higher compared to short fibres, which implies that long fibre plays a predominant role in enhancing its impact failure strength. © 2018, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals.},

abstract={Aqueous extract of nut by-products (cashewnut shell, coconut shell, and peanut hull) were studied for their physicochemical properties, antibacterial activity and food preservation potential in an artificially inoculated fresh-cut fruit (papaya) model.

The antibacterial property of the extracts evaluated by zone of inhibition assay revealed that cashew nut shell extract had a strong inhibition effect on Escherichia coli (18 mm), Listeria monocytogenes (18 mm), and Salmonella enterica (16 mm). Food preservative effect of extracts was examined in an artificially inoculated fresh-cut papaya model, and both cashewnut and coconut shell extracts significantly reduced the population of the above mentioned foodborne pathogens. However, when compared to coconut shell extract, the application of cashewnut shell extract was found to affect the sensory property of the fresh-cut fruit as darkening of the cut fruit was observed.

abstract={Using ab initio calculation, structural stability, including electronic properties of bare/hydrogenated stanene (BSn/HSn) nanosheet, was explored. The geometrical stability of HSn material is verified with the influence of phonon band structure and formation energy. The concentration of the present work is to check the quality of Musa acuminata (banana) fruits when it is in ripe and overripe stage using HSn nanosheet material. Further, the interaction of different volatile organic compounds, namely, isoamyl acetate, isobutyl acetate, acetoin, and 2,3-butanediol aromas on HSn base material is studied with the significant parameter such as Bader charge transfer, band gap, adsorption energy, and average energy band gap changes. The sensitivity of the aromas emitting from ripe and overripe stages of banana on HSn nanosheet was studied using density of states spectrum. The adsorption energy of HSn nanosheet is found in the range of − 0.055 to − 0.989 eV upon the interaction VOCs of Musa acuminata. The novel aspect of the present work is to check the quality of Musa acuminata with the influence of HSn nanosheet using density functional theory. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Soil erosion and its impact on the land and surface water resources are posing both ecological and socioeconomic threats around the world. In South India, tank systems are quite ancient, supporting rural livelihood including their agricultural needs. But, in recent decades they have lost their significance. The aggravated catchment erosion and resultant siltation have significantly reduced their storage capacity and thereby their functionality. Ambuliyar sub-basin, encompassing 809 irrigation tanks, has once satisfied multifunctional needs of people but now becomes degraded due to siltation. Though desilting of tanks and feeder channels is practiced, the tanks often get silted owing to aggravate soil erosion. Hence, to sustain their life span, it is essential to minimize the erosion in the catchment. Thus, the present study intends to estimate the rate of erosion, analyze their spatial variation through a time series analysis, and ascertain the causative factor. Accordingly, the annual soil loss estimated using Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation method has shown an increase in the rate of erosion from 4084.40 (1996) to 4922.47 t ha−1 y−1 (2016). However, spatially, a non-uniform pattern is inferred, and hence based on the variations, the sub-basin is divided into five zones. In zones I, II, and V, there is an increase in erosion, and in zones III and IV, a decrease is witnessed. Variations studied in conjunction with RUSLE parameters reveal that the improper land use practice has modified the erosion rate and pattern. Further, it is presumed that the silted watercourses might have increased the overland flow, which in turn increased the erosion. Remedial measures such as afforestation, promotion of coconut plantation, and reduction in overland flow by desilting tanks are suggested; thereby, the surface and groundwater resources will be enhanced and in turn the agricultural productivity. © 2018, Institute of Geophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences & Polish Academy of Sciences.},

abstract={We report on the basis of density functional theory, the field emission properties of pristine and doped aluminum nanocone (Al-NC). We substituted the apex of the Al-NC with group IV and group V elements, namely arsenic (As), germanium (Ge) and phosphorous (P) atoms and had carried out studies on these nanocone structures. The density of states (DOS) spectrum gives a clear perception of the charge distribution over the Al-NC surface on doping. Furthermore, the Richardson-Dushman formula has been used to correlate the work function Φ and the charge density. We have observed that doping at the apex of Al-NC leads to the variation in work function Φ. The results show that the field emission properties of Al-NC can be improved with the substitution of As, Ge, and P at the apex of the structure. Our findings suggest that doping of the Al-NC with Ge, As and P leads to the improved field emission properties, which can be used for nanoelectronics and vacuum electronics. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The geometric stability of silicane layer (H-Si) is explored using the first-principles investigation. The electronic properties of H-Si are ascertained, and tunable electronic properties of H-Si leads to the application in sequencing the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)/riboxy nucleic acid (RNA). The adsorption behavior of DNA/RNA nucleobases on H-Si is explored using Bader charge transfer, adsorption energy, and energy gap. Moreover, there is a significant change in the band structure and density of states of H-Si upon adsorption of nucleobases. We observed that all the nucleobases are physisorbed on H-Si via van der Waals interaction. The adsorption of nucleobases on H-Si is in the order G > C > A = T > U. The findings of the result demonstrate that H-Si can be used to identify the nucleobases, which can be used for DNA/RNA sequencing in medical science and biotechnology. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The expanded utilization of variable recurrence drives brings about more harmonics and Inter harmonics on the supply side. This affects the sensitive loads that are connected to the same supply. To mitigate harmonics and Inter harmonics, a new method is proposed in this work. In this work, an isolated zeta converter is used in the dc link to control the DC link current which is functioning in intermittent conduction method. This converter controls the dc input voltage to the voltage source inverter. Zeta converter has inherent power factor correction with the single voltage sensor, and it reduces harmonics and Inter harmonics on the supply side. Model reference adaptive system (MRAS) technique is employed to control the speed of the initiation motor to attain well motor presentation. In MRAS, speed is expected by associating reference mode and adaptive mode. The proposed work is simulated in MATLAB/Simulink, and the fallouts are accessible. In this work, introduces a new advanced technology in which embedded scheme is included into the WSN based on MRAS technique. During this process, different sensors have connected to the motor, and the values are extracted using a microcontroller. It’s then transmitting to the base station through wireless communication, and at the base station, a Graphical User Interface with cloud server (IoT) given which provide the client can interface with the framework by using MRAS algorithm. The simulated results are verified with experimentally. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Electroencephalogram (EEG) sign is the recording of impulsive electrical interest of the mind over a small period of time. Signals are made through attack of neurons in the brains that are measured and calculated through EEG. EEG indicators are low voltage indicators that are contaminated with the aid of various types of noises that are additionally known as artifacts. As these alerts are used to diagnose diverse varieties of mind related diseases like narcolepsy, Sleep apneasyndrome, Insomnia and parasomnia it will become necessary to make those indicators free from noise for correct evaluation and detection of the sicknesses. Various noise elimination strategies together with ICA-Independent Component Analysis, PCA-Principle Component Analysis, Wavelet packet transform and Wavelet Packet Transform are to be had and can be carried out in mat lab. All these strategies may be used for EEG signal de-noising through noise to the original sign and then put in force the noise reduction method and their overall performance can be evaluated based on the elements which includes SNR and MSE. In this article, an arithmetical method for putting off artifacts from EEG demos via wavelet packet transform without thinking about SNR calculation is proposed. © 2018, Advanced Scientific Research.

abstract={Spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) is essential and plays a vital role in many natural phenomena, including the formation of the Turing pattern in organisms and complex patterns in brain dynamics. In this work, we investigate whether a set of coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators can exhibit spontaneous symmetry breaking when the oscillators are interacting through dissimilar variables or conjugate coupling. We find the emergence of the SSB state with coexisting distinct dynamical states in the parametric space and show how the system transits from symmetry breaking state to out-of-phase synchronized (OPS) state while admitting multistabilities among the dynamical states. Further, we also investigate the effect of the feedback factor on SSB as well as oscillation quenching states and we point out that the decreasing feedback factor completely suppresses SSB and oscillation death states. Interestingly, we also find that the feedback factor completely diminishes only symmetry breaking oscillation and oscillation death (OD) states but it does not affect the nontrivial amplitude death (NAD) state. Finally, we have deduced the analytical stability conditions for in-phase and out-of-phase oscillations, as well as amplitude and oscillation death states. © CopyrightEPLA, 2018.},

abstract={Co/Co-N nanoparticles incorporated nitrogen-doped nanoporous carbon (Co/Co-N@NPC) nanostructures were fabricated via pyrolysis of metal organic framework, ZIF-67, under argon atmosphere. The ZIF-67 derived Co/Co-N@NPC modified carbon paste electrode exhibited excellent performance during electroanalysis of dopamine, displaying two linear ranges; 10 nM to 50 μM, and 50 μM–500 μM with sensitivity of 12.4±0.3 μA/μM/cm 2 and11.69±0.06 μA/μM/cm 2 , respectively. The modified electrodes were observed to be highly selective towards dopamine even in presence of other interfering biomolecules such as ascorbic acid, glucose and uric acid. To the best of our knowledge, the sensing ability of Co/Co-N@NPC with a lower limit of detection as 6 nM is the best compared to the previously reported cobalt mediated sensors for dopamine.

abstract={Background: Radiotherapy is the most widely used treatment method for treating cancer with or without surgery and chemotherapy. In lung cancer, it is one of the important treatment steps in excising the tumor from the lung tissue; unfortunately, radiation can induce epithelial- mesenchymal transition (EMT), a typical physiological process in which cuboidal shaped epithelial cell loses its phenotype and acquires mesenchymal-like phenotype thus, increases the metastasis progression in the body. To prevent EMT mediated metastasis, we aimed to 1) synthesize silver nanoparticles by using Gallic acid, a potential antioxidant which acts as stabilizing and reducing agent in the form of silver nanoparticle (GA-AgNPs) 2) to analyze its effect on EMT markers during radiation-induced EMT in A549 cells. Methods: A549 cells were irradiated with 8Gy (X-ray) and treated with GA-AgNPs at a fixed concentration under in vitro condition. GA-AgNPs were prepared and characterized for absorption, potential stability, size and morphology by UV–Visible spectrophotometer, Zeta potential and Transmission electron microscopy respectively. After irradiation, the morphology changes were observed using an inverted microscope, the gene and protein expression of EMT markers were analyzed by RT-PCR and western blotting. Results/conclusion: GA-AgNPs are in nano size with fair stability. The synthesized nanoparticles suppressed the EMT markers including Vimentin, N-cadherin, Snail-1 and increased E-cadherin expression which might inhibit cancer cells to acquire radio resistant metastasis potential. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Abstract: The majority of industrial regions across the globe are polluted due to the release of toxic chemical wastes into the environment. Hence, real-time and continuous environmental monitoring is indispensable to regulate the polluting sources and to evade serious health issues. In this context, polyaniline (PANI) and cadmium oxide (CdO) nanoparticles were synthesized, and subsequently, a PANI–CdO nanocomposite sensing element was fabricated using dip coating technique. Structural, morphological, optical, and room temperature sensing properties of the nanocomposite thin film were investigated using x-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, UV–Vis spectrophotometry, and an electrometer integrated with the custom-made gas testing chamber. PANI–CdO nanocomposite thin film sensor showed a selective response of 1580 towards 100 ppm of methanol with the response and recovery times of 19 s and 41 s, respectively.

abstract={The analysis of acoustic data typically discusses the problem of segmenting the acoustic events into non-overlapping acoustically compact categories. In Acoustic Event Detection (AED), an acoustic event is categorized into speech and non-speech events. Detection of non-speech sounds such as scream, gun shots, explosions, and glass break events is very helpful in acoustic surveillance, multimedia information retrieval, and acoustic forensic applications. In this paper, we propose global statistical features-based representation for multi-variate varying length acoustic data. A discriminative model-based classifier is then used to classify different acoustic events. The proposed representation is of very less dimension. The proposed approach is evaluated on surveillance-oriented AED datasets such as CICESE (recorded from a smart room scenario), Environmental Sound Classification (ESC), and IEEE AASP/DCASE2013 (Office environment) datasets. The proposed approach gives a better performance when compared with the conventional Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) approaches. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Mental fatigue is a typical phenomenon in our everyday life, and is characterized as a condition of cortical deactivation. Mental deactivation produces performance degradation such as human failures, errors and health problems, thereby detaining the quality of life. Various physiological parameters obtained from biosignals have been identified as an indicator of fatigue. The main biosignals that help to detect the mental performance are Electrocardiogram (ECG), Electroencephalogram (EEG) and Electrooculogram (EOG). After acquiring these signals, they undergo various stages of processing which includes signal de-noising, feature extraction and classification for the efficient analysis of mental performance. The paper provides comprehensive review of various approaches involved in processing of biosignals to detect mental fatigue. © 2018, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

abstract={Background Routine application of vascularized composite allotransplantation is hampered by immunosuppression-related health comorbidities. To mitigate these, we developed an inflammation-responsive hydrogel for local immunosuppression. Here, we report on its long-term effect on graft survival, immunological, and toxicological impact. Methods Brown Norway-to-Lewis rat hindlimb transplantations were treated either systemically with daily injections of 1 mg/kg tacrolimus (TAC) or with subcutaneous intragraft injections of hydrogel containing 7 mg TAC, every 70 days. Animals were monitored for rejection or other pathology for 280 days. Systemic and graft TAC levels, regulatory T cells, and donor cell chimerism were measured periodically. At endpoint, markers for kidney, liver, and metabolic state were compared to naive age-matched rats. Results Both daily systemic TAC and subcutaneous intragraft TAC hydrogel at 70-day intervals were able to sustain graft survival longer than 280 days in 5 of 6 recipients. In the hydrogel group, 1 graft progressed to grade 3 rejection at postoperative day 149. In systemic TAC group, 1 animal was euthanized due to lymphoma on postoperative day 275. Hydrogel treatment provided stable graft and reduced systemic TAC levels, and a 4 times smaller total TAC dose compared with systemic immunosuppression. Hydrogel-treated animals showed preserved kidney function, absence of malignancies or opportunistic infections and increased hematopoietic chimerism compared with systemic immunosuppression. Conclusions Our findings demonstrate that localized immunosuppression with TAC hydrogel is a long-term safe and reliable treatment. It may reduce the burden of systemic immunosuppression in vascularized composite allotransplantation, potentially boosting the clinical application of this surgical intervention. © 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

abstract={Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a multifaceted cancer tumor that makes its diagnosis challenging. NPC has a consistently diffusive enlargement that makes its resection exceptionally challenging. The pathological identification of NPC and comparing typical and anomalous tissues require a set of advanced strategies for the extraction of features. The use of medical images to diagnoses NPC tumor depends on tumor shape, region, and intensity. This paper proposes a novel approach for diagnosing NPC from endoscopic images. The approach includes a trainable segmentation for identifying NPC tissues, genetic algorithm for selecting the best features, and support vector machine for classifying NPC. The proposed approach is validated by comparing the number of classified NPC cases against the manual approach of ENT specialists. The approach shows a high precision of 95.15%, sensitivity of 94.80%, and specificity of 95.20%. Additionally, the optimized feature selection provides straightforward and efficient classification results. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={A novel prebiotic, levan, has shown a positive beneficial role as a dietary immune-nutrient in fishes. However, the research investigations on the underlying mechanism of immune protection is unavailable, therefore in the present study we have attempted to reveal the effects of dietary microbial levan on the expression of cytokine genes in the pathogen challenged Labeo rohita fingerlings. Fish were randomly distributed in two treatment group in triplicates, control group fed without levan and treated group fed with 1.25% (w/w%) of microbial levan in the diet. After 60 days of feeding trial, fish from each group were challenged with virulent A. hydrophila strain and tissue samples were collected on different time points, 3 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 96 h. Dietary administration of microbial levan, significantly upregulated the m-RNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-12p40 in the intestine, gill, kidney and liver in a time dependent manner. An increase of 2.13-fold in the expression of IL-1β at 96 h post challenge in the kidney cells was detected, however at early time points (3 h & 6 h) expression of the same was down regulated. Upregulation of the TNF-α gene in the gill, liver and kidney at 6 h and in the intestine at 12 h was noticed. IL-12p40 m-RNA expressed highest upregulation of 3.65-fold at 3 h in the intestine and 2.0-fold at 12 h in the gill. IL-10 m-RNA expression of intestine in the infected L. rohita displayed 7.57-fold downregulation. Furthermore, increased respiratory burst activity and serum lysozyme activity was observed in a time dependent manner in infected rohu fed with levan supplementation. Overall, the current study revealed the upregulation of immune responsive cytokine genes (IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-12p40) with dietary microbial levan against the pathogen infected stress in Labeo rohita fingerlings and thus supports use of levan as food additive in aquaculture. © 2018},

abstract={Different types of fault diagnostic applications that utilize case-based reasoning (CBR) are applied in the diagnosis process. However, CBR cannot provide solutions to unanticipated or unknown problems. Therefore, further investigation of the retrieval and revision mechanisms of CBR is essential in improving the diagnosis accuracy and precision of the method. This study proposes a hybrid scheme that combines the genetic algorithm and CBR (GCBR) to improve CBR diagnosis. CBR applies experience and knowledge on existing cases of fault diagnosis to newly provided cases. The genetic algorithm aggregates and revises relevant cases to provide solutions to unknown cases. GCBR is implemented in a mobile phone fault diagnosis application. This domain is a good testing environment because mobile phones are of various types and models. Test results show that GCBR can detect several mobile phone faults with average accuracy 98.7%. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Oxidative stress response in bacteria is mediated through coordination between the regulators of oxidant-remediation systems (e.g. OxyR, SoxR) and nucleoid condensation (e.g. Dps, Fis). However, these genetic factors are either absent or rendered non-functional in the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Therefore, how Mtb organizes genome architecture and regulates gene expression to counterbalance oxidative imbalance is unknown. Here, we report that an intracellular redox-sensor, WhiB4, dynamically links genome condensation and oxidative stress response in Mtb. Disruption of WhiB4 affects the expression of genes involved in maintaining redox homeostasis, central metabolism, and respiration under oxidative stress. Notably, disulfide-linked oligomerization of WhiB4 in response to oxidative stress activates the protein's ability to condense DNA. Further, overexpression of WhiB4 led to hypercondensation of nucleoids, redox imbalance and increased susceptibility to oxidative stress, whereas WhiB4 disruption reversed this effect. In accordance with the findings in vitro, ChIP-Seq data demonstrated non-specific binding of WhiB4 to GC-rich regions of the Mtb genome. Lastly, data indicate that WhiB4 deletion affected the expression of ~ 30% of genes preferentially bound by the protein, suggesting both direct and indirect effects on gene expression. We propose that WhiB4 structurally couples Mtb's response to oxidative stress with genome organization and transcription. © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={Hypertension results due to dysfunction of different metabolic pathways leading to the increased risk of cerebral ischemia, atherosclerosis, cardiovascular and inflammatory disorders. Hypertension has been considered a one of the major contributors to metabolic syndrome and is often referred to as a ‘silent killer’. Its incidence is on the rise across the globe owing to the drastic life style changes. The diagnosis of hypertension had been traditionally carried out through measurement of systolic and diastolic blood pressure but in most cases, this form of diagnosis is too late and the disease has already caused organ damage. Therefore, early detection of hypertension by monitoring subtle changes in specific biochemical markers from body fluids can minimize the risk of organ damage. However, a single marker may be insufficient for accurate diagnosis of hypertension thereby necessitating quantification of multiple markers. Concerted efforts to identify key markers for hypertension and their quantification, especially using chemical and biosensors, are underway in different parts of the world. Constant evolution of the sensing elements and transduction strategies have contributed to significant improvements in the diagnosis field, especially in the context of sensitivity, response time and selectivity and this when applied to the detection of hypertension markers may prove beneficial. This review summarizes advances in the field of sensor technology towards the detection of biologically relevant entities, arrays and the next generation ‘lab-on-a-chip’ systems for hypertension. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Breast cancer is one of the most common and serious threat around worldwide for women. It is necessary to prognosis of Histopathology image in order to avoid death rate also early detection is required for the best treatment. Histopathology refers to the examination of biopsy sample by a pathologist under microscope. The pathologist locates, analyze and classify the image type and grade the image. The classification depends on structure of tissue, cell distribution, and shape of the cell which decides the histopathology image as benign or malignant. Manual classification of image is most time consuming and prone to error. To overcome this difficulty automated diagnosis using machine learning is needed for accurate and early diagnosis. In this paper k-means clustering is used for segmentation of cell nuclei and DWT (Discrete Wavelet Transform) is applied to the segmented image. Coiflets is one of the discrete wavelets used in this paper it has scaling functions with vanishing moments. Energy, shannon entropy and log energy entropy features are extracted from the LL, LH, HL and HH sub bands. In the present work we have used BreakHis (The Breast Cancer Histopathological Images) dataset. The proposed method result in a accuracy of 93.3% in linear SVM and 92.7% in Quadratic SVM and 91.3% in Fine Gaussian SVM. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={With increasing amounts of digital audio content creators, there is a need for ownership assertion to be stronger. In this work, we have proposed a new algorithm for embedding a creator-provided image inside an audio signal. The algorithm distorts the image using DNA-Encoding and DNA Addition, followed by symmetric encryption based on AES, prior to embedding in pseudorandom LSB positions of the discrete audio signal. The proposed algorithm is implemented and tested with standard benchmark images. The results obtained are analyzed with the following metrics namely PSNR, MSE and NCC. It has produced an imperceptible audio and can be claimed to provide a robust watermarked audio that can survive against signal processing attacks hence more desirable and appropriate for many practical applications that demands copyright protection features. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={The phenomenon of cloud storage is to keep enormous amount of data available given by the user. The user has to be assured that the integrity of the data stored is intact. In order to ensure the integrity of the data, we have come up with a new scheme called an enhanced data possession checking using Identity Based Signature. In the earlier existing approaches, the time taken for key exchange is not considered because of which the efficiency of the overall working model is reduced. By introducing this scheme, the data that is stored using Merkle Hash Tree can avoid the waiting time as the user can generate his/her own public key using the Identity Based Signature. The Merkle Hash Tree is constructed and the root is evaluated by both cloud service provider and the data owner. In order to check the integrity of the data, the data owner asks for a specific block which returns the axillary path along with the file asked. The root computation is done and the external verifier compares the roots. The efficiency and the security of this new scheme is evaluated by both theoretical analyzing and simulation experiments. The obtained solution proves that our proposed scheme is secure and efficient. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={A unique modest approach to obtain low energy, few-cycle laser pulses at 800 nm through chloroform filled cascaded photonic crystal fiber (PCF) is theoretically presented. Temperature is considered as the control parameter in designing the cascaded PCF to compress femtosecond pulses using higher order soliton compression scheme. The temperature-dependent parameters of both fiber and the infiltrated chloroform liquid are utilized to solve the modified nonlinear Schrödinger equation that facilitates the engineering of ultrashort pulses. Through this method, cascaded PCF could be designed using a single fiber for the generation of short pulses with minimal pedestal energy deprived of any other supplementary modules. We numerically prove that the compression of pulses from an input pulse of 140 fs up to 6.98 fs is possible by using temperature-controlled PCF. The designed fiber compressor is estimated to provide the possible compression factor of 20.05, quality factor of 0.49, output energy of 4.81 pJ, with 50.81% of pedestal energy, through 2.4 cm of entire length. © 2018 Author(s).},

abstract={We have studied the effect of duty cycle variation in the Fibonacci optical superlattice (FOS) structure by analysing the second harmonic generation (SHG) spectrum. Unlike periodic quasi-phase matching (QPM) device, the variation in duty cycle changes the SHG spectrum asymmetrically. The higher intensity and other multiple peaks in the spectrum change asymmetrically when the duty ratio varies away from 0.5. As a result, the SHG spectrum of lower and higher duty ratios from the ideal FOS device generates multiple dissimilar peaks as it was observed from entirely different QPM devices. However, the main phase matching peak shows symmetric nature, irrespective of the duty cycle variation like the periodic one. Further, we have analysed the correlation spectrum to prove the asymmetric nature of the FOS SHG spectrum. Although FOS device exhibits asymmetric spectral nature in duty cycle variation, it shows the same optical interaction regardless of the pump direction. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

The objective of this paper is to design an efficient, non isolated DC-DC converter. The proposed design consists of a two- phase interleaved boost converter with a flyback stage coupled to one of its phases. The primary features of the topology are continuous input current, moderate duty ration operation, and relatively reduced device stresses.

abstract={With the emergence of various Distributed Generation (DG) Units, the modern power system has undergone massive structural changes. The increase in system load is a gradual and inevitable process over time. This leads to increase in the system losses. The effect of increase in system load can be counteracted by the presence of optimally allocated DG units and can also defer further investment of reinforcement in the system. In this paper, the DG allocation is performed by Genetic Algorithm (GA) method in two-steps. The main objectives of DG allocation in this paper has been considered as (i) a single objective namely Loss Minimization and (ii) a multi-objective function namely Maximizing Voltage Stability margin and Loss minimization. Economic analysis on contribution of each factor towards the cost of energy over a period of seven years is performed. Such analysis gives an idea to the system planner, in calculating the breakeven point and investment on reinforcement. The results obtained for the standard IEEE 33 bus radial distribution system have been presented, giving a promising insight for future investments. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Inverters play a major role in converting the DC power obtained from renewable energy resources into AC. Conventional inverters produce a square wave with a THD of 48.34%. To reduce harmonics, multilevel inverters are a better option than large-sized L-C filters. Increased number of levels results in an output with close resemblance to a sine wave. But, increase in levels increases the number of switches and control complexity. So, a balance has to be struck between the THD in the output and the number of components to be used. This paper proposes a novel topology with a reduced number of switches, to obtain a similar performance to that of existing cascaded Hbridge configurations, which use Carrier-Based Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation (CBSPWM) technique. The designed power and pulse generator circuit are validated by simulation and the outputs are presented. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Conventional converters provide gain at the cost of high duty ratio operation, increased switch stress, increased control complexity and lossy power conversion. A non-isolated high gain DC-DC converter with two interleaved flyback stages is presented. The interleaved stage adopts a voltage lift capacitor to enhance the output voltage in the base stage of the converter. The secondary state consists of the secondary windings of the inductor in series to the output of the primary stage. This arrangement provides high gain without extreme duty ratio operation. The simulation results for a design of 100W, 24V/480V is presented which validate the feasibility of the proposed converter. This converter is a proposed to be used as a viable alternative in HID lamp and automobile applications. The hardware verification of the proposed converter is underway. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={The recent advances in the molecular device fabrication have outstretched the exciting applications in vapor sensing devices. This report investigates the explosive vapor detection using the antimonene molecular device (AMD) implemented with the first-principles study. The adsorption of four different explosive vapors namely hexanitrostilbene, M-dinitrobenzene, picric acid, and 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene on AMD device is examined. The adsorption configurations, charge transfer, band gap variation of antimonene nanosheet upon adsorption of explosive vapors on AMD are studied. The adsorption of vapors on AMD device is supported with the transmission spectrum and current-voltage features. Further, the results suggest that next-generation nanosensor is conceivable using antimonene nanosheets. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In many natural systems, attractive coupling together with repulsive coupling plays a vital role in determining their evolutionary dynamics. We investigate the stabilization of amplitude chimera through repulsive coupling in the presence of attractive coupling in a system of nonlocally coupled oscillators. The nonlocal repulsive coupling can facilitate the emergence of stable amplitude chimera even for random initial conditions contrasting with the earlier investigations, where the amplitude chimera was observed just as a transient state and that too for a specific cluster initial conditions. The stability of the observed amplitude chimera is analyzed using Floquet theory. To elucidate the transition among the distinct dynamical states, we find the average number of inhomogeneous oscillators as a function of the coupling strength and show that the transition among the dynamical states exhibits hysteresis. Further, we deduce analytically the critical stability curve that separates the oscillatory (amplitude chimera and traveling wave) states from the death (multi-incoherent oscillation death, cluster chimera death, cluster oscillation death) states. We also analyze the influence of the nonisochronicity parameter and noise on the stable amplitude chimera. We report that the nonisochronicity parameter favors the traveling wave state from incoherent death through the stable amplitude chimera state. © 2018 American Physical Society.},

In this paper, an image processing system for automatic segmentation and yield prediction of fruits is proposed on the basis of color and shape features is being performed. Initially the preprocessing is done on input fruit tree images. Then it is converted from RGB to HSV color space to detect the fruit region from its background. Color thresholding is used to mask the desired colors. Gaussian filter is used to remove noise. The contour of the image is taken. Then these images are processed by image processing algorithm. Color and shape based counting of fruit is presented at the output. The edge detection and combination of a circular fitting algorithm is applied for the automatic segmentation and automatic counting of fruits in the image. Different types of fruits (orange/tangerine, pomegranate, apple, lemon, mango, cherry) are used for automatic counting. Open CV Python software is used to perform the required image processing operations. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={C20 is the most important fullerene cage and alanine is the simplest representation of a backbone unit of the protein. The absorption feasibility of alanine molecule in the Si-doped C20 and B-doped C20 fullerenes has been studied based on calculated electronic properties of fullerenes using density functional theory (DFT). In this work, we explore the ability of Si-doped C20, B-doped C20 fullerene to interact with alanine at the DFT-B3LYP/6-31G, RHF level of theory. We find that noticeable structural change takes place in C20 when one of its carbon is substituted with Si or B. The molecular geometry, electronic properties and vibrational analysis have also been performed on the title compounds. The NMR study reveals the aromaticity of the pure and doped fullerene compounds. Stability of the doped fullerene – alanine compound arises from hyper conjugative interactions. It leads to one of the major property of bioactivity, charge transfer and delocalization of charge and this properties has been analyzed using Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analysis. The energy gap of the doped fullerene reveals that there is a decrease in the size of energy gap significantly, making them more reactive as compared to C20 fullerene. Theoretical studies of the electronic spectra by using time – dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) method were helpful to interpret the observed electronic transition state. We aim to optimize the performance of the solar cells by altering the frontier orbital energy gaps. Considering all studied properties, it may be inferred that the applicability of C20 fullerene as the non-linear optical (NLO) material and its NLO property would increase on doping fullerene with Si and B atom. Specifically C19Si would be better among them. © 2018},

The specimens were cured for 24 h at room temperature and then tested in a universal Instron testing machine, model 5582, at 298 K (25°C). Findings: The fracture surface was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) under an acceleration voltage of 15 kV.

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the performance of powder-mixed electric discharge machining (PMEDM) using three different powders which are aluminium (Al), silicon carbide (SiC) and aluminium oxide (Al2O3). Besides that, the influence of different tool materials was also studied in this experimental investigation. Hence, the work material selected for this purpose was AISI P20 steel and tool materials were copper, brass and tungsten. The performance measures considered in this work were material removal rate (MRR), tool wear rate and radial over cut (ROC). Design/methodology/approach: The process variables considered in this study were powder types, powder concentration, tool materials, peak current and pulse on time. The experimental design, based on Taguchi’s L27 orthogonal array, was adopted to conduct experiments. Significant parameters were identified by performing the analysis of variance on the experimental data. Findings: Based on the analysis of results, it was observed that copper tool combined with Al powder produced maximum MRR (58.35 mm3/min). Similarly, the Al2O3 powder combined with tungsten tool has resulted least ROC (0.04865 mm). It was also observed that wear rate of tungsten tool was very low (0.0145 mm3/min). Originality/value: The experimental investigation of PMEDM involving three different powders (Al, SiC and Al2O3) was not attempted before. Moreover, the study of influence of different tool materials (Cu, brass and W) together with the different powders on the electric discharge machining performance was very limited. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Design/methodology/approach: In this work, experiments were carried out as per the Taguchi experimental design and an L27 orthogonal array was used to study the influence of various combinations of process parameters on surface roughness and delamination factor. As a dynamic approach, the multiple response optimisation was carried out using GRA and DFA for simultaneous evaluation. These two methods are best suited for multiple criteria evaluation and are also not much complicated. Findings: The process parameters were found optimum at a fibre orientation angle of 15°, helix angle of 25°, spindle speed of 6,000 rpm, and a feed rate of 0.04 mm/rev. Analysis of variance was employed to classify the significant parameters affecting the responses. The results indicate that the fibre orientation angle is the most significant parameter preceded by helix angle, feed rate, and spindle speed for GFRP composites.

abstract={Background: Proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines play a crucial role in the development and maintenance of immune mediated inflammatory diseases including rheumatic heart disease (RHD). Polymorphisms in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interferon (IFN)-γ, and interleukin (IL)-10 genes influence the differential cytokine expression as well as the pathogenesis of various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Objective: The aim of the study is to investigate the association between TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-10 gene polymorphisms and RHD in South Indian population. Materials and Methods: TNF-α (–308, –238), IFN-γ (+874), and IL-10 (–1082, –819, –592) gene polymorphisms were determined in 100 patients with RHD and 127 healthy siblings by PCR. Results: There was no significant difference in the genotype, allele, and haplotype frequencies of TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-10 polymorphisms between RHD patients and healthy siblings. Conclusion: The present study suggests that TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-10 gene variants may not be associated with the development of RHD in South Indian population. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the use of embedded Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) nitinol wire for the enhancement of vibration and damping characteristics of filament-wound fiber-reinforced plastic composite hollow shafts. Design/methodology/approach: The plain Glass Fiber-Reinforced Plastic (GFRP) and plain Carbon Fiber-Reinforced Plastic (CFRP) hollow shafts were manufactured by filament winding technique. Experimental modal analysis was conducted for plain hollow shafts of C1045 steel, GFRP and CFRP by subjecting them to flexural vibrations as per ASTM standard C747, with both ends clamped (C-C) end condition to investigate their vibration and damping behavior in terms of first natural frequency, damping time and damping ratio. Nitinol wires pre-stressed at various pre-strains (2, 4 and 6 per cent) were embedded with CFRP hollow shafts following same manufacturing technique, and similar experimental modal analysis was carried out by activating nitinol wires. The first natural frequencies of all the shaft materials were also predicted theoretically and compared with experimental measurements. Findings: Among the three materials C1045 steel, plain GFRP and plain CFRP, the vibration and damping behavior were found to be the best for plain CFRP. Hence, CFRP shafts were considered for further improvement by embedding nitinol wires at pre-stressed condition. For CFRP shafts embedded with nitinol wires, the damping time decreased; and damping ratio and first natural frequency increased with increase in percentage of pre-strain. In comparison with plain CFRP, 7 per cent increase in first natural frequency and 100 per cent increase in damping ratio were observed for nitinol embedded CFRP shafts with 6 per cent pre-strain. Theoretical predictions of the first natural frequencies agree well with the experimental results for all the shaft materials. Originality/value: The effect of nitinol on vibration and damping characteristics of filament wound hollow CFRP composite shafts with different pre-strains has not been studied extensively by the previous researchers. This paper addresses the effect of embedded nitinol wires pre-stressed at three varied pre-strains, that is, 2, 4 and 6 per cent on the vibration and damping characteristics of composite hollow CFRP shafts manufactured by filament winding technique. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Spinel MgFe2O4 thin films are prepared with the spray pyrolysis technique. The morphological study shows sand-like crystallites on the film with porosity. The structural study substantiates the polycrystalline nature of the synthesised MgFe2O4 films, which possess a spinel structure. The crystallite size is found to be 25–45 nm in size, which is noted from the morphological study. The energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX) reveals the existence of iron, oxygen and magnesium in MgFe2O4 film. The electrical resistance of MgFe2O4 decreases rapidly when the film is exposed towards acetone and ethanol vapours. The synthesised MgFe2O4 is highly sensitive to acetone vapour at 323 K. The selectivity, sensitivity, recovery time, stability and response time of MgFe2O4 film to acetone and ethanol sensing are described in this article. The findings show that MgFe2O4 films can be efficiently used for the detection of ethanol and acetone. © 2017, © 2017 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining Published by Taylor & Francis on behalf of the Institute.},

abstract={Introduction: Therapeutic gene editing is becoming a viable biomedical tool with the emergence of the CRISPR/Cas9 system. CRISPR-based technologies have promise as a therapeutic platform for many human genetic diseases previously considered untreatable, providing a flexible approach to high-fidelity gene editing. For many diseases, such as sickle-cell disease and beta thalassemia, curative therapy may already be on the horizon, with CRISPR-based clinical trials slated for the next few years. Translation of CRISPR-based therapy to in vivo application however, is no small feat, and major hurdles remain for efficacious use of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in clinical contexts. Areas covered: In this topical review, we highlight recent advances to in vivo delivery of the CRISPR/Cas9 system using various packaging formats, including viral, mRNA, plasmid, and protein-based approaches. We also discuss some of the barriers which have yet to be overcome for successful translation of this technology. Expert opinion: This review focuses on the challenges to efficacy for various delivery formats, with specific emphasis on overcoming these challenges through the development of carrier vehicles for transient approaches to CRISPR/Cas9 delivery in vivo. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Reinforcement in the form of strips, grids, and fibres enhances engineering properties of soil. In this study, an attempt has been made to use treated sisal fibres to reinforce the soil so that unconfined compressive strength can be enhanced. The compaction characteristics, stress-strain behavior, strength and failure patterns of the unreinforced, and reinforced sisal fibre reinforced soil were investigated. The inclusion of sisal fibres increases the strength and modifies compressibility and permeability of the soil. The results of the study show that the addition of sisal fibres to soil causes an increase in optimum moisture content and a decrease in dry density. The unconfined compressive strength and post-peak strength of the reinforced soil increase with fibre content of 2%. Failure pattern shows that fibre has a significant control over the development of cracks. Fibre inclusion suppresses the development of long cracks as they act as tension reinforcements. The use of sisal fibres gives the advantage of an eco-friendly material that aids sustainable development, in addition to the beneficial modification of soil properties. © 2018 Sharif University of Technology.

Concrete made with PC can be durable under mild exposure condition when properly designed, but it undergoes deterioration under severe exposure condition. Since very few works were performed on the ambient cured Alkali Activated Slag Concrete (AASC) under aggressive environmental condition, this work was intended to study the effect of binder content and sodium hydroxide concentration on AASC subjected to aggressive environment. In this regard, an experimental investigation was carried out to study the influence of chloride, acid, and sulphate environments on the physical and mechanical properties of AASC. The results show that the AASC mixes perform well under aggressive environment condition. © 2018 Sharif University of Technology. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Production of high-strength concrete by waste utilization attracts attention of more researchers everyday due to a number of benefits it brings to the present world. This paper, by replacing the cement in a considerable content, discusses the effect of such waste utilization on strength, durability, and structural behavior of high-strength concrete. Rice Husk Ash (RHA) (5 to 15%) and Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBFS) (20 to 40%) were used as mineral admixtures in three different percentages. The range of replacement of cement with this dual mixture was kept between 25% as minimum and 55% as maximum. Strength parameters, such as compression and flexure, and durability parameters, such as sorptivity, porosity, and freeze-thaw, were studied. All the tests were conducted as per ASTM standards. Ten combinations of ternary mix were tested and among them, the mix with 30% GGBFS and 5% RHA exhibited better performance in comparison with control concrete by compromising characteristic compressive strength to an extent of 5%. It also yielded better performance in terms of durability characteristics. Hence, it was concluded that it could be possible to produce high-strength concrete with 35% replacement of cement either with 20% GGBFS and 15% RHA or 30% GGBFS and 5% RHA. © 2018 Sharif University of Technology.

abstract={Fabricating nanofibrous scaffolds with robust blood compatibility remains an unmet challenge for cardiovascular applications since anti-thrombogenic surface coatings did not withstand physiological shear force. Hence, the present study envisages the influence of smooth and porous topographies of poly(lactic acid) (PLA) nanofibers on hemocompatibility as it could offer time-independent blood compatibility. Further, recent studies have evolved to integrate various contrasting agents for augmenting the prognostic properties of tissue engineered scaffolds; an attempt was also made to synthesize Curcumin–superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle complex (Cur–SPION) as a contrasting agent and impregnated into PLA nanofibers for evaluating the blood compatibility. Herein, electrospun nanofibers of PLA with different topographies (smooth and porous) were fabricated and characterized for surface morphology, zeta potential, fluorescence, and crystallinity. The scaffolds with smooth, porous and rough surface topographies were thoroughly investigated for its hemocompatibility by evaluating hemolysis percentage, platelet adhesion, in vitro kinetic clotting time, serum protein adsorption, plasma recalcification time (PRT), capture and release of erythrocytes. Although the nanofibers of all three groups showed acceptable hemolytic percentage (HP < 5%), the adhered RBCs on Cur–SPION based fibers undergo morphological transformation from biconcave discocytes to echinocytes with cube-like protrusions. On the contrary, no morphological changes were observed in RBCs cultured on smooth and porous nanofibers. Porous fibers exhibited excellent anti-thrombogenic property and adhered lesser platelets and maintained the discoidal morphology of native platelets. Cur–SPION integrated PLA nanofibers showed inactivated platelets with anti-thrombogenic activity compared to smooth nanofibers. In conclusion, PLA nanofibers porous topography did not affect the RBC membrane integrity and maintained discoidal morphology of platelets with superior anti-thrombogenic activity. However, smooth and Cur–SPION integrated PLA nanofibers were found to activate the platelets and deform the RBC membrane integrity, respectively. Hence, the nanofibers with porous structures provide an ideal topography for time-independent hemocompatibility.

abstract={Security plays a vital role and is the key challenge in Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANET). Infrastructure-less nature of MANET makes it arduous to envisage the genre of topology. Due to its inexhaustible access, information disseminated by roaming nodes to other nodes is susceptible to many hazardous attacks. Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS) is undoubtedly a defense structure to address threats in MANET. Many IDPS methods have been developed to ascertain the exceptional behavior in these networks. Key issue in such IDPS is lack of fast self-organized learning engine that facilitates comprehensive situation awareness for optimum decision making. Proposed “Intelligent Behavioral Hybridized Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IBH_IDPS)” is built with computational intelligence to detect complex multistage attacks making the system robust and reliable. The System comprises of an Intelligent Client Agent and a Smart Server empowered with fuzzy inference rule-based service engine to ensure confidentiality and integrity of network. Distributed Intelligent Client Agents incorporated with centralized Smart Server makes it capable of analyzing and categorizing unethical incidents appropriately through unsupervised learning mechanism. Experimental analysis proves the proposed model is highly attack resistant, reliable and secure on devices and shows promising gains with assured delivery ratio, low end-to-end delay compared to existing approach. © The Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers.},

abstract={MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules that are involved in post-transcriptional gene expression. In human CLL cancers and prostate cancer, the miRs that are residing in the same polycistronicRNA such as miR-15a and miR-16-1 are deleted. These miRs inhibit cell proliferation, tumorigenecity and induce apoptosis by targeting key genes such as BCL2, CCND1, MCL1 and WNT3A genes. Studies have found the genomic losses and as well as epigenetic modulations via HDAC inhibition and histone methylation regulate the miR-15/16 gene expression. HDAC inhibitors such as trichostatin A (TSA) and sodium butyrate caused an increase in the expression of miR-15a/16-1 via chromatin epigenetic modulation at Dleu2/miR-15a/16-1 promoter. MiR-15a/16-1-TP53 feedback circuitry, in which p53 directly transactivates miR-15a/16-1 promoter, while miR-15a/16-1 cluster targets TP53 expression regulate the cellular processes such as cell proliferation and apoptosis. These miRs have a huge potential in cancer therapeutics against different types of cancers such as hepatoma, ovarian cancer, and neuroblastoma. The present study demonstrates the role of these microRNAs on various cellular processes such as cell viability, cell-cycle, EMT, drug-resistance, cancer-stemness, angiogenesis, and apoptosis.

abstract={Image encryption is being employed as an important security provider to facilitate the communication of confidential images over various confidential networks. In this work, a RGB image encryption procedure based on Chaotic and Cellular Automata (CA) attractors is proposed. Lorenz, Lü and Rule 42 of CA have been used as encryption mediums in red, green and blue planes respectively. Besides scrambling and XORing operations on secret image, a random synthetic image has also been used for diffusion on the three planes. Cyclone II FPGA EP2C35F672C6 has been utilized to generate the low correlation yielding random synthetic image aided by beat frequency detection using PLLs and diffused bit generation process. The proposed approach satisfies the various statistical parameters and offers tangible resistance to differential, occlusion and chosen plain text attacks on RGB images. © 2018},

abstract={The capability of graphdiyne nanotube is valued as drug delivery system in the delivery of commercially known drugs namely, Imuran (Azathioprine), which aids in the cure of Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis, Pentasa (Mesalazine) used to treat Crohn's and other inflammatory diseases, Hyoscyamine (Daturine) is used to control few of the Parkinson's disease symptoms. In the present work, density functional theory calculations are carried out and explored the most deciding parameter namely, Bader charge transfer, adsorption energy, band gap and average energy gap variation upon adsorption of the drugs on graphdiyne. Furthermore, the chemical potential, chemical hardness and electrophilicity of graphdiyne nanotube are also reported. The parameters mentioned above give a clear perception on the adsorption of the drugs on to the graphdiyne nanotube, and the most protuberant adsorption sites of drugs on graphdiyne nanotube are studied. Besides, it is recognized that the drug Pentasa is known to be adsorbed more followed by the drug Hyoscyamine and Imuran. The outcome of the proposed work suggested that the graphdiyne nanotube can be effectively utilized as a drug delivery system for the chronic disease drugs. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Abstract: The computational study of flavylium compound consists of anthocyanin pigments: callistephin, Chrysanthemin, oenin and mytrillin, and anthocyanidin pigments: peonidin and petunidin dyes are used to identify the potential photosensitizer for dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC). Density functional theory is adopted to study methoxyl and hydroxyl groups in six pigments. The computed results of six dyes show good oscillator strength (f), light harvesting efficiency, electron injection (Δ Ginject) and electron regeneration (Δ Gregen). The short-circuit current density (Jsc) , total reorganization energy (λ total) and open-circuit voltage (Voc) were also discussed. Intermolecular charge transfer of six dyes was examined using frontier molecular orbital. However, Peonidin/Titanium dioxide system has shown a significant response in density of states. Hence, this study confirms peonidin dye can be used as a photosensitizer for DSSC applications.

abstract={Cloud service selection, a promising research directive provides an intelligent solution via. service ranking based on the Quality of Service (QoS) attributes for the identification of trustworthy Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) among a wide range of functionally-equivalent CSPs. Further, the impact of objective and subjective assessment data on the accuracy of the service selection model makes the credibility of the assessment data, a major concern for the researchers in service-oriented environments. To address the challenges with respect to the identification of the user requirement compliant CSPs, data credibility, service ranking, etc. we present Hypergraph –Binary Fruit Fly Optimization based service ranking Algorithm (HBFFOA), a trust-centric approach for the identification of suitable and trustworthy cloud service providers. HBFFOA employs hypergraph partitioning, time-varying mapping function, helly property, and binary fruit fly optimization algorithm for the identification of similar service providers, credibility based trust assessment, selection of trustworthy service providers, and optimal service ranking respectively. Experiments using synthetic QoS dataset from WSDream#2 illustrates the effectiveness, practicability, scalability and computational attractiveness of HBFFOA over the existing service selection approaches in terms of precision, stability, statistical test, and time complexity analysis. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Abstract: The adsorption behavior of ethanol vapor molecules on MnFe2O4 (MFO) nanostructures was carried out using first-principles calculation. The structural stability including electronic properties of MFO spinel structure is explored using ab-initio method. From the phonon energy band structure, it is observed that there are no imaginary frequencies, which confirms the geometric stability of MFO. The global minima interaction sites of ethanol on MFO nanostructure are studied. The adsorption of ethanol molecule is exothermic, and the adsorption energy is calculated to be − 0.448 to − 0.882 eV per molecule. The density of states spectrum and band structure of MFO nanostructure get modified when the sensing material is exposed to the ethanol molecule atmosphere. Moreover, the interaction behavior of ethanol vapor molecules on MFO molecular structure is investigated with reference to the adsorption energy, Bader charge analysis, percentage of average energy gap variation. The desorption of ethanol vapor from MFO material have been studied and low recovery time in the order of 0.025 s is noticed. In addition, the most suitable adsorption sites of ethanol vapor molecules on spinel MnFe2O4 is identified and reported. The findings suggest the application of MFO material for the sensing of ethanol molecules.

abstract={In multimedia communication, significance of the images for data representation is noteworthy. In this context, secure transmission of images over open channel has become a challenging task. Creation of different strategies in improving the secure image transmission always has a demand. The proposed work suggests an RGB image encryption with the confluence of attractors and hardware triggered key image in which confusion and diffusion were accomplished by Lorenz, Lü and Cellular Automata attractors. The uniqueness of proposed encryption scheme is a key image generation module through cascaded Ring Oscillator circuit which creates M × N key image for diffusion of pixels. Facilitating the authenticated networked access to key image generation hardware enables the secure server-client architecture for a variety of secure image transfer applications. The proposed approach is a hardware – software codesign which possesses a good keyspace, improved key sensitivity and satisfies the various statistical parameters thus offering substantial resistance to differential, occlusion and chosen plaintext attacks on RGB images. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={One of the strategies employed to improve the capacitance of reduced graphene oxide is nitrogen doping. Herein, we report the effectiveness of hydrazine hydrate as a nitrogen dopant cum reducing agent. Graphene oxide synthesized by modified Hummer's method is reduced hydrothermally in the presence and in the absence of hydrazine hydrate and are labeled as NRGO-H and RGO-H, respectively. Hydrothermal reduction of graphene oxide in the presence of a small amount of (6 µL) hydrazine hydrate results in doping of 1.66 atomic weight % of nitrogen as inferred from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic studies. The effect of nitrogen doping on the morphology and textural properties of reduced graphene oxide is systematically studied using Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscope and nitrogen sorption studies. The protruding dopant prevents restacking of graphene layers, resulting in comparatively less number of graphene layers in NRGO-H than in RGO-H. Nitrogen doping also increases number of mesopores and thereby surface area. Owing to Faradaic reaction of the dopant, NRGO-H delivers higher specific capacitance (332 F g −1 ) than RGO-H (149 F g −1 ) in aqueous electrolyte (0.25 M H 2 SO 4 ). © 2018},

abstract={Affective computing is gaining paramount importance in ensuring the better and effective human–machine interaction. As glottal and speech signals depict the characteristics of the emotional nature of the speaker in addition to the linguistic information, speaker’s emotions are needed to be recognised to give meaningful response by the system. This paper emphasises the effectiveness and efficiency in selecting the energy features by passing the speech through the Gamma tone filters spaced in Equivalent rectangular bandwidth (ERB), MEL and BARK scale. Various modelling techniques are used to develop the robust multi-speaker independent speaker’s emotion/stress recognition system. Since EMO-DB Berlin database and SAVEE emotional audio-visual database used in this work contain the only limited set of speech utterances uttered by 10/4 actors/speakers in different emotions, it has become challenging to improve the performance of the stress/emotion recognition system. Speaker independent emotion recognition is done by extracting the Gamma tone energy features and cepstral features by passing the concatenated speech considered for training through the Gamma tone filters spaced in ERB, MEL and BARK scales. Subsequently, VQ/Fuzzy clustering models and continuous density hidden Markov models are created for all emotions and evaluation is done with the utterances of a speaker independent of speeches considered for training. The proposed features for test utterances are captured and applied to the VQ/Fuzzy/MHMM/SVM models and testing is performed by using minimum distance criterion/maximum log-likelihood criterion. The proposed Gamma tone energy/cepstral features and modelling techniques provide complementary evidence in assessing the performance of the system. This algorithm offers 96%, 79%, and 95.3% as weighted accuracy recall for the stress recognition system with respect to the classification done on emotion-specific group VQ/Fuzzy/MHMM/SVM models for GTF energy features with Gamma tone filters spaced in ERB, MEL and BARK scale respectively for the system evaluated for the EMO-DB database. Weighted accuracy recall is found to be 91%, 93% and 94% for the classification done on emotion-specific group models for GTF energy features with Gamma tone filters spaced in ERB, MEL and BARK scale respectively for the evaluation done on the utterances chosen from the SAVEE database. Gamma tone Cepstral features provide the overall accuracy of 92%, 90% and 92% for filters spaced in ERB, MEL and BARK scale for Berlin EMO-DB. Decision level fusion classification based on GTF energy features and modelling techniques provides the overall accuracy as 99.8% for EO-DB database and 100% for SAVEE database. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Acerola (Malpighia emarginata DC.) is one of the richest natural sources of ascorbic acid and contains a plethora of phytonutrients like carotenoids phenolics, anthocyanins, and flavonoids. There is an upsurge of interest in this fruit among the scientific community and pharmaceutical companies over the last few years. The fruit contains an exorbitant amount of ascorbic acid in the range of 1500–4500 mg/100 g, which is around 50–100 times than that of orange or lemon. Having a reservoir of phytonutrients, the fruit exhibits high antioxidant capacity and several interesting biofunctional properties like skin whitening effect, anti-aging and multidrug resistant reversal activity. Countries like Brazil, realizing the potential of the fruit have started to exploit it commercially and have established a structured agro-industrial based market. In spite of possessing an enriched nutrient profile with potent “functional food” appeal, acerola is underutilized in large part of the globe and demands greater attention. A comprehensive literature analysis was carried out with reference to the latest frontiers on the compositional characteristics of the fruit. Emphasis has been given on newer dimensions of functional aspects of ascorbic acid and allied work and pectin and pectin methylesterase. The range of nutraceutical phytonutrients present in acerola and their biofunctional properties has been discussed. Recent advances in the value addition of the fruit highlighting the use of techniques like filtration, encapsulation, ultrasound, sonication, etc. are also elaborated. Furthermore, the potential use of acerola pulp in edible films and waste utilization for development of valuable byproducts has been highlighted. © 2018, Association of Food Scientists & Technologists (India).},

abstract={Due to the convenience and nutritional value, minimally processed fruits and vegetables (MPFV) are one of the rapid growing sectors in the food industry. However, their microbiological safety is a cause of great concern. Essential oils (EOs), known for potent antimicrobial efficacy have been shown to reduce microbial load in MPFV, but their low water solubility, high volatility and strong organoleptic properties limit their wide use. Encapsulating EOs to nanoemulsion offers a viable remedy for such limitations. Due to the unique properties of the EOs nanoemulsion, there has been an increasing interest in their fabrication and use in food system. The present review article encompasses the overview of the prominent microflora present in MPFV, the recent developments on the fabrication and stability of EOs based nanoemulsion, their in vitro antimicrobial activity and their application in MPFV. This review also discusses the EOs based nanoemulsions antimicrobial mechanism of action and their regulatory issues related to their use. Application of EOs based nanoemulsion either as washing disinfectant or with incorporation into edible coatings have been shown to considerably improve the microbial quality and safety of MPFV. This efficacy has been further shown to increase when combined with other hurdles. However, further studies are required on the toxicity of EOs based nanoemulsion to assure its commercial exploitation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) are the most common cause of UTI, accounting for more than 90% infections in the normal and unobstructed urinary tracts. Multi-drug resistance (MDR) is an emerging threat to the mankind and hence, there is an urge to develop alternative therapies. Targeting quorum sensing (QS), a cell-cell communication process regulates various biofilm and virulence factors would be a most promising alternate which curbs the pathogenesis without killing the bacteria, unlike antibiotics. SdiA, a quorum regulator is well-known to control the behavioural changes of UPEC in establishing biofilm and virulence. Therefore, we have hypothesized that the SdiA-selective inhibitors derived from the plant, Melia dubia using the molecular docking would be a remarkable therapeutic candidate to down regulate the UPEC biofilm and virulence phenotypes. In this study, we have designed, synthesized and characterized the fructose-furoic acid ester by NMR and ESI-MS. In vitro studies revealed that the QSI-MD selectively inhibits UPEC adherence and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) analysis showed the effectiveness of QSI-MD to inhibit the UPEC biofilm. Genetic studies using qRT-PCR revealed the down-regulation of quorum sensing regulated genes (fimA, csgA, espA). Based on the findings, we could propose that the QSI-MD could possibly act through SdiA and show target-specific inhibition of biofilm and virulence. It is notable that more than 70 bacterial species execute their communication through the SdiA homologues (LuxIR system). Hence, the QSI-MD could be further developed as a broad-spectrum anti-infective drug. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Nanosensors have been widely used for detecting toxic and volatile gases present in indoor and outdoor environment due to their swift response and recovery characteristics. They exhibit high selectivity, sensitivity, quick response and recovery signatures towards target gases. However, determination of the response and recovery time from the transient response of the chemiresistive sensor needs to be accurate to exactly represent the figure of merits of nanosensors. In this context, a non-linear model has been employed to analyse the transient response and recovery curves of a chemiresistive ammonia sensor using nanostructured cobalt-doped-ZnO thin film. Modified Hill equations have been developed based on sigmoidal behaviour of the transient curves. Based on the error analysis, only the response t 95% and recovery t 95% model showed best results in validation with a low relative prediction error of 0.003 and 0.001 and low root mean square error for cross validation of 9.5 and 4.68 respectively. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a predominant aquaculture pathogen causing food borne infections through the consumption of raw or undercooked sea foods. Biofilm formation and quorum sensing mediated virulence factors play a pivotal role in mediating these infections. The present study evaluates the antibiofilm and anti-quorum sensing potential of an unexplored essential oil (EO) and its major compounds (cinnamaldehyde and linalool) against V. parahaemolyticus. Furthermore, the synergistic effects of the EO along with a commercial available DNase I and marine bacterial DNase (MBD) were explored for its antibiofilm efficacy. In addition, the food preservative efficacy of linalool and cinnamaldehyde were evaluated in prawns (a sea-food model) infected with V. parahaemolyticus stored at 28 °C and 4 °C. The treated prawns showed reduced bacterial load and exhibited minimum lipid peroxidation. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) revealed the intact muscle tissues of the treated samples which indicate that the EO components did not damage the prawn tissues. The results revealed that the individual EO components has good efficacy equal to that of the standard food preservative sodium benzoate. This study shows that the synergistic action of EO and DNases might offer an alternate strategy for sea food preservation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Personalized information recommendation based on social tagging is a hot issue in academia nowadays, butthe concept of an authoritative user has not been emphasized in the existing literature. This paper first proposes a method to determine user authority in a social tagging system, in which the quality authority and quantity authority of users are calculated from a user co-occurrence network, which is derived from users’ participation in the social tagging system. Degree centrality is employed for the user authority calculations, which are taken as weights for tag voting. On this basis, a resource model is constructed by summing up the tags from each user and their corresponding weights to represent each resource in the collection. User models are then obtained based on the resource models, and cosine similarity is used for making resource recommendations to users. An experiment was conducted on a dataset crawled from Delicious.com. The results show that the average GP relevance of the authoritative user based algorithm reaches 0.6115 much better than two benchmark algorithms. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In the current study we have evaluated the antibiofilm and antivirulent properties of unexplored essential oils (EOs) obtained from Pogostemon heyneanus and Cinnamomum tamala against Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains. The EOs from both the aromatic plants was screened for their ability to prevent biofilm formation and to disrupt preformed biofilms. The efficacy of both the EOs to disrupt the preformed biofilms of various MRSA strains was determined by Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM).The EOs were further able to reduce the Extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) and slime synthesis the two factors of the biofilm assemblage. The EOs was also found to be effective in reducing virulence factors like staphyloxanthin and hemolysin. In silico docking studies were performed for the major components of essential oils and dehydroxysqualene synthase of MRSA which is responsible for the synthesis of staphyloxanthin. The results suggest that (E)-nerolidol showed better binding affinity towards the enzyme. Other compounds have similar binding strengths with the enzyme. Furthermore, the synergistic effect EOs along with the commercially available DNaseI and Marine Bacterial DNase (MBD) showed that the synergistic effect had enhanced biofilm disruption ability. The results show that EOs from P. heyneanus and C. tamala has potential antivirulent and biofilm inhibitory properties against clinical and drug resistant S. aureus strains. The present study highlights the importance of bioprospecting plant based natural products as an alternative for antibiotics owing to the emergence of multi-drug resistant strains. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={During the last few decades, gold nanoparticles (AuNP's) have gained considerable attention in nanomedicine and expanded its application in clinical diagnosis and as therapeutics. Employing plant extract for synthesising gold nanoparticles proves to be an eco-friendly technology for large scale production. It is highly economical and suitable for biological applications by negating the use of chemicals involved in conventional route. In this study, AuNP's was prepared by a simple one step method of employing aqueous Mangifera indica seed extract as a reducing agent. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy revealed spherical shaped nanoparticles and dynamic light scattering analysis indicated the AuNP's to be approximately 46.8 nm in size. AuNP's efficiently inhibited the growth of E. coli and S. aureus by its inherent ability to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and exhibited detrimental effects towards the tested bacterial species. Biocompatibility assessment indicated the non-toxic nature of AuNP's towards mesenchymal stem cells at 25 μg/ml and interestingly, suppressed the growth of human gastric cancer cells under in vitro culture conditions. AuNP's significantly exhibited anti-angiogenic property in chick chorioallantoic membrane model (CAM) by downregulating Ang-1/Tie2 pathway. Overall, the synthesized AuNP's exhibited antibacterial and anti-angiogenic properties with high biocompatibility thereby supporting its candidature for various biomedical applications. It can be employed in suppressing tumor growth, combat inflammatory diseases that necessitate the involvement of angiogenesis suppression, and antibacterial activity is suitable for its clinical translation to negate surgery associated infections. © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS},

The surface of carbon cellulosic fabric was modified by sol-gel and sputter seed layer-coated sol-gel techniques. ZnO grown fabrics were characterized using X-ray Diffractometer (XRD), Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM), Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), X-ray Photoelectron Spectrometer (XPS) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR). Subsequently, UV-blocking and gas sensing properties of the modified textile samples were investigated. The seed layer initiated sol-gel modified cotton fabric showed a maximum UV protection factor (UPF) of 378.

abstract={Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) a pleiotropic cytokine induces pro-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic changes in conditions such as diabetic retinopathy (DR) and neovascular age related macular degeneration (NV-AMD). Hence, inhibition of TNFα mediated changes can benefit the management of DR and NV-AMD. Triphala, an ayurvedic herbal preparation is known to have immunomodulatry functions. In this study we evaluated the alcoholic extract of triphala (AlE) and its compounds Chebulagic acid (CA), Chebulinic acid (CI) and Gallic acid (GA) for their anti-TNFα activity. TNFα induced pro-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic changes in the retinal-choroid microvascular endothelial cells (RF/6A). Treatment with CA/CI/GA and the whole Triphala extract showed characteristic inhibition of MMP-9, cell proliferation/migration and tube formation as well the expression of IL-6, IL-8 and MCP-1 without affecting cell viability. This was mediated by inhibition of p38, ERK and NFκB phosphorylation. Ex vivo angiogenesis assay using chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model also showed that TNFα-induced angiogenesis and it was inhibited by AlE and its active principles. Further, in silico studies revealed that CA, CI and GA are capable of binding the TNFα-receptor-1 to mediate anti-TNFα activity. This study explains the immunomodulatory function of Triphala, evaluated in the context of retinal and choroid vasculopathies in vitro and ex vivo; which showed that CA, CI and GA can be a potential pharmacological agents in the management of DR and NV-AMD. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Head and trunk muscles have discrete embryological origins and are governed by distinct regulatory programmes. Whereas the developmental route of trunk muscles from mesoderm is well studied, that of head muscles is ill defined. Here, we show that, unlike the myogenic trunk paraxial mesoderm, head mesoderm development is independent of the T/Tbx6 network in mouse. We reveal that, in contrast to Wnt and FGF-driven trunk mesoderm, dual inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin and Nodal specifies head mesoderm. Remarkably, the progenitors derived from embryonic stem cells by dual inhibition efficiently differentiate into cardiac and skeletal muscle cells. This twin potential is the defining feature of cardiopharyngeal mesoderm: the head subtype giving rise to heart and branchiomeric head muscles. Therefore, our findings provide compelling evidence that dual inhibition specifies head mesoderm and unravel the mechanism that diversifies head and trunk muscle programmes during early mesoderm fate commitment. Significantly, this is the first report of directed differentiation of pluripotent stem cells, without transgenes, into progenitors with muscle/heart dual potential. Ability to generate branchiomeric muscle in vitro could catalyse efforts in modelling myopathies that selectively involve head muscles. © 2018. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd |.},

abstract={Purpose: Retinoblastoma (RB) is a pediatric ocular cancer which is caused due to the aberrations in the RB1 gene. The changes in the membrane proteomics would help in understanding the development of the retinoblastoma and could identify candidates for biomarkers and therapy. Experimental design: Quantitative proteomics is performed on the enriched membrane fractions from pooled normal retina (n = 5) and pooled retinoblastoma tissues (n = 5). The proteins are tryptic-digested and tagged with iTRAQ labels. Orbitrap mass spectrometry is used to analyze and quantify the deregulated membrane proteins involved in the RB tumor progression. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is used to further validate few of the differentially expressed proteins. Results: A total of 3122 proteins are identified of which, 663 proteins are found to be deregulated with ≥two fold change in the RB tumor compared to the retina. 282 proteins are upregulated and 381 are downregulated with ≥2 peptide identifications. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that, most of the proteins are involved in the transport, cellular communication, and growth. Overexpression of lamin B1 (LMNB1) and transferrin receptor (TFRC) are observed in RB tumors using IHC. Conclusion and clinical relevance: The present study, is the first comprehensive quantitative membrane proteomic atlas of the differentially regulated proteins in RB compared to the retina. LMNB1 and TFRC could be potential biomarkers for this childhood cancer. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim},

abstract={Cancer continues to be ranked among the top causes of mortality in the world despite the advances made in science and technology. The sub-par performance of cancer therapeutic strategies is due to the transformation of the cancer from a proliferating mass of cells into an impregnable fortress that manipulates and controls the microenvironment to prevent access to any potential cytotoxic factor as well as circumvent the innate immune surveillance processes. Recruitment of the native immune cells to selectively recognize and kill cancer cells can serve to augment the cytotoxic effects of conventional cancer therapeutic approaches. In addition to annihilation of the cancer cells, the induction of memory in the immune cells prevents the possibility of cancer recurrence. However, despite the apparent benefits of cancer immunotherapy, there are several pitfalls that need to be addressed in order to extend these benefits to the clinic. In this context, engineered nanostructured carrier systems can be effectively employed for an activation and priming of the host immune system selectively against the target cancer cells. This has led to the emergence of "nanoimmunotherapy" as an important therapeutic approach against cancer. The use of multi-functional nanomaterials in combination with immunotherapy offers possible solutions to overcome the current limitations in cancer therapy and represents the next generation of "smart therapeutics," which forms the prime focus of discussion in this review. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.},

abstract={The focal and non-focal epilepsy is seen to be a chronic neurological brain disorder, which has affected ≈ ~60 million people in the world. Hence, an early detection of the focal epileptic seizures can be carried out using the EEG signals, which act as a helpful tool for early diagnosis of epilepsy. Several EEG-based approaches have been proposed and developed to understand the underlying characteristics of the epileptic seizures. Despite the fact that the early results were positive, the proposed techniques cannot generate reproducible results and lack a statistical validation, which has led to doubts regarding the presence of the pre-ictal state. Various methodical and algorithmic studies have indicated that the transition to an ictal state is not a random process, and the build-up can lead to epileptic seizures. This study reviews many recently-proposed algorithms for detecting the focal epileptic seizures. Generally, the techniques developed for detecting the epileptic seizures were based on tensors, entropy, empirical mode decomposition, wavelet transform and dynamic analysis. The existing algorithms were compared and the need for implementing a practical and reliable new algorithm is highlighted. The research regarding the epileptic seizure detection research is more focused on the development of precise and non-invasive techniques for rapid and reliable diagnosis. Finally, the researchers noted that all the methods that were developed for epileptic seizure detection lacks standardization, which hinders the homogeneous comparison of the detector performance. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={India is an agricultural country with an abundance of fertile lands. It is thereby highly crucial, that as engineers it is necessary to contribute to the growth of this primary sector. Agricultural sectors have failed to realise that technology can, not only be utilised for modernisation but also for restoring our heritage. Agriculture is the heart of our vibrant culture, and this should, without doubt, flourish in our nation. There is an exponential rise in population which induces a need to use our resources judiciously. As the demand for food grains increases so does the demand for water. This thought was the foundation for our project and the objective of this paper, is to automate the irrigation system. The proposed methodology uses Arduino for moisture sensing and controlling water supply and Node Microcontroller Unit (MCU) for notifying the status of the designed irrigation system to the farmers through mobile communication. The idea of Internet of Things (IOT) has been integrated with automation to design the proposed 'Automatic Irrigation System'. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={With the improvement in technology and with the increase in the use of wireless devices there is deficiency of radio spectrum. Cognitive radio is considered as the solution for this problem. Cognitive radio is capable to detect which communication channels are in use and which are free, and immediately move into free channels while avoiding the used ones. This increases the usage of radio frequency spectrum. Any wireless system is prone to attack. Likewise, the main two attacks in the physical layer of cognitive radio are Primary User Emulation Attack (PUEA) and replay attack. This paper focusses on mitigating these two attacks with the aid of authentication tag and distance calculation. Mitigation of these attacks results in error free transmission which in turn fallouts in efficient dynamic spectrum access. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Digital data is a fundamental source of multimedia platform where image communication is a substantial part of it. Through image communication, information is transmitted and received on network in various fields like armed forces, military, healthcare, entertainment, and many more. To protect information, security architectures are necessary. This work proposes an enhanced method of gray scale image encryption where chaotic selection of encryption algorithm takes the priority. Confusion and diffusion is performed with four pseudo random sequence generators namely Chaotic logistic map, chaotic tent map, Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) and combined chaotic map. Confusion phase is a constant operation in which logistic map generated random sequences are used to scramble the image. In diffusion phase, chaotic selection of random sequence generator is accomplished by a sum of four digits random number generated using logistic map. Then diffusion is performed by XORing the scrambled image with generated random sequences produced from respective generator. This image encryption scheme is designed using python 2.7 and validated by performing entropy, correlation, histogram, differential, encryption quality and NIST test analyses. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={With the tremendous growth and increased use of wireless technology for communication, corruption of data due to channel noise and hacking of data by the intruders become inevitable. One of the vital attacks in the physical layer of the cognitive radio is Primary User Emulation Attack (PUEA). Cognitive radio has risen as a solution for spectrum shortage issue raised due to the excessive usage of wireless devices. This manuscript focusses on mitigating the PUEA with the aid of some special sequences known as authentication tag. The tag is generated in two ways- gold codes are treated as authentication tag and Pseudo Noise (PN) are considered as tag. The tags are embedded with the signal and transmitted to the cognitive radio. Mitigating the PUEA eliminates the wastage of bandwidth and results in effective dynamic spectrum access. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Looking at the demands of secure communication schemes, new platforms for information security have a significant role in the data protection. In this paper, image encryption on reconfigurable hardware FPGA has been proposed with the confluence of the chaotic map and DNA schemes. Confusion and diffusion were performed with both Chaotic and DNA approaches. The image encryption architecture with 128 × 128 grayscale image which was implemented on Cyclone II FPGA EP2C35F672C6 consumed 23,877 (72%) logic elements, 131,072 (27%) internal M4KRAM memory units with a total thermal power dissipation of 273.55 mW for a test image. NPCR, UACI, Correlation, Uniform distribution and entropy analyses revealed the strength of the proposed scheme which requires a specific bitstream and hardware to retrieve and decrypt the hidden secret image on FPGA. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={True random number generators (TRNG) have an appreciable demand in key generation of crypto processors. FPGA based TRNGs offer various advantages for generation, packing and storage. Metastability, jitter, race around and memory collision are some of the entropy sources for extraction of true randomness. In this work, jitter extraction is the prime focus for randomness harvesting. Two different frequencies have been generated by Onchip PLL of FPGA which were used in an asynchronous manner for random bit generation. Two Flip-flops have been used in this design after which post processing unit enhances the randomness. Both Von - Neumann Corrector as well as 1D logistic map have been experimented as post processing functions. Randomness of the numbers was tested and ensured by performing entropy analysis as well as NIST tests. This proposed TRNG has been designed using VHDL and implemented on Altera Cyclone II EP2C35F672C6N FPGA consuming 1298 logic elements with a throughput of 26.84 Mbps. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Image has become an indispensible part of data communication through embedded devices. LightWeight Stream Encryption (LWSE) algorithm for images had been already proposed and evaluated with Matlab code on a desktop system. This paper evaluates the real-time lightweight property of an existing LWSE algorithm in terms of its memory footprint and execution time on a resource constrained low power embedded device containing ARM7 core. A modification on LWSE algorithm is also proposed through the insertion of a shuffling process on plain image prior to the encryption. Various analysis and tests have been performed to validate the results of original and modified LWSE algorithm in the aspect of security. The study on lightweight parameters such as code size, and execution time of the embedded hardware while running the original and modified versions of LWSE algorithm shows its aptness for realtime applications. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Security plays a vital role in the world of communication. In applications such as banking, making access to any personal resource of an individual via wireless media requires the validation of authorized user at every moment. Static passwords have been in use which is vulnerable to attacks such as reply attack. One Time Password (OTP) is a particular kind of password that is valid only for only one login session or transaction. OTP provides a secure way for user authentication as it becomes invalid when used beyond the prescribed time frame. High level of randomness is the significant property required for OTPs. True randomness can be generated from real-world parameters that can produce unpredictable variations in its output. This paper presents an embedded hardware OTP generation system based on remote request via DTMF signals. The proposed hardware uses a confluence of real-world parameters and software-based chaotic function on an embedded platform for OTP generation. The proposed system also facilitates change in the generation of OTPs via discretionary external inputs from users. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={The intension is to provide the contrast between Clustering Algorithm and Gaussian Mixture Model using Perceptual Linear Prediction features to assess the singer identification structure using two phases, phase 1 as training and phase 2 as testing over the film tracks(vocal with background music). The intent of assessing of singer is to categorize different singers impartial of data that is trained in phase 1. The aspects for two phases are executed for downright tracks from films for 20 different singers. In phase 1 aspects, for individual singer 15 tracks are loaded as input data. Now loaded datas are shaped to go through a deck of pre-handling steps. The pre-handling steps includes three more internal stages with stage1 as Pre-emphasis, stage2 as Frame Blocking and stage3 as Windowing. From individual context of pre-handled signal PLP features are evolved. Using the K-Means Clustering Algorithm and GMM the phase1 output is developed for individual singers. In Clustering algorithm the singer is categorized deployed with choice of the model that gives mean value as minimum. In GMM, by using Maximum Likelihood (ML) algorithm singers are categorized deployed with choice of the model that gives maximum likelihood. Depending on identity of accuracy the singer identification structure is performed. (Abstract) © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={In this era of silicon age, the internet services have become an indispensable part of human life. People moving fast towards the digitized world and sending an information have never been much easier from the onset of file transfer applications, cloud-based applications, messengers and email services. Big companies and startups prefer cloud-based software solutions due to its accessibility, security and easy sharing features. Unfortunately, 'Where there are rivers, there are potholes'. Crackers and unethical hackers exist in the environment, who make this digitization a 'nightmare' for newcomers and existing users. Millions of security breaches have occurred in decades in which few of them are highly severe. The hackers stole highly sensitive information such as personal and official. And this incident left with millions of information at risk of spamming, phishing attacks and etc. The proposed approach focuses the transferring file securely (TranSecure) from the authenticated user. Therefore there requires features for encrypting the data such that even if it is stolen it will be indecipherable. Thus the user's privacy is still satisfied. This demand brings out the idea of the approach which securely transmits data between users along with first in class encryption and compression for security and storage space conservation respectively. © 2018 IEEE.},

Moreover, the adsorption of various breath biomarkers namely, 2,3,4-trimethyl hexane, 4-methyl octane, ethyl benzene and undecane molecules on HvSi material is explored with essential parameters namely Bader charge transfer, energy gap, adsorption energy and average energy gap variation. Moreover, the interaction of biomarkers with HvSi base material changes the adsorption energy of the base material, which is noticed to be in the range of −0.778 to −1.274 eV.

abstract={Acid and base mediated sol–gel process followed by supercritical extraction of ethanol used for the synthesis of lithium-ion doped nickel ferrite loaded silica composite aerogels using a high-temperature high-pressure autoclave. The physical-chemical properties of synthesized materials are characterized using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and DC-conductivity measurements. The conductivity results suggest that maximum electrical conductivity of 8.63 × 10 −9 Scm −1 is obtained for 4% Li 2 O doped 96%{10% NiFe 2 O 4 + 90% SiO 2 } composite aerogel due to Li + migration between grain-grain interface and electron hopping between Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ . Further, the XRD result also confirms the formation of amorphous SiO 2 , Li 2 O with crystalline NiFe 2 O 4 composite aerogel. FTIR results confirm the bond formation through molecular vibration between Si-O-Si and Ni 2+ /Fe 3+ -O.

Here, the frequency shift of generated photons, as a response to change in the analyte RI, is analyzed using an appropriately modified nonlinear Schrödinger equation.

Au/ZnO NWs shows comparatively lesser response time (ZnO = 66 s and Au/ZnO = 8 s) and recovery time (ZnO = 38 s and Au/ZnO = 36 s) than that of bare ZnO NWs. The catalytic activity of the Au nanoparticles significantly reduces the response time during the detection of ammonia vapour.

abstract={We consider the nonlinear Helmholtz (NLH) equation describing the beam propagation in a planar waveguide with Kerr-like nonlinearity under non-paraxial approximation. By applying the Lie symmetry analysis, we determine the Lie point symmetries and the corresponding symmetry reductions in the form of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with the help of the optimal systems of one-dimensional subalgebras. Our investigation reveals an important fact that in spite of the original NLH equation being non-integrable, its symmetry reductions are of Painlevé integrable. We study the resulting sets of nonlinear ODEs analytically either by constructing the integrals of motion using the modified Prelle–Singer method or by obtaining explicit travelling wave-like solutions including solitary and symbiotic solitary wave solutions. Also, we carry out a detailed numerical analysis of the reduced equations and obtain multi-peak nonlinear wave trains. As a special case of the NLH equation, we also make a comparison between the symmetries of the present NLH system and that of the standard nonlinear Schrödinger equation for which symmetries are long available in the literature. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Transition metal oxides based high efficiency silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells have emerged as promising candidate due to their low manufacturing cost and avoidance of poisonous dopant gases. Temperature dependent J V curves in such solar cells could reveal the physical insight about the carrier collection mechanism. In this work, the temperature dependence of Molybdenum Oxide (MoOx) based SHJ is modelled and compared with the experimental J-V curves (under both dark and 1-sun illumination). This study validates the hole collection mechanism using MoOx and explains the disappearance of the kink in J-V curves at higher temperatures. In addition, we have extracted the temperature coefficient for MoOx-SHJ solar cells and found that they are almost identical to that of standard SHJ cells which supports MoOx-SHJ cells as a promising candidate for future low cost high efficiency solar cells. © 2018 Author(s).},

abstract={Green synthesis of metal nanoparticles (NPs) has now received the attention of researchers due to ease of preparation and its potential to overcome hazards of these chemicals for an eco-friendly milieu. In this study, copper oxide (CuO) NPs were synthesised via Desmodium gangeticum aqueous root extract and standard chemical method, further characterised by UV-visible spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, Thermogravimetric analysis and scanning electron microscopy. The nephrotoxicity of the NP obtained from two routes were compared and evaluated at subcellular level in Wistar rat, renal proximal epithelial cells (LLC PK1 cell lines) and isolated renal mitochondria. CuO NP synthesised by chemical route showed prominent nephrotoxicity measured via adverse cytotoxicity to LLC PK1 cells, elevated renal oxidative stress and damage to renal tissue (determined by impaired alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, urea, uric acid and creatinine in the blood). However, at the level of cell organelle, CuO NP from both routes are non-toxic to mitochondrial functional activity. The authors' finding suggests that CuO NP synthesised by chemical route may induce nephrotoxicity, but may be overcome by co-administration of antioxidants, as it is not mito-toxic.},

In this work, a hybrid aluminium matrix composite with AA7475 aluminium alloy as matrix material was fabricated using stir casting technique, by adding 5 wt.% volume fraction of reinforcement particles such as Boron carbide (B4C) and Cerium oxide (CeO2). To study the effect of B4C and CeO2 particles, composites were created with individual reinforcements also, for 5 wt.% volume fraction. Friction Stir Welding (FSW) was conducted on the composite plate specimens to study the mechanical behavior of the welded joint. Mechanical tests were performed before and after friction stir welding of the above aluminium composites and compared. The results revealed a remarkable improvement of mechanical properties after addition of B4C particles and increased ductility on all the samples. © 2018 IAEME Publication.},

The influence due to the substitution of group-III elements on Ge-NC is studied using the density of states (DOS) spectrum and electron density. As a matter of fact, from the molecular electrostatic potential surface, it is noticed that the impurity substitution at the apex of Ge-NC leads to increase in the field emission properties due to delocalization of electron by the charge transfer at the apex of nanocone. In addition, the Mulliken charge transfer, work function and current density of the emitted electron were calculated for the pristine and Ga and Al-doped Ge-NC. The results suggest that the substitution of group-III impurity along the apex of Ge-NC leads to the improved field emission, which can be used for the assembly of vacuum electronics and nanoelectronics. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The Three-dimensional structure of a protein depends on the interaction between their amino acid residues. These interactions are in turn influenced by various biophysical properties of the amino acids. There are several examples of proteins that share the same fold but are very dissimilar at the sequence level. For proteins to share a common fold some crucial interactions should be maintained despite insignificant sequence similarity. Since the interactions are because of the biophysical properties of the amino acids, we should be able to detect descriptive patterns for folds at such a property level. In this line, the main focus of our research is to analyze such proteins and to characterize them in terms of their biophysical properties. Protein structures with sequence similarity lesser than 40% were selected for ten different subfolds from three different mainfolds (according to CATH classification) and were used for this analysis. We used the normalized values of the 49 physio-chemical, energetic and conformational properties of amino acids. We characterize the folds based on the average biophysical property values. We also observed a fold specific correlational behavior of biophysical properties despite a very low sequence similarity in our data. We further trained three different binary classification models (Naive Bayes-NB, Support Vector Machines-SVM and Bayesian Generalized Linear Model-BGLM) which could discriminate mainfold based on the biophysical properties. We also show that among the three generated models, the BGLM classifier model was able to discriminate protein sequences coming under all beta category with 81.43% accuracy and all alpha, alpha-beta proteins with 83.37% accuracy. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Wireless Sensor Networks plays an important role in creating and developing smart environments. It includes sensors geographically distributed which are interconnected and hence forming a wireless network. Under any hazardous and danger prone situations, these sensors can detect the event occurred and inform the nearest service zones (base station). In construction sites for fence monitoring, when an event occurs around the fence, the nearby sensor nodes detect the event and pass this information to the neighbouring nodes until it reaches the nearest base station (service zones) using Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) protocol. The events are classified using classification algorithm implemented at each sensor node. Since power consumption is an important criterion, the communication among the nodes should be energy efficient and the proposed system achieves around 13% less energy consumption. To simulate this environment, NETSIM simulation tool is used and the occurred events are classified into critical or non-critical events. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Biodiesel is a fuel containing mono-alkyl esters which are derived from vegetable oils or animal fats. Biodiesel fuels are well-adopted now a day's having multiple benefits such as a renewable energy source, less pollutant emissions of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and particulate matter and so on. The oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions reported in the literature are ambiguous for biodiesel blended fuels with reference to baseline diesel NOx. Authors have come out with different conclusions of no change in NOx, a decrease NOx and an increase in NOx. This study aims to reduce NOx emission of palm oil methyl ester blended with diesel fuel (B20), by using Cetane number improver-di-tert-butyl peroxide (DTBP) and to improve ignition performance of the test fuel. Single cylinder, four stroke, water cooled diesel engine loaded by eddy current dynamometer was used for this study. The engine was run with diesel, B20 fuel and B20 with 1% DTBP additive by volume basis. The performance, combustion and emission results were compared. The results revealed that B20 with additives shows an increased thermal efficiency by 2–3.5% and decrease specific energy consumption by 10–15% compared to diesel and B20 fuel. Significant reduction of CO and NOx in trade off with slight increase in HC for the B20 fuel without additives was observed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Trace level detection of acetaldehyde vapour in a real time environment is highly essential, since it causes various illnesses and disorders once it exceeds the human permissible limit. Additionally, acetaldehyde is one of the predominant markers of fruit and vegetable spoilage levels. Therefore it is vital to develop relatively low cost, highly selective and room temperature operating acetaldehyde sensors. In this regard, we have fabricated a room temperature acetaldehyde sensor using fluorine-doped ZnO nanostructured thin film. Further, the investigations were carried out to study the influence of fluorine doping on the structural, morphological, optical, electrical and room temperature vapour sensing characteristics of ZnO thin film. Structural analysis revealed the formation of a hexagonal wurtzite structure for all the undoped and fluorine-doped ZnO samples. Average crystallite size and micro-strain were decreased and increased respectively with an increase in fluorine-dopant concentration. The film deposited with 4 wt.% fluorine-dopant concentration was found to be highly selective towards 100 ppm of acetaldehyde with a maximum response of 4.8 at room temperature. Response and recovery times were observed to be 18 and 25 s respectively towards 100 ppm of acetaldehyde. © 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The present study explores the anti-virulent and antibiofilm potency of chitosan extracted from the shells of the marine crab Portunus sanguinolentus against Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The chemical characterization results revealed that the extracted chitosan (EC) has structural analogy to that of a commercial chitosan (CC). The extracted chitosan was found to be effective in reducing the staphyloxanthin pigment, a characteristic virulence feature of MRSA that promotes resistance to reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, Confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) revealed that EC exhibited a phenomenal dose dependent antibiofilm efficacy against mature biofilms of the standard as well as clinical MRSA strains and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) confirmed EC had a higher efficacy in disrupting the thick Exopolysaccharide (EPS) layer than CC. Additionally, EC and CC did not have any cytotoxic effects when tested on lung epithelial cell lines. Thus, the study exemplifies the anti-virulent properties of a marine bioresource which is till date discarded as a biowaste. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={p-CA is a naturally occurring phenolic acid present in most plants and in all commonly consumed vegetables and fruits. Here we demonstrated the anti-cancer effect of the food borne phytochemical p-CA both in vitro and in vivo models of colon cancer using growth rate and tumor incidence as endpoints. Glucose regulated protein (GRP78) induction and UPR activation plays a key role in oncogenic progression, therefore increased dependence of cancer cells on these UPR signaling pathways for survival can be exploited for anti-cancer research. Hence we investigated the effect of p-CA on Grp78 a molecular chaperone often upregulated in colon cancer and its impact on unfolded protein response (UPR). Administration of the procarcinogen 1,2- dimethylhydrazine (DMH) causes Grp78 upregulation and tumor adaptation via UPR activation. The adaptive activity of UPR activates antiapoptotic NF-κB that results in upregulation of the markers of inflammation and angiogenesis. Supplementation of p-CA downregulated Grp78 and activated UPR mediated apoptosis both in in vitro and in vivo models of colon cancer. Further we observed that p-CA significantly reduced inflammation by decreasing the expression of cytokines COX-2, IL-6, TNF-α and PGE2 as analyzed by q-PCR and also reduced the expression of p-p65 and p-IκBα as analyzed by western blot. Further mechanistic insights revealed that p-CA inhibits Grp78 upregulation in cancer cells through activation of PERK-eIF2α-ATF-4-CHOP pathway that culminates in apoptosis inducing effect of p-CA. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

For this purpose, nine different mixes were fabricated with hooked end and crimped steel fibres at a dosage of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 percentage and tested under pendulum impact test. The impact energy dissipation capacity is assessed based on test (Charpy U-notch) procedure suggested by ASTM E23. Also, an analytical model was adopted to predict the impact energy dissipation value of UHPFRC and its performance is verified against experimental results. Based on the test results, the impact energy dissipation capacity of the mixtures containing crimped and hooked end steel fibres were significantly higher than that of Plain Concrete (PC). The hooked end steel fibres had an increased impact energy dissipation capacity compared to crimped steel fibres, which implies that hooked end steel fibre is more appropriate for enhancing the impact energy dissipation of UHPFRC. Also, the modelling data compared well with experimental data for the fibre volume fraction beyond 0.5%. © 2017, Korean Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract={Pure and Fe doped ZnO nanoparticles were prepared by a facile and cost-effective co-precipitation method. The X-ray diffractograms (XRD) reveal that the grown nanoparticles are hexagonal in structure and the crystallite sizes are in the range of 27–28 nm. The transmission electron microscope (TEM) micrographs confirmed the spherical nature of the grown particles and the Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) studies confirmed the presence of Zn–O bonding in the prepared nanoparticles. Additionally, the presence of the constituent elements is confirmed with XPS analysis. The optical bandgap of the prepared nanoparticles are calculated as 3.28, 3.19 and 3.08 eV for ZnO, ZnO–Fe 10 at.% and ZnO–Fe 20 at.%, respectively. The photocatalytic dye degradation efficiency against methylene blue, is 68.52, 73.96, and 87.92, respectively. To validate the photocatalytic activity, a DFT based calculation was performed to measure the band edge positions of the pure and Fe doped ZnO nanostructures, and the obtained results are well supported by the experimental results. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={In the recent decades, nanotechnology has become an important research field of modern material science. Green synthesized nanoparticles have garnered wide interest due to its inherent features like rapidity, eco-friendly and cost-effectiveness. For the first time, Zinc Oxide nanoparticles were successfully synthesized using Atalantia monophylla leaf extract in the present's investigation. The biosynthesized Zinc Oxide nanoparticles were characterized by UV- Vis spectrophotometer, Fluorescence spectrometer (PL) and their peaks were identified to be at 352 and 410 nm respectively. The morphology of the Zinc Oxide nanoparticles was characterized by TEM with EDAX. The X- ray diffraction (XRD) studies showed the crystalline nature and revealed the purity of Zinc Oxide nanoparticles. FTIR spectroscopy was used to analyze the specific functional groups responsible for reduction, stabilization and capping agents present in the nanoparticles. The success-ability of bacteria and fungi with Synthesized ZnO nanoparticles tested using agar well diffusion method were discussed. The bacterial and fungal destruction was better for ZnO nanoparticles than reported for plant extracts and standard drugs. Thus this study proves that Zinc Oxide nanoparticles would contain natural anti-microbial agents through green synthesis which may serve for the production of drugs for antimicrobial therapeutics. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The effect of biquadratic coupling on spin transfer torque-assisted magnetization switching in the pentalayer nanopillar device is studied by numerically solving the magnetization switching dynamics of the free layer governed by the Landau- Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski (LLGS) equation. Magnetization switching time in the absence of biquadratic coupling for an applied current density of 10 × 1011Am− 2 is 186 ps. Biquadratic coupling arises due to the uncorrelated roughness in the ferromagnetic layers and it reduces the switching time to 160 ps. Further, the impact of the period of roughness and spacer layer thickness on switching time are studied. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={This study was conducted to find out the anti-diabetic and hypolipidemic potential of ethanolic extract of Psidium guajava Linn leaves and its one of the important compound of caryophyllene in a streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetic rats. The rats were divided into eight groups. Diabetes was induced by STZ at a dosage of 60 mg/kg b.w. The various dosages of extract (100, 200, 300 mg/kg b.w), caryophyllene (300 mg/kg b.w) were injected and glibenclamide (3 mg/kg b.w) is used as a standard drug. After the treatment of the extract and caryophyllene the levels of blood glucose, HbA1c, glucose-6-phosphatase, fructose-1,6-bis phosphatase, total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), high density lipoprotein (HDL) were determined. Pancreatic tissue changes were noticed in all the groups. The present study showed that there was a significant reduction in blood glucose, HbA1c, glucose-6-phosphatase, fructose-1,6-bis phosphatase, TC, TG, LDL, VLDL and the enhancement was noticed in the level of insulin, glucokinase and HDL. Pancreas was damaged in diabetic induced rats and it altered to normal size and shape in the plant extract treated and caryophyllene treated groups. The results proved that the STZ induced diabetic rat models had revealed anti-diabetic and hypolipidemic effect treated with ethanolic leaf extract of P. guajava and caryophyllene. © 2018, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.

abstract={This paper presents different multi-carrier unipolar trapezoidal pulse width modulation strategies for a reduced switch asymmetrical multilevel inverter. The different strategies are phase disposition, alternative phase opposition and disposition, and carrier overlapping and variable frequency that involve triangular waves as carriers with a unipolar trapezoidal wave as a reference. The reduced switch, asymmetrical multilevel inverter operation was examined for generating the seven-level output voltage using Matlab/Simulink 2009b and the results were verified with a real-time laboratory-based experimental setup using a field-programmable gate array. Different parameter analyses, such as total harmonic distortion, fundamental root mean square voltage, and distortion factor, were analyzed with different modulation indices to investigate the performance of the selected topology. Unipolar trapezoidal pulse width modulation provides a higher root mean square voltage value. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={A pulsed, picosecond Nd:YAG laser with a wavelength of 532 nm is used to texture the surface of grade 5 titanium alloy (Ti—6Al—4V) for minimizing its wear rate. The wear properties of the base samples and laser surface textured samples are analyzed by conducting wear tests under a sliding condition using pin-on-disk equipment. The wear tests are conducted based on the Box—Benhken design, and the interaction of the process parameters is analyzed using response surface methodology. The wear analysis is conducted by varying the load, rotating speed of the disc, and track diameter at room temperature with a sliding distance of 1500 m. The results demonstrate that the laser textured surfaces exhibited a lower coefficient of friction and good anti-wear properties as compared with the non-textured surfaces. A regression model is developed for the wear analysis of titanium alloy using the analysis of variance technique. It is also observed from the analysis that the applied load and sliding distance are the parameters that have the greatest effect on the wear behavior followed by the wear track diameter. The optimum operating conditions have been suggested based on the results obtained from the numerical optimization approach. © 2018, Central South University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Application of artificial intelligence in Bio-Medical image processing is gaining more and more importance in the field of Medical Science. The bio medical images, has to go through several steps before the diagnosis of the disease. Firstly, the images has to be acquired and preprocessing has to be done and the data has to be stored in memory. It requires huge amount of memory and processing time. Among the preprocessing steps, edge detection is one of the major step. Edge detection filters the unwanted details in the image, and preserves the edges of the image, which describe the boundary of the image. In biomedical application, for the detection of the diseases, it is very essential to have the boundary detail of the acquired image of the organ under observation. Thus it is very essential to extract the edges of the images. Power is one of the main parameters that have to be considered while dealing with biomedical instruments. The biomedical signal processing instruments should be capable of operating at low power and also at high speed. In order to segregate the images into different levels or stage, we use convolutional neural networks for classification. By having a hardware architecture for image edge detection, the computational time for pre-processing of the image can be reduced, and the hardware can be a part of acquisition device itself. In this paper a low-power architecture for edge detection to detect the biomedical images are presented. The edge detection output are given to the system, which will diagnose the diseases using image classification using convolutional neural network. In this paper, Sobel and Prewitt, algorithms are used for edge detection using 180 nm technology. The edge detection algorithms are implemented using VLSI, and digital IC design of the architecture is presented. The algorithms for edge detection is co-simulated using MATLAB and Modelsim. The architecture is first simulated using CMOS logic and new method using domino logic is presented for low power consumption. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The problems with the design of hybrid micro-grids are system price and service quality. In this paper, we solve these problems by utilizing renewable resources optimally, maintaining State of Charge (SOC) in batteries. The proposed system also defines the lowest rate for power exchanged between the AC/DC micro-grids. Photovoltaic and wind energy are utilized as key resources in the system. Also, storage banks are coupled to both micro-grids and the fuel cell is the hold-up resource to maximize the consistency of the generation system. Supervisory controller ensures the maximum utilization of resources and by maintaining SOC to manage the exchange of power between micro-grids. This research focuses on power management in AC/DC micro-grid, and its optimization has been investigated by Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) algorithm.

abstract={Background Local drug delivery systems that adjust the release of immunosuppressive drug in response to the nature and intensity of inflammation represent a promising approach to reduce systemic immunosuppression and its side effects in allotransplantation. Here we aimed to demonstrate that release of tacrolimus from triglycerol monostearate hydrogel is inflammation-dependent in vivo. We further report that by loading the hydrogel with a near-infrared dye, it is possible to monitor drug release non-invasively in an in vivo model of vascularized composite allotransplantation. Materials and methods Inflammation was induced by local challenge with lipopolysaccharides in naïve rats 7 days after injection of tacrolimus-loaded hydrogel in the hind limb. Tacrolimus levels in blood and tissues were measured at selected time points. A near-infrared dye was encapsulated in the hydrogel together with tacrolimus in order to monitor hydrogel deposits and drug release in vitro and in vivo in a model of vascularized composite allotransplantation. Results Injection of lipopolysaccharides led to increased blood and skin tacrolimus levels (p = 0.0076, day 7 vs. day 12 in blood, and p = 0.0007 in treated limbs, 48 h after injection compared to controls). Moreover, lipopolysaccharides-injected animals had higher tacrolimus levels in treated limbs compared to contralateral limbs (p = 0.0003 for skin and p = 0.0053 for muscle). Imaging of hydrogel deposits and tacrolimus release was achieved by encapsulating near-infrared dye in the hydrogel for 160 days. The correlation of tacrolimus and near-infrared dye release from hydrogel was R 2 = 0.6297 and R 2 = 0.5619 in blood and grafts of transplanted animals respectively and R 2 = 0.6066 in vitro. Conclusions Here we demonstrate the inflammation-responsiveness of a tacrolimus-loaded hydrogel in vivo. Moreover, we show that encapsulating a near-infrared dye in the hydrogel provides a reliable correlation of tacrolimus and dye release from the hydrogel, and an accessible noninvasive method for monitoring drug release from hydrogel deposits. © 2018 Dzhonova et al.

abstract={Poly(vinyl amine) was utilized as a matrix for the synthesis of polymers bearing short polyamine chains (1-3 amine groups) grafted to the main macromolecular chain with long (eight atoms) spacers. The new polymers were characterized with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra, size exclusion chromatography and potentiometry. Poly(vinyl amine) was applied in the form of narrow molecular mass fractions and the modification proceeded without destruction of the main chain. Condensation of silicic acid in the presence of the polymeric amines gives rise to composite nanoparticles which are stable in aqueous medium. New polymers and composite nanoparticles effectively complex with DNA and RNA oligonucleotides and were found to display good internalization in cancer cells which indicates their promise towards gene delivery applications. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2018.},

abstract={With fast-growing interest in sustainable healthcare management, proper selection and evaluation of hospitals become highly essential. Generally, experts/decision-makers (DMs) prefer qualitative information for rating objects. Motivated by this idea, in this paper, a linguistic hesitant fuzzy set (LHFS) is adopted for elicitation of preference information. The LHFS provides qualitative preferences of DMs as well as reflects their hesitancy, inconsistency, and vagueness. Motivated by the power of LHFS, in this paper we present a new decision framework that initially presents some operational laws and properties. Further, a new aggregation operator called simple linguistic hesitant fuzzy weighted geometry (SLHFWG) is proposed under the LHFS context that uses the strength of power operators. Some properties of SLHFWG are also investigated. Criteria weights are estimated using a newly proposed linguistic hesitant fuzzy statistical variance (LHFSV) method, and objects are ranked using the newly proposed linguistic hesitant fuzzy VIKOR (visekriterijumska optimizacijai kompromisno resenje) (LHFVIKOR) method, which is an extension of VIKOR under the LHFS context. The practicality and usefulness of the proposal are demonstrated by using a hospital evaluation example for sustainable healthcare management. Finally, the strengths and weaknesses of the proposal are realized by comparison with other methods. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={We investigate the synthesis of bio-based hydrophilic and hydrophobic oligoesters, which in turn are derived from easily accessible monomers from natural resources. In addition to the selection of renewable monomers, Novozyme 435, an immobilized lipase B from Candida antarctica was used for the oligomerization of monomers. The reaction conditions for oligomerization using Novozyme 435 were established to obtain a moderate-to-good yield. The average number of repeating units and the molecular weight distribution of hydrophilic and hydrophobic oligoester were identified by using NMR spectroscopy, gel-permeation chromatography, and MS. The oligoester derived from a hydrophilic monomer self-assembled to form a viscous solution, which upon further heating resulted in the formation of a polymer by the intermolecular Diels–Alder reaction. The viscosity of the solution and the assembly of oligoester to form a fibrous structure were investigated by using rheological studies, XRD, and SEM. The molecular weight of the cross-linked polymer was identified by using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization–MS. The thermal properties of the bio-based polymers were investigated by using thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry. For the first time, the self-assembly-assisted polymerization of an oligoester is reported using the intermolecular Diels–Alder reaction, which opens a new avenue in the field of polymer science. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

abstract={The better and effective human–machine communication is ensured by performing affective computing. In the recent years, healthy research has been progressing in recognizing emotions by using various databases. This paper mainly emphasizes the effectiveness on the basis of using different sets of features and modeling techniques in evaluating the performance of multiple speaker-independent and speaker-dependent emotion recognition systems. It has become a challenging task to improve the performance of emotion recognition system, since EMO-DB Berlin database used in this work contains only ten speeches uttered by ten speakers in different emotions namely, Anger, Boredom, Disgust, Fear, Happiness, Sadness and Neutral. Speaker dependent and independent emotion recognition is done by creating models using clustering technique, Gaussian mixture modeling (GMM) and continuous density hidden Markov modeling (CDHMM) techniques for all emotions. The emotion recognition system is also evaluated for mel frequency cepstrum (MFCC) and concatenated MFCC with probability & shifted delta cepstrum (SDC), mel frequency linear predictive cepstrum (MFPLPC) and concatenated MFPLPC with probability & SDC and formants for clustering used as a modeling technique. These features provide complementary evidence in assessing the performance of the system based on VQ based clustering technique. This algorithm provides 99 and 100% as overall weighted accuracy recall (WAR) for performance evaluation with respect to correct identification of emotion for any one feature and modeling technique. © 2018 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature},

Correlation between micro hardness, microstructure and cooling rate of Pulsed Current TIG welding and Pulsed Current Activated TIG welding on Al-SiC composite has been studied. Combining the pulsed current TIG and activated TIG welding (PC-A-TIG) on Al-SiC composite showed very fine superior weld microstructure on PCATIG - SiO2 &amp; PCATIG - TiO2 which resulted in higher micro hardness values around 70 - 75 Hv. Micro hardness are observed in different locations of weld surface such as 1mm, 2mm &amp; 3mm below the weld surface and it also observed along the weld zone to heat affected zone upto 12mm for the profiling the micro hardness value around the weldment. Microstructure observed in weld centre for observed on weld zone &amp; heat affected zone. Minimum micro hardness value between 63 - 65 Hv found in PCATIG - MnO2, PCATIG - CaO &amp; PCATIG - MgO due to intermediate micro structure between coarse and fine. PCATIG - Al2O3 weld zone &amp; heat affected zone and heat affected zone of PCATIG - MnO2, PCATIG - CaO &amp; PCATIG - MgO shows coarse microstructure. This resulted in reduced micro hardness around 55 - 60 Hv. Coarse micro structure in weld zone and heat affected zone have least cooling rate. Fine micro structure in weld zone is due to higher cooling rate. Heat affected zone directly depends on temperature gradient between the weld centre and weldment heat affected zone. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={A three-wheeled auto-rickshaw (auto) remains one of the widely used modes of transport in parts of India. The vehicle structure places restriction in speed and it remains one of the 'safe' and cheap modes of urban commute medium in India. As part of data collection process, vibrations experienced in an auto-rickshaw ride were measured using 3 axis accelerometer fitted to the auto floor. A set of three maneuvers were planned in 4 different scenarios, namely, a stationary or idle mode, constant speed cruising(operating in speeds of 30,40 and 50 km/hour), a typical acceleration from idle to 30 km/hour and a typical braking or deceleration from 30 to 0 km/hour. The signals recorded were of the stationary random nature. The presence of 0.5 Hz dominant frequency in vertical and lateral vibrations denotes a higher tendency for motion sickness if travelled for a long period of time in auto. For auto operation at 50 km/hour, other modes were found at 10 Hz and 25 Hz, which indicate that the auto occupant would have a high chance of experiencing discomfort due to near human body resonance frequencies. Using SIMULINK, a single degree of freedom model of the vehicle was constructed for vertical vibrations and suspension parameters optimized for optimal ride. © 2018 SAE International.

abstract={Excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) materials are highly desirable because of their unique solid state fluorescence. Schiff base molecules with appropriate hydrogen donor functional group forms intramolecular H-bonding, a basis for ESIPT, however, only few molecules show solid state fluorescence. Herein, carbazole based Schiff base molecules 1 (2-((E)-(4-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)phenyl-mino)methyl)phenol), 2 (2-((E)-(4-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)phenylimino) methyl)-5-methoxyphenol), 3 (2-((E)-(4-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)phenyl-imino)methyl)-5-(diethylamino)phenol) and 4 (1-((E)-(4-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)phenylimino)methyl)naphthalen-2-ol)) were synthesized and ESIPT induced solid state fluorescence were correlated with solid state structural conformation and molecular packing. 2 and 4 exhibited solid state fluorescence whereas 1 and 3 did not show any fluorescence even though both 1 and 3 showed strong intramolecular H-bonding. Further structural comparison revealed that not only the intramolecular H-bonding facilitated ESIPT, the molecular conformation and resulting molecular packing also plays important role on the solid state fluorescence. Computational studies have also been performed to get the insight on the role of molecular conformation and organization. The non-planar twisted molecular conformation of 2 and 4 showed reversible mechanofluorochromism (MFC). Powder X-ray diffraction indicates that hard crushing converted crystalline to amorphous/partial amorphous phase whereas heating converts amorphous to crystalline. Thus the present study provides a structural insight for developing ESIPT based new Schiff base materials. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim},

abstract={Stimuli-responsive fluorescence modulation of organic fluorophores is closely related to their structural organization, noncovalent interactions, ability to adopt different conformation, and phase change in the solid state. Herein, we have synthesized aggregation enhanced emissive fluorophores, (5-(4-(diphenylamino)benzylidene)-2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxane-4,6-dione (1), 5-(4-(diphenylamino)-2-methoxybenzylidene)-2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxane-4,6-dione (2), and 5-(4-(diphenylamino)-4-methoxybenzylidene)-2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxane-4,6-dione (3)) and demonstrated molecular structure controlled tunable fluorescence (552 to 616 nm, φf = 14.6-41.8%) and stimuli responses. One showed thermofluorochromism between 586 and 558 nm at room and liquid N2. 2 showed tunable fluorescence via polymorphism (2a (550 nm) and 2b (610 nm)). Interestingly, hard crushed -2b polymorph showed two different mechanofluorochromism (MFC) when heated at 80 and 180 °C as well as topochemical conversion from 2b to 2a. In contrast, 2a and 3 displayed usual MFC. Crystal structure, powder X-ray diffraction, and differential scanning calorimetric studies indicated conformational, structural, and phase changes with different stimuli which are responsible for fluorescence switching/tuning. Computational studies revealed that optical band gap modulation depend on the molecular conformation and support the fluorescence modulation. © 2018 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Background: Fuchs’ endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) is a complex degenerative disease of the corneal endothelium with genetic predisposition. Pathogenic rare variants have been identified in SLC4A11, LOXHD1, ZEB1, and AGBL1. Association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and CTG trinucleotide repeat expansions in the intron of TCF4 gene to FECD has been studied across multiple ethnicities. Recently, genome-wide association studies have also identified KANK4, LAMC1, and ATP1B1 as novel loci for FECD. Here, we report the contribution of ZEB1 and LOXHD1 genes in our sporadic late-onset FECD cohort. Materials and methods: In the experimental study, coding regions of ZEB1 and LOXHD1 were screened by Sanger DNA sequencing in 52 late-onset and 5 early-onset FECD cases of Indian origin, recruited at a tertiary eye care center. Further, bioinformatics analysis was done. Results: One reported missense mutation, c.2522A>C; p.(Q841P), and one variant of uncertain significance (VUS), c.619A>G; p.(S207G), were identified in the ZEB1 gene. One VUS, c.6413G>Ap.(R2138Q), was observed in LOXHD1. A 3D structural bioinformatic analysis of the missense variant in LOXHD1 predicted the variant to affect the structure–function relationship of the protein. Discussion: While mutations in ZEB1 contributed to 2% of the late-onset FECD cases, the exact role of the two VUS identified in ZEB1 and LOXHD1 in FECD pathogenesis needs to be studied. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Protease inhibitors significantly control physiologically relevant protease activities. Protease inhibitors from marine microbial sources are unique due to their rough living environmental conditions. In the present study, a protein protease inhibitor (PI) was produced from marine Oceanimonas sp. BPMS22. Seven different media were screened for the growth of the bacterium and production of PI. Different carbon and nitrogen sources were screened and optimized for the specific protease inhibitor activity. Three different growth models were checked for the best fit of the bacterial growth. A modified Gompertz model was selected as the best model for the growth of Oceanimonas sp. BPMS22 with the maximum specific growth rate of 0.165 hr−1 and doubling time of 4.2 hr. The production of PI takes place during the non-growing phase of the bacterial growth. A kinetic model for the production of PI during non-growing phase was used for studying various process parameters. From the model, the maximum trypsin inhibitor formation rate of 0.3802 IU per mg of biomass per hour was observed at 49.91 hr. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Purified plant nutraceuticals afzelin and quercetrin from an edible plant- Crotolaria tetragona was employed for the fabrication of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) by a sunlight mediated process. From among a panel of strains tested, AgNPs displayed potent bacteriostatic and bactericidal effect against P. aeruginosa and S. typhimurium. Time kill studies revealed green synthesized AgNPs displayed comparable bactericidal effect with chemically synthesized AgNPs against S. typhimurium. Antibiofilm potential of AgNPs showed that they were highly effective at sub MIC concentrations in causing 50% biofilm inhibition against food borne pathogen S. typhimurium implying that antibiofilm effect is independent of antibacterial effect, which was evidenced by fluorescent imaging and SEM imaging. Mechanistic studies revealed that reduced cell surface hydrophobicity, decreased surface adherence, loss of membrane potential contributed to antibiofilm potential of afzelin/quercetrin AgNPs. Green synthesized afzelin/quercetrin AgNPs were also relatively less toxic and more effective in curtailing bioburden of S. typhimurium in infected zebrafish by > 3 log fold. Ability of sunlight reduced afzelin/quercetrin NPs to mitigate planktonic mode of growth in vitro and in vivo and curtail biofilm formation of S. typhimurium in vitro demonstrates its potential to curtail food borne pathogen in planktonic and biofilm mode of growth. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In the present work, experiments are done to understand the distribution of liquid film in Taylor flows occurring in small circular mini channels using laser-induced fluorescence. Gas–liquid Taylor flow is generated in 3 different channels of inner diameter 1.5, 2.1 and 3.1 mm to understand the effect of flow parameters and nature of forces on the liquid film thickness. Rhodamine-B, a fluorescent dye is mixed with water, the primary phase in the two-phase mixture and is excited by a pointed laser beam of wavelength 531 nm. The liquid film thickness with the excited fluorescent dye emits light at 610 nm which is captured using a CMOS high-speed camera. A long pass filter is used to filter the reflected laser light before being captured by the CMOS sensor camera. Subsequently, the image obtained is processed with a set of image processing techniques to determine the liquid film thickness. Different slug shapes are obtained for various combinations of flow velocities and are found to depend on the Bond number. Further, it is also found from the experiments that asymmetry in the flow regime is found to depend on the capillary forces acting on the flow and it increases with the capillary number. The film thickness is also found to vary across the air slug length and its distribution along the flow length is also presented. © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS},

Excited state absorption (ESA) assisted reverse saturable absorption (RSA) has been observed to be the reason for nonlinearity in the material. The nonlinear absorption has been observed to increase with increase in concentration of the solution. Thermal aberration rings have been formed by tightly focused Gaussian laser beam and also the beam suffered a self-phase modulation.

abstract={Electroencephalogram (EEG) is the recording of the electrical activity of the brain which can be used to identify different disease conditions. In the case of a partial epilepsy, some portions of the brain are affected and the EEG measured from that portions are called as Focal EEG (FEEG) and the EEG measured from other regions is termed as Non Focal EEG (NFEEG). The identification of FEEG assists the doctors in finding the epileptogenic focus and thereby they can plan for surgical removal of those portions of the brain. In this work, a classification methodology is proposed to classify FEEG and NFEEG. The Bern Barcelona database was considered and entropies such as Approximate entropy (ApEn), Sample entropy (SampEn) and Fuzzy entropy (FuzzyEn) as features which are fed into several classifiers. It was found that Non Nested Generalized Exemplers (NNge) classifier gave the highest classification accuracy of 99%, sensitivity of 99% and specificity of 99%, which is good comparing to proposed methods in the literature. In addition to the above, the maximum computation time of our features is 1.14 s which opens the window towards real time processing. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Foodborne pathogens cause serious health issues and have a strong impact on the economy of the country. In this context, quality testing of royal delicious apple by detecting pathogen contamination using an electronic nose, which contains an array of six ready-made sensors, has been proposed. To estimate the types of pathogens, fresh, half and completely contaminated apple samples were considered for bacterial studies. This study revealed the presence of Staphylococcus, Salmonella and Shigella bacteria, which were in the order of zero, 102, 103−104 CFU/mL. Further, the recorded headspace GC–MS spectra of contaminated samples confirmed the presence of bacterial spoilage markers namely acetone, ethyl acetate, ethyl alcohol and acetaldehyde. Voltage swing of 0.2 and 0.5 V was observed for half and completely contaminated apple samples respectively with reference to the fresh sample. Voltage responses of the sensors fed to Principal component analysis and Ward's method of hierarchical cluster algorithms helped to assess the quality of apple samples. By correlating the results of tri-layers namely bacterial count, GCMS data and classification results, reference table was developed and embedded in the ATmega processor of the electronic nose for real-time quality estimation of apple samples. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Present study is an attempt to explain the probable cause for 70-cm thick inverted sequence with the help of foraminiferal study. It is well known that dextrality of benthic species Rotalidium annectens changes directly with temperature. However, in study area the dextrally coiled specimens of this species gradually decrease upward within inverted sequence though, under normal conditions an upward increase was expected. Thus, this anomaly provides a clue for reasoning, because in early Holocene the temperature rose gradually with time. Therefore, it is hypothesized that this inverted sequence formed due to high energy events such as storms/tsunami action that eroded the original normal sequence of palaeoshelf sediments of early Holocene (~8,000 years BP), lifted it, transported and re-deposited them at present day shallower depth. © 2018, National Institute of Science Communication and Information Resources (NISCAIR).

abstract={In the recent decades, flavonoid metal complexes have been widely investigated for their multifaceted role in enabling osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. Silibinin complexed with copper(II) ion has been synthesized along with two mixed ligand complexes, namely copper(II) silibinin-phenanthroline and neocuproine as co-ligands, and their positive role in promoting neovacularization and osteoblast differentiation was investigated. Silibinin mono complex [Cu(sil)(H2O)2] and [Cu(sil)(phen)] showed similar UV–visible absorption in the region of 315 and 222 nm, whereas Cu(silibinin)(neocuproine) [Cu(sil)(neo)] showed a blueshift in the 320 nm transition. The involvement of carbonyl group present in the C-ring in metal ion chelation was identified by FT-IR analysis. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) depicted that [Cu(sil)(neo)] has higher thermal stability when compared with the control silibinin and Cu–silibinin mono, and phen complexes. Cu–silibinin complexes were found to be non-toxic to human MG-63 cells and mouse mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Our investigations identified the positive role of these complexes in promoting osteoblast differentiation by enhancing calcium deposition and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity at the cellular level and stimulation of osteoblastic marker genes such as Runx2, ALP, type 1 collagen, and OCN mRNAs expression at the molecular level. These complexes also supported angiogenesis by upregulation of VEGF and Ang 1 expression in mouse MSCs. Hence, our results suggest that the potential of these metal complexes along with mixed ligand complexes promoted osteoblast differentiation, thus warranting its candidature for bone tissue regeneration application. © 2018, SBIC.},

abstract={Electro-codeposition process is considered to be an advanced technique for development of composite coatings. In this study, Ni-weld slag composite coatings are prepared from nickel Watts bath using electrodeposition process. It is a novel approach under the utilization of weld slag particles for the preparation of composite coatings which are composed of ceramic patterns. The weld slag particles are embedded in nickel matrix using electrodeposition by adjusting the process parametic conditions. Taguchi L9 orthogonal array is chosen for experimental design by considering the three primary plating parameters, namely current density, temperature of bath and particle concentrations with three levels of each. In order to confirm the deposition, the deposited coatings are examined using optical microscope, SEM micrographs and EDX investigations. The Microhardness of deposits is evaluated using Vickers microhardness tester with the applied testing load of 100-gram force. The direct effects and significances of plating parameters on the microhardness have been explored using the signal to noise ratio, mean effect studies and analysis of variance. The process parameters are ranked by position through the significance studies. The Ni-weld slag particles produces greater microhardness values than pure nickel coating. © 2018, The Indian Institute of Metals - IIM.},

abstract={The utilization of composite materials has nowadays increased in aerospace applications due to their less weight and superior mechanical properties. Nevertheless, machining of composite materials without damage is quite challenging through conventional system due to their inherent heterogeneity, anisotropy, and thermal sensitivity. To overcome this problem, abrasive water jet machining process can be employed. It is a non-conventional machining processes with high accuracy, high flexibility and with no heat generation. However, there are more challenges in cutting fiber reinforced plastics with this technique. Hence, this work deals with the assessment of the optimum process parameters in abrasive water jet cutting of carbon fiber reinforced plastic composite. Cutting experiments were conducted by varying input parameters such as the traverse rate, standoff distance on three laminates of different thickness. Analysis of variance through response surface methodology technique was used to study the effect of each input parameters on the output responses such as kerf taper and surface roughness. Optimum parameters that provide the best machining quality were found using numerical and graphical optimization techniques. The results showed that increasing the traverse rate results in increased surface roughness and taper angle of the cut kerf. Hence lower traverse rate is preferable when machining quality is of high importance. © 2017, The Author(s) 2017.},

abstract={Introduction and Aim: : The primary mode of commutation of students from rural areas to reach students located in the urban areas is by bicycle. This necessitates the need for an ergonomically designed bicycle to avoid musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), enhance comfort and improve the performance of the riders. The objective of the present study is to identify the discomfort level in different body segments by comparing riding posture on the rigid frame (RF) and sports (SP) cycle using Rehabilitation Bioengineering Group Pain Scale (RBGPS). Materials and Methods: Eighty school girls (Age group of 17 years) volunteers participated in this study. RBGPS pain scale is used to quantify recognized discomfort levels at ten body areas (i.e., neck, back, wrists/ hands, legs, and shoulders). Results: The participants who rode RF bicycle have found significantly (p < 0.05) high pain at the leg and mid-back portion of the body. Most of the schoolgirl is significantly (p < 0.05) affected by low back pain (LBP) due to SPbicycle riding. Conclusion: SP bicycle involved poor riding posture, where riders tend to bend forward which results in severe back pain. This study helps in improving the ergonomic standard of bicycle design for reducing MSDs for school girls. © 2018 Indian Association of Biomedical Scientists. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Purpose: Compliance to spectacle wear is vital to elimination of avoidable blindness among schoolchildren. This study aims to understand the barriers to compliance and strategies to overcome the barriers from the perspectives of the service providers of the school vision-screening model. Methods: A snapshot qualitative study using focus group discussions (FGDs) was conducted among the service providers including eye care professionals (ECPs) and social workers that are part of the school screening program. Sessions were audio recorded and transcribed. Themes were formed following inductive coding using a conceptual framework. Results: Out of the three FGDs, two were with ECPs and one with social workers. Four subthemes identified under the barriers were poor awareness, spectacle-related, psychosocial, and financial barriers. Unique barriers according to the service providers included nonuse of spectacles by asymptomatic children, children with unilateral refractive errors and those with emmetropic parents. Service providers also brought out parent's feelings of guilt, doubts about their children's impaired vision, the negative self-image among children, and difficulties in obtaining funding to support the costs of screening. Solutions that emerged included the personal visit of professionals for spectacle distribution and counseling parents, demonstration of improvement in vision for activities that were difficult for the children without spectacles and rewarding, and role modeling of compliant children. Conclusion: This study had identified unique barriers and solutions from the perspectives of the service providers. The suggested strategies would aid in an effective schoolchildren vision screening practice to enhance compliance to spectacle wear. © 2018 Medknow Publications. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Tin disulfide (SnS2) thin films deposited using by nebulizer spray pyrolysis method (NSP) with different carrier gas pressure (as 0.078, 0.068 and 0.058 Pa) at 325 °C is reported. The prepared films were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectrum, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, EDAX, UV–Vis spectroscopy and photoluminescence analysis. Electrical properties study done by Hall effect measurements for the films deposited at various carrier gas pressures is also reported. Structural and surface morphological analyses showed highly crystalline pure phase of SnS2 thin films with relatively low surface roughness. Hall measurements revealed that the conductivity and mobility are in the range from 0.00007 to 15 (Ω−1 cm−1) and 16 to 37 (cm2 Vs−1), respectively. These results suggest that, using the optimized carrier gas pressure and other nebulizer spray parameters such as substrate temperature and nebulizer nozzle to substrate distance, a device quality conformal deposition of tin disulfide thin film which is essential for the thin film solar cell structures can be prepared using NSP method. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Zinc silibinin complex [Zn(sil)(H2O)2] and mixed ligand zinc complexes such as Zn(silibinin)(phenanthroline) [Zn(sil)(phen)], and Zn(silibinin)(neocuproine) [Zn(sil)(neo)] have been synthesized and characterized. The UV–vis spectra of the Zn(II) complexes showed a considerable shift in the intra-ligand transition. From the IR spectra, it is clear that carbonyl group in the C-ring is involved in the metal chelation besides A/C-ring hydroxyl group. Thermal gravimetric analysis showed that [Zn(sil)(neo)] has higher thermal stability compared to the other two Zn(II) complexes. The potential biological activities of the synthesized complexes were studied systematically. In osteoblast differentiation, silibinin and Zn-silibinin complexes enhanced osteoblast differentiation at the cellular level by increasing calcium deposition and ALP activity, and at molecular level increased osteoblast markers include Runx2, type 1 col, ALP and OC mRNAs expression. Additionally, Zn-silibinin complexes showed promising effects on osteoblast differentiation by regulating miR-590/Smad7 signaling pathway. Among the complexes, Zn(sil)(phen) showed more stimulatory effect on osteoblastic differentiation. These complexes also exhibited angiogenic property by increasing VEGF and Ang 1 expression in mouse MSCs and antibacterial activity against E. coli (Gram-negative) and S. aureus (Gram-positive) strains. Thus, the present study demonstrated that the Zn-silibinin complexes exhibit great potential as a pharmacological agent for bone tissue engineering. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Wireless networks expanded its applications in our day to day life. The wireless networks are open medium and hence are vulnerable to various security attacks. Here, we discuss about one of the multimedia data i.e., audio data. In this modern world audio watermarking is very much important in voice communication for real time application like transferring confidential information between officials to maintain secrecy etc., The practical challenges for watermarking includes requirement analysis, fast, robustness, imperceptibility and robustness. The watermarking applications can be divided into hardware based watermarking systems and software based watermarking systems. The watermarking hardware chip can be integrated with TV setup box, mobile phone, digital camera. The software based watermarking systems are more popular, easy to implement and cheaper. The general applications of watermarking includes copyright protection, authentication, fingerprinting, annotation watermarking, source tracking, integrity protection, broadcast monitoring, enforcement of usage policy. In this paper, an audio watermarking algorithm based on DWT and hamming windowing technique can be used for protecting intellectual properties from unauthorized copying is proposed. This paper deals about embedding an image into audio. The algorithm uses the discrete wavelet transform(DWT), image decomposition techniques and hamming windowing techniques. It embeds the watermarking pixel's value inside the wavelet coefficient of host audio. The watermarked audio signal and the original audio signal resembled each other closely. Experimental results illustrated that the proposed approach is able to withstand the various security attacks. © TJPRC Pvt. Ltd.},

abstract={Idiopathic scoliosis treatment depends on the accurate assessment of the Cobb angle, which is usually performed manually. Manual measurements, however, can lead to observer variations, which depend on the correct selection of the curvature superior and inferior vertebrae in order to draw the needed lines for Cobb angle measurements. In this paper, we are proposing an algorithm to measure the Cobb angle semi-automatically. The algorithm is based on two processing phases in which each column in the raw X-ray image is reduced to two points representing the end points of the spine and containing its general structure and outline. These points are then used to fit a fifth-order polynomial. We hypothesize that the deflection points of the fitted curve represent the superior and inferior vertebrae of the scoliosis curvature. The deflection points were used to calculate the Cobb angle. The algorithm was tested on X-ray images from 28 subjects (14 females and 14 males, average age of 15.6 ± 1.3 years) diagnosed with adolescence idiopathic scoliosis. Three manual measurements were obtained, with manually measured Cobb angles ranging from of 10° to 98°. The mean of the standard deviation of the manual readings and the algorithm results was 5.28° and 2.64°, respectively, with mean abs error of 6.6° and R value of 0.81. Excluding the cervical and rib cage touching scoliosis cases, the mean of the standard deviation of the manual readings and the algorithm results was 4.73° and 2.35°, respectively, with mean abs error of 3.78° and R value of 0.94. From the results, we can conclude that our proposed algorithm can minimize and simplify user intervention, thus allowing easier and more accurate Cobb angles measurements and resulting in a shorter diagnosis time and requiring no special skills from the user. © 2018 The Natural Computing Applications Forum},

abstract={MnCO3 as an electrode material for supercapacitor is slowly gaining momentum. So far, wet chemical methods have been used to synthesize MnCO3 for supercapacitor applications. The electrode fabrication of thus prepared MnCO3 requires a certain percentage of conductive additive and binder; both of them do not contribute significantly to the measured capacitance. Herein, we report electrodeposition of MnCO3 and its capacitance properties. MnCO3 has been electrodeposited from an aqueous mixture of MnSO4 and Na3C6H5O7 by chronopotentiometry. X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopic studies confirm the formation of MnCO3. Microscopic studies reveal the formation of micron-sized spherical particles by the agglomeration of sub-micron sized cubes. Electrodeposited MnCO3 delivers a specific capacitance of 194 F g−1 at a specific current of 0.5 A g−1 and demonstrates good rate capability. Further, it also exhibits high cycling stability over 10,000 cycles with retention of 92% of its initial specific capacitance value and 100% coulombic efficiency. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

abstract={In boilers, there is a need of bent pipes to direct the flow of steam/air in and out of a boiler. Usually bent pipes are preferred than welded pipes. When a pipe is bent, wall thickness of the pipe tends to decrease on the outer side of the bending. When a pipe is not bent properly, it leads to excess wall thinning. Wall thickness is the main criteria that governs the strength of a pipe, because whenever a high-pressure fluid flows through the bend it should withstand the pressure. In cold bending at normal temperature, various fillers are used to reduce the effect of wall thinning. In incremental hot bending, the effect of wall thickness has been studied by varying bend radius of the pipe and percentage change in wall thinning and its effects are observed. © 2018 Engineers Australia},

abstract={Nowadays, mobile devices are used for various applications. Although mobile can perform many things, it is a resource restriction device (i.e.) facilities and processing speed are limited. While executing high computational tasks, processing time is high in mobiles due to its sequential task processing algorithm. Computational time of an application depends upon the number of machines (Virtual) involved. Virtualization in Cloud computing is an emerging concept (field) which provides solutions for many complex problems. By combining the merits of virtualization in mobile computing, overall efficiency can be increased. Computationally intensive heavy tasks can be offloaded to rich resourceful server which meets its requirements for time efficient processing. Offloaded tasks are time efficiently processed using virtualization in cloud computing where many VMs (Virtual Machines) are used to dynamically complete the given application using suitable algorithm. The main objective of this paper is to find optimized mapping between number of tasks offloaded, and virtualization in cloud resource. The proposed approach is implemented in Workflowsim which is a cloud resource simulator, and the data obtained is statistically analysed for optimized result. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Air pollution has become an environmental burden with regard to non-communicable diseases, particularly heart disease. It has been reported that air pollution can accelerate the development of heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Air pollutants encompass various particulate matters (PMs), which change the blood composition and heart rate and eventually leads to cardiac failure by triggering atherosclerotic plaque ruptures or by developing irreversible ischemia. A series of major epidemiological and observational studies have established the noxious effect of air pollutants on cardiovascular diseases (CVD), but the underlying molecular mechanisms of its susceptibility and the pathological disease events remain largely elusive and are predicted to be initiated in the cell organelle. The basis of this belief is that mitochondria are one of the major targets of environmental toxicants that can damage mitochondrial morphology, function and its DNA (manifested in non-communicable diseases). In this article, we review the literature related to air pollutants that adversely affect the progression of CVD and that target mitochondrial morphological and functional activities and how mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number variation, which reflects the airborne oxidant-induced cell damage, correlates with heart failure. We conclude that environmental health assessment should focus on the cellular/circulatory mitochondrial functional copy number status, which can predict the outcome of CVD. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.},

abstract={Agricultural production is affected by the infection of different pathogenic agents in the various crops. In order to improve productivity for benefitting growing population, early diagnosis and control of diseases using modern technology become important. Maize is one of the important agricultural crops which is affected by various diseases namely Cercospora leaf spot, common rust, leaf blight, etc. The diseases in the crop are identified by recognizing the symptomatic patterns on the leaves and image processing techniques are widely used for classifying such symptoms. In order to accomplish the task, 2000 visible images of maize leaves were obtained from the open access PlantVillage image database. The images are processed to obtain the bag of features and statistical histogram based textural features. The classification of diseases with the obtained features is done using multiclass support vector machine. This study also explored gray level co-occurrence matrix based textural features for the classification of diseases under the various configuration of the multiclass support vector machine. Classification using the bag of features yielded an average best accuracy of 83.7% while using combined statistical features yielded 81.3%. Attributed reason for increase or decrease in accuracy of identification of specific disease type and healthy leaf were also presented. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Extracting natural gas and crude oil from deep wells requires a thorough understanding of multi phase flow phenomena.

Gas-Liquid two-phase flow mixing and separation commonly occur in such oil exploration and recovery on a macro scale and in case of micro fluid reactors in a micro scale. In this paper, two-phase flow mixing and separation is analysed for a horizontal channel with internal diameter 2.50 mm and a length of 202.5 mm. The numerical results obtained during two-phase flow mixing are validated with experimental results by employing image processing techniques. A numerical model is developed to study mixing and separation characteristics of slug flow regime. The separation efficiency of the T-junction partial separator for various superficial velocities, viscosity, surface tension and separation angles is analysed.

Riskbased authentication, a form of multi factor authentication adapts itself according to the risk profile of the users. This paper puts forth the design of risk engine integrated with the system to examine the user's past login records and generate a suitable pattern using machine learning algorithms to calculate the risk level of the user. The risk level further decides the authentication method that the user will be challenged with.

Almost 80% of the lift force is produced by the wing structure in an aircraft. Because of the loading, wing structure tends to buckle and buckling reduces the load-carrying capability and the components may fail below the design limit load. In the present investigation, a standard transport aircraft wing is considered and buckling analysis is carried out. The initial design was found to buckle. So several design modifications were made to make the design safe in buckling. Various materials were used for wing construction. Numerous results obtained using finite-element analysis ANSYS software, comparison studies, and parametric studies are presented. © 2018 Engineers Australia},

As an effort to evaluate the 'real aura' of 'Panchagavya' as a capable nutrient cum immune protective tonic for plants especially to Tomato, 'grow bag' study has been carried out both with seed treatment and foliar spray of Panchagavya on the organically raised tomato plants. The results of above study are used to derive 5 fuzzy logic membership functions by converting the crisp data into fuzzy data and to defuzzify for generating results for Tomato yield. The fuzzy results confirm that Young age, with optimum application of Panchagavya with high disease resistance, high plant height and more no of fruits set is perfect membership combination for optimum output of Tomato yield. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={We have witnessed a drastic increase in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) in optical community in recent years. OFDM is a type of signal modulation. OFDM divides high data rate modulating stream into many slow modulated narrowband subcarriers. Thus, it is less sensitive to frequency fading. OFDM is used for many of the latest wireless and telecommunications. OFDM technique is used in Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB), HDTV, Wireless LAN. In OFDM the spectrum of individual subcarrier is overlapped with minimum frequency spacing, which is carefully designed so that each subcarrier is orthogonal to each other. In the 1980s, OFDM was studied for high speed modems digital mobile communication, and high recording. This paper deals with the Review of optical OFDM. © 2017 IEEE.},

But the negligence of the driver is the major factor of road accidents. In order to overcome this, an automatic protective headgear system for safe riding is suggested and implemented in this paper. This system includes a headgear controlled safety system using RF module to ensure that the bike rider wears a helmet.

abstract={Buildings built these days are made earthquake resistant. To test the efficiency of the buildings to withstand the seismic vibrations, a scaled model (or sometimes 1:1 prototype) is placed over a table called as 'shake table'. This shake table has 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) and motions or vibrations are imparted to this table using actuators to test the earthquake resistance of the building. The risk is that if the natural frequency of the shake table matches with the imparted frequency, there will be a resonance and the shake table will fail. To ensure that the natural frequency of the shake table is not within the range of frequency of earthquake vibration, modal analysis is performed. In this paper, a methodology is proposed how to do the modal analysis of a 6 DOF parallel manipulator based on RPRS topology which is used as a shake table. An FFT analysis is also performed to determine the predominant frequency of the imparted earthquake data on the shale table. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={The main objective of our paper is to increase the throughput and fairness index and to decrease the power level. At most prioroty is to Provide very high data rate and coverage in forth co ming generation wireless networks. We propose regenerative algorithm in order to avoid work load balancing in memory. Joint al-location of resources using Auction-based algorithms, namely profiles of power at the source node as well as relay nodes and hence subcarrier assignment profile for multiple users amplify and forward orthogonal frequency division multiple access systems. It is based on either the marginal or relative marginal increase of data rate uing the subcarrier, each user is said to submit a bid and this acts as the base for the first algorithm which is based on sequential single item auction. The first bidding techniques is said to maximize the sum data rate While the second bidding strategy is said to maximize the index of fairness. In the dual cases, the user who submits the highest bid is assigned with the subcarrier. The algorithm is said to proceed in a sequential fashion while and until all subcarriers are left assigned. In order that reducing the synchronized interactions between the base-station and the users, here proposed is a one-shot auction algorithm, where each user submits bids for all subcarriers only once based on the Shapley value, a familiar cooperative-game theoretic concept. Depending on an estimation of the Shapley value, the user is said to evaluate each subcarrier. Based on the bids submitted and by using an iterative algorithm that enhances the fairness index, the subcarriers are assigned. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms, hroughput and fairness indices are used. In order to reduce workload balance in the sensor memory, here proposed is a regenerative algorithm, where each user's data need to be stored in the memory. Numerical results are used to show the merits of each algorithm. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={It is great challenge to meet the needs of quality assessment on rice grains. Testing on quality is gaining importance in food industry for classifying and grading the grains. Since manual testing is time consuming, costly and inaccurate, machine vision based quality analysis of rice grains is preferred. In machine vision based testing, we take both physical (grain shape and size) and chemical characteristics (amylose content, gel consistency) for evaluation and grading of rice grains. Quality assessment is done by finding 1) the region of boundary and 2) the end points of each grain by measuring the length, breadth and diagonal size of grain. In this proposed image processing algorithm, quality and grading of rice grains were analysed using the average values of the features extracted and it was implemented in Mat Lab. © 2017 IEEE.},

First, the image is compressed using PCA and then DCT is applied to the reconstructed image acquired from PCA technique. The reconstructed image from the block based DCT method is further compressed through the DWT based Set Partitioning In Hierarchical Trees (SPIHT) compression technique. At last, output reconstructed image will be evaluated with variety of quality metrics. The proposed novel technique is evaluated with the various quality metrics namely PSNR, SC, SNR. The PSNR value of the proposed technique is high, when compared with other existing techniques.

abstract={Numerous technologies have been explored in developing and enhancing the current healthcare amenities. Particularly, incorporation of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in healthcare industry explored the possibilities to optimize the supply of all the available medical resources. It can also provide reliable, efficient healthcare services to the aged people, patients with physical disabilities and chronic illness. The proposed project is to design and develop an IoT-based healthcare system which is featured with Neuro Fuzzy self-learning method. The proposed system monitors the patients' physiological parameters as well as supports the medical professionals to diagnose the diseases as early as possible. The system will raise an alert signal in case of any abnormality and communicate with the caretakers as well as the doctors by sending message as tweets. The outcome of the system enables the healthcare professionals to optimize the usage of available medical resources and minimize the costs in monitoring the patients. The adaptive learning ability of the proposed system improves the forecasting accuracy and results in enhanced decisions in diagnosis of diseases. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is an innovative approach to connect various devices through the internet and use such an interconnection to implement highly beneficial functions. IoT is certainly one of the most widely researched topics and will continue to shape the approach we adopt to solve problems in the years to come. In this paper, an IoT-based system has been proposed to combat air pollution, which is particularly a cause of concern in the densely populated country e.g., India. An embedded system is used to connect several sensors that collect data on the surrounding environment. Based on the obtained data, a prediction algorithm is put forth to proactively implement a solution to any problem encountered. The collected data is stored in a MySQL database that can be queried whenever the relevant information is required. This model would analyze the data and report it to the users. The obtained results are evaluated using ThinkSpeak open data IoT platform with data analytics. A major advantage of the proposed system is its cost-effectiveness. Coupled with its scalable, dynamic and flexible nature, this model can be easily set-up and deployed in any area to monitor and control the quality of its environment. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={The Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problem is an interesting and dynamic area for research. Many researchers have contributed different methods for effective ranking of the alternatives. All these methods work with the background of crisp or fuzzy data. Recent research has widely used fuzzy data for representation and the popular among them is the Triangular Fuzzy Number (TFN). In this paper, we make efforts to solve the problem of selection of head nurse for health care using hybridized VIKOR method under TFN environment. The weights of the criteria are determined using Analytical Hierarchal Process (AHP) method. We now integrate AHP with VIKOR to form a hybrid framework for selecting a suitable head nurse for the health care. The strength of the framework is verified by comparing the proposed framework with other methods. Correlation inference shows that the proposed framework is consistent with the other state of the art schemes. We also infer that the proposed hybrid framework is a better choice for MCDM problems involving uncertainties and ambiguities. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={This study investigates the Human-Machine interaction in Banking Industry with special reference to Automated Teller Machines (ATM) services. The influence of technology over product innovation in banks is enormous. Banking services of the 21st century have more or less become a necessity, undeniably patronized by both rich and average well-to-do citizens of every country. The services provided are aimed at ensuring comfort, convenience and security of the customer, expressed in varied forms from mechanical to electronic, to ensure fast and rapid delivery of services intending at satisfying the customer. Indeed, customer satisfaction is critical in banking services. The level at which customers are satisfied with the services of the banks, extrapolate the future status of the banks. The present paper rests on the fact that customer satisfaction is one of the major factors in measuring the performance of the banks. The paper examines the relationship between various ATM facilities, factors affecting the choice of ATM and its interplay with customer satisfaction. The research study is based on the primary data for a period of 2016-2017. This research chooses a sample of 300 bank customers as the subject and collects data by simple random sampling. Data was obtained through survey questionnaires. The data was analyzed using SPSS 19.0 and SEM-PLS software. The Demographic Variables, Bank related Variable, Availability, Accessibility and Satisfaction are positively correlated. The Customer Satisfaction is heavily influenced by Availability, Accessibility of ATM services. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={The main motive of this research is to find the recognition and practice of Supply chain Technologies by organised retail outlets in the Indian Tier2 city Trichy, Thanjavur and Kumbakonam. Past researchers have found the value of Supply chain technologies on store operations of large retails, in tier1 cities of India but the impact of these practices on Tier2 city was not made as these locations are aiming towards the growth of this sector in the economy of our country. A questionnaire survey based on Likert scales was developed and administered at organized retail outlets in and around Trichy and Thanjavur. A total of 74 valid responses were collected. The collected data was tested using structural equation modelling. This study suggests that implementation of supply chain technologies is fairly related to the retail product pricing and retail operational efficiency. Understanding and application of supply chain technologies are observed with the small retailers. This research implies perceptual analysis measures of a store manager or store operators only. Future studies can expand on this research by analysing the actual data regarding the supply chain management and can predict the actual performance. This article is the initial attempt to study supply chain technologies among the organised retailer in the tier-2 cities of India. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanostructures were grown on glass substrates using hydrothermal technique followed by a sputter deposited ZnO seed layer. The influence of hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) concentrations on the growth of ZnO nanostructures and their room temperature sensing performance were investigated. Further, the non-mutually exclusive dual role of HMTA on the growth of ZnO nanostructures were evaluated by morphological studies. Various morphologies such as nanoprisms, nanoparticles decorated nanoprisms and nanodisks were observed concerning various molar concentrations of zinc acetate and HMTA. Protonation of HMTA acted as a capping agent, which offered a unique impact on the anisotropic growth of ZnO along the c-axis direction. Nanoparticles decorated nanoprisms showed good selectivity towards acetaldehyde vapor amidst ethanol, ammonia, and acetone, which was well supported by bond dissociation energy. The presence of increased number of junction types, densities, and networked structure showed a prospect towards better sensing performance. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The nature of interactions between the neutral, charged and substituted cubane, within cucurbituril host were analyzed employing the dispersion corrected density functional theory. The structural comparison between the inclusion complexes of CB7 and CB8 shows a best fit for the CB7. The computed Gibbs free energy for the formation of inclusion complexes by the neutral guests were close to the experimental estimate. The dicationic guest within CB has the highest strain energy with least strain on the host. The conceptual DFT based analysis ECT analysis shows a charge transfer from the host to guest in neutral systems, while for the dicationic guest an electron transfer from guest to host has been noticed, which was further conformed from the quantitative MESP values. The computed NICS values on the cubane, are not affected by the introduction of charge/substituents implying that cubane part act as a spacer group while the functional groups present on the cubane dictates the charge transfer. In AIM analysis, the ρ value is least for the complex cubane@CB7 and highest for the cubane functionalized dicationic complex@CB complexes. The NCI-RDG analysis for the inclusion complex with dicarboxylic guest, the spike at higher density region undergoes a shift, reflecting the increase in repulsive energy. In the inclusion complexes of CB7 the patch escalation in the NCI isosurface occurs evenly in CB7 than on the CB8 inclusion complexes, signifying the fit-induced extra stability of the CB7 inclusion complexes. EDA analysis shows that the Pauli repulsive energy increase with the increase in the size of the guest molecule and among the guest the dicationic has the highest repulsive energy. The presence of higher amount of electrostatic interactions in the dicationic complex has remunerated the dispersion contribution in the dicationic complexes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Phase change materials (PCMs) are energy storage materials which can be used for maintaining a controlled thermal environment for various applications in earth and space. PCMs are used in advanced technologies in aerospace cooling applications like heat exchangers and heat pipes for re-entry vehicles and spacecraft. Paraffin is a phase change material (PCM) commonly used for energy storage-related applications. Paraffin wax exhibits slow thermal response due to low thermal conductivity value (~0.2 W/m K for most paraffin waxes). In the present work, an attempt is made to fabricate a composite PCM using graphite powder. Such a composite material has enhanced thermal conductivity along with reduced melting period which are desirable properties of a PCM during solid to liquid phase change process. The reduction in melting period is indicated by the difference in change in temperature measured by the thermocouples during a specified time. The temperature variation and solid-liquid interface formation during the melting process are experimentally studied. The results showed that composite graphite powder with paraffin can improve the total phase transition time. © 2018 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.},

abstract={Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the effect and parametric optimization of process parameters during milling of glass fibre-reinforced plastics (GFRP) composites using grey relational analysis (GRA). Design/methodology/approach: Experiments are conducted using helix angle, spindle speed, feed rate, depth of cut and fibre orientation angle as typical process parameters. GRA is adopted to obtain grey relational grade for the milling process with multiple characteristics, namely, machining force and material removal rate (MRR). Analysis of variance is performed to get the contribution of each parameter on the performance characteristics. Findings: It is observed that helix angle and fibre orientation angle are the most significant process parameters that affect the milling of GFRP composites. The experimental results reveal that the helix angle of 45°, spindle speed of 3000 rpm, feed rate of 1000 mm/min, depth of cut of 2 mm and fibre orientation angle of 15° is the optimum combination of lower machining force and higher MRR. The experimental results for the optimal setting show that there is considerable improvement in the process. Originality/value: Optimization of process parameters on machining force and MRR during endmilling of GFRP composites using GRA has not been attempted previously. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Multispectral and hyper spectral image fusion aspires to improve the spectral information and spatial details. Previous fusion algorithms have concentrated on spectral information and spatial details, but those fused images have missed its sharpening. This paper is introduced the ripple type-II (RT-II) transform and deep neural network (DNN). RT -II transform can be decomposed both multispectral and hyper spectral images, then DNN are used for recognize the complementary features and sharpened the decomposed images. Then applied the fused rules for fuse the both images and applied inverse RT -II transform to get fused image. In this paper, the proposed method gets better entropy, standard deviation (SD), Correlation Coefficient (CC), Edge-Dependent Fusion Quality Index (EDFQI), Edge Based Similarity Measure (EBSM), Structural similarity (SSIM) as compared with other methods. The best way of analyzing the concepts of date and image fusion methods is to perform fusion based analysis in multimedia based tools.so that an end user can understand easily.

abstract={In honey bees, continuous foraging is accompanied by a sustained up-regulation of the immediate early gene Egr-1 (early growth response protein-1) and candidate downstream genes involved in learning and memory. Here, we present a series of feeder training experiments indicating that Egr-1 expression is highly correlated with the time and duration of training even in the absence of the food reward. Foragers that were trained to visit a feeder over the whole day and then collected on a day without food presentation showed Egr-1 up-regulation over the whole day with a peak expression around 14:00. When exposed to a time-restricted feeder presentation, either 2 h in the morning or 2 h in the evening, Egr-1 expression in the brain was up-regulated only during the hours of training. Foragers that visited a feeder in the morning as well as in the evening showed two peaks of Egr-1 expression. Finally, when we prevented time-trained foragers from leaving the colony using artificial rain, Egr-1 expression in the brains was still slightly but significantly up-regulated around the time of feeder training. In situ hybridization studies showed that active foraging and time-training induced Egr-1 up-regulation occurred in the same brain areas, preferentially the small Kenyon cells of the mushroom bodies and the antennal and optic lobes. Based on these findings we propose that foraging induced Egr-1 expression can get regulated by the circadian clock after time-training over several days and Egr-1 is a candidate transcription factor involved in molecular processes underlying time-memory. © 2018 Shah, Jain and Brockmann.},

abstract={In networks with lot of computation, load balancing gains increasing significance. To offer various resources, services and applications, the ultimate aim is to facilitate the sharing of services and resources on the network over the Internet. A key issue to be focused and addressed in networks with large amount of computation is load balancing. Load is the number of tasks"t" performed by a computation system. The load can be categorized as network load and CPU load. For an efficient load balancing strategy, the process of assigning the load between the nodes should enhance the resource utilization and minimize the computation time. This can be accomplished by a uniform distribution of load of to all the nodes. A Load balancing method should guarantee that, each node in a network performs almost equal amount of work pertinent to their capacity and availability of resources. Relying on task subtraction, this work has presented a pioneering algorithm termed as E-TS (Efficient-Task Subtraction). This algorithm has selected appropriate nodes for each task. The proposed algorithm has improved the utilization of computing resources and has preserved the neutrality in assigning the load to the nodes in the network. © 2018 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

The prediction of two phase or three phase flow patterns in the mini/micro channels finds its application in production process of such spherical polymers. In the present work a numerical model based flow analysis is done for creation of the spherical/non spherical dispersed air bubbles in a continuous liquid phase. The results are validated with experiments done in a similar liquid–gas flow experiments carried out in a glass mini channel of size 2.05 mm. The flow regime is recorded with a high speed camera.

abstract={The recent research on the therapeutic applications of sodium thiosulfate (STS) has gained importance in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Progressively through the present work, we have demonstrated that postconditioning of isolated rat heart subjected to ischemia-reperfusion injury using STS had preserved the mitochondrial structure, function, and number. Heart comprising of two mitochondrial subpopulations interfibrillar (IFM—involved in contractile function) and subsarcolemmal (SSM—involved in metabolic function), STS postconditioning imparted a state of hypometabolism to SSM, thereby reducing the metabolic demand of the reperfused heart. The IFM, on the other hand, provided the energy required to maintain contraction. Moreover, the hypometabolic state induced in SSM can lower the free radical release in addition to STS innate ability to act as an antioxidant and radical scavenger, all of which collectively provided cardioprotection. Therefore, drugs targeting IFM specifically or those reducing the energy demand for SSM can be suitable targets for myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={We report the density functional application of adsorption behavior of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from the different ripening stages of banana fruit on germanene nanotube (GNT). Initially, the geometric structural stability of GNT is ascertained and the tunable electronic properties lead to the application of GNT as a base material in order to know the adsorption features of VOCs. We further explored the adsorption behavior of VOCs on to GNT through charge transfer, adsorption energy and band gap variation. The energy band structure and density of states (DOS) spectrum shows a noteworthy variation upon adsorption of different VOCs on to the GNT. Also, the electron density variation is noticed upon adsorption of VOCs emitted from the banana on to the GNT base material. Besides, the difference in the energy band gap of GNT upon emission of VOCs from banana leads to the use of GNT as a chemiresistor to assess fruit freshness with adsorption studies. Moreover, we suggest the use of GNT to discriminate the fruit freshness of banana through the adsorption process of VOCs on to GNT. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={This paper proposes a multi-tier SegmEntation ECC Desegmentation (SEED) model to suit audio cryptosystem for Securing Audio sIgnal (SAIL) based on discrete wavelet transform and elliptic curve encryption. It is aimed with the prospect of enhancing the level of security in digital audio communication for unreliable public networks. The proposed SAIL system works as a multitier SEED model by performing segmentation, DWT compression, ECC encryption and desegmentation. In the reverse process, this multitier model proceeds with segmentation, decryption, decompression, and desegmentation. The novelty of this work relies on the adoption of ECC for encryption as it is first of its kind in audio streaming. The selection of appropriate ECC curve is a real challenge, and complex multiplication method has been applied. ECC has been chosen for encryption as it has been identified as a discrete logarithm problem which is resistant to be attacked by quantum computers. The performance of the recommended SAIL cryptosystem has been tested using different audio samples characterizing human voice, animal voice and Instrumental music. Analysis of the proposed model shows the effectiveness for fast audio encryption as it works on compressed data and also computationally simple. Various statistical analysis have been done on the proposed model, and the obtained result ratifies better level protection of audio signals from different security threats and can be recommended for multi channel audio processing. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Thin film memristor behavior depends on the choice of top and bottom electrode material and metal oxide layer. In the present work, the influence of the top and bottom electrode layers on the electric field-induced resistance switching phenomena of TiO2-based MIM was studied. Au/TiO2/NiCr and NiCr/TiO2/Au structures were fabricated by depositing TiO2 active layer by reactive dc magnetron sputtering technique between thermally evaporated NiCr and Au electrodes. TiO2 layer was sputtered with a cathode power of 150W keeping the other deposition parameters constant. TiO2 films were analyzed by X-ray diffractometer, field emission scanning electron microscopy and UV-Visible spectrophotometer to investigate their structural, morphological and optical behavior. Structural studies of the films reveal that the samples were amorphous. And the I-V analysis for the fabricated MIM structure was analyzed. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={Social behaviors are an integral part of team building. In this context, we propose a novel classification model that chooses an optimal classifier from the pool of classifiers for predicting the overall performance (OP). Secondly, the chosen classifier is used to investigate the impact of trust and personality on OP. To achieve these goals a pilot study with real time data from 442 respondents are collected from cross functional teams (CFTs) in India using an E-Questionnaire system. The results indicate that the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) method is an optimal classifier (A = 89.14%) with respect to other classifiers. We also infer that the predictors, trust and personality are most suitable for predicting OP with a direct relationship to OP and play an indispensable role; as a catalyst; for boosting OP. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={In this paper, we consider a single server feedback retrial queueing system with multiple working vacations and vacation interruption. An arriving customer may balk the system at some particular times. As soon as orbit becomes empty at regular service completion instant, the server goes for a working vacation. The server works at a lower service rate during working vacation (WV) period. After completion of regular service, the unsatisfied customer may rejoin into the orbit to get another service as feedback customer. The normal busy server may get to breakdown and the service channel will fail for a short interval of time. The steady state probability generating function for the system size is obtained by using the supplementary variable method. Some important system performance measures are obtained.

abstract={Micro (mi)RNAs are small regulatory RNA molecules involved in post-transcriptional silencing of their target mRNAs. In plants, these miRNAs target mRNAs coding for transcription factors and key regulators, thus modulating plant development, defence, and metabolic processes. miRNAs mostly originate from MIR genes that are transcribed to long primary (pri)miRNA transcripts by Pol II. These pri-miRNA transcripts fold-back to give rise to specific stem-loop structures that are cleaved by Dicer-like (DCL) proteins to Pre-miRNA intermediates. Pre-miRNAs are precisely processed into mature miRNA/miRNA* duplex of 20-22-nt length by DCL1 with the help of few accessory proteins. It is not known why only one or rarely more than one miRNA results from these long dsRNA precursors. In this review, we discuss recent studies including our unpublished work on structural and sequence determinants of plant miRNAs that distinguish them from their precursor regions. These determinants play a major role in accurate and precise dicing of miRNAs from their precursors, thus contributing to abundance and stability of mature miRNAs. © Printed in India.},

abstract={This study presents the implementation of an all-optical binary logic half adder by employing a triple core photonic crystal fiber (TPCF). The noteworthy feature of the present investigation is that an identical set of TPCF schemes, which demonstrated all-optical logic functions in our previous report, has revealed the ability to demonstrate the successful half adder operation. The control signal (CS) power defining the extinction ratios of the output ports for the considered symmetric planar and triangular TPCFs is evaluated through a numerical algorithm. Through suitable CS power and input combinations, the logic outputs are generated from extinction ratios to demonstrate the half adder operation. The results obtained display the significant influence of the input conditions on the delivery of half adder operation for different TPCF schemes considered. Furthermore, chloroform filled TPCF structures demonstrated the efficient low power half adder operation with a significant figure of merit, compared to that of the silica counterpart. © 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The authors describe an amperometric biosensor for the determination As(III) and Cd(II) based on the inhibition of the enzyme acetylcholineesterase (AChE). A platinum electrode was modified with ruthenium(II)-tris(bipyridyl), graphene oxide and AChE and then showed redox peaks at 0.06 and 0.2 V vs Ag/AgCl in the presence of acetylthiocholine chloride (ATChCl). Amperometry unveiled a steady-state turnover rate with the release of thiocholine. In the presence of arsenic(III) and cadmium(II), AChE showed an inhibitive response at 0.214 and 0.233 V vs Ag/AgCl, respectively. The electrode exhibits a detection limit and linear range of 0.03 μM and 0.05–0.8 μM for As(III) and 0.07 μM and 0.02–0.7 μM for Cd(II), respectively. Type of inhibition and inhibition constants induced by As(III) and Cd(II) on the catalytic sites of AChE were determined from Dixon and Lineweaver-Burk plots. The modified electrode was applied to the determination of As3+ and Cd2+ in river, tap and waste water, and the results proved that the method is sensitive and can be an alternative to chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques.

abstract={Numerous genes have been associated with schizophrenia. In particular, Neuregulin-1 (NRG1) has been widely implicated. Specifically, a 7-marker haplotype called HAPICE in NRG1 is correlated with schizophrenia in many ethnic groups. However, the association of these markers with endophenotypes has shown many contrasting results. India, which harbours one sixth of the global population, is poorly represented in these studies. The present pilot study is aimed to identify association of NRG1 genetic variants with schizophrenia and neuro-cognitive features of the disorder. For this, 148 patients and 156 controls were enrolled and four NRG1 SNPs (rs7812451, rs35753505, rs62510682 and rs6994992) were genotyped. Significant associations of SNPs rs7812451 (Allele-A; OR:2.7, P &lt; 0.0001) and rs35753505 (Allele-C; OR:1.7, P = 0.0015) with schizophrenia was observed.

abstract={Chemotherapy is one of the most popular therapeutic strategies to treat cancer. However, cancer chemotherapeutics have often been associated with impairment of the immune system, which might consequently lead to an augmented risk of autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis. Though the accurate mechanistic facets of rheumatoid arthritis induction have not been interpreted yet, a conglomeration of genetic and environmental factors might promote its etiology. What makes the scenario more challenging is that patients with rheumatoid arthritis are at a significantly elevated risk of developing various types of cancer. It is intriguing to note that diverse cancer chemotherapy drugs are also commonly used to treat symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. However, a colossal multitude of such cancer therapeutics has demonstrated highly varied results in rheumatoid arthritis patients, including both beneficial and adverse effects. Herein, we attempt to present a holistic account of the variegated modalities of this complex tripartite cross-talk between cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and chemotherapy drugs in order to decode the sinuous correlation between these two appalling pathological conditions. © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS},

abstract={The prevalence and fatality rates with biofilm-associated candidal infections have remained a challenge to the medical fraternity despite major advances in the field of antifungal therapy. Traditionally, essential oils (EOs) from the aromatic plants have been found to be excellent therapeutic agents to treat fungal ailments. The present study explores the antivirulent and antibiofilm effects of under explored leaf EOs of Indian patchouli EO extracted from Pogostemon heyneanus (PH), Indian cassia from Cinnamomum tamala (CT) and camphor EO from C. camphora (CC) against Candida species. The EOs were investigated for its efficacy to disrupt the young and preformed Candida spp. biofilms and to inhibit the yeast to hyphal transition, a hallmark virulent trait of C. albicans. The ability of these EOs to inhibit metabolically active cells was assessed through XTT assay. Of these three EOs, CT EO showed enhanced biofilm inhibition than others and hence it was further selected to study its biomass inhibition potential and exopolysaccharide layer disruption ability. The CT EO reduced the biomass of the preformed biofilms of all three Candida strains, which was supported by confocal microscopy. It also disrupted the exopolysaccharide layer of the Candida strains as shown by scanning electron microscopy. The present findings validate the effectiveness of EOs against the virulence of Candida spp. and emphasize the pharmaceutical potential of several native but yet unexplored wild aromatic plants in the prospect of therapeutic application. © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS},

abstract={This paper proposes a non-iterative method to perform the simulation of water distribution systems with pressure driven demands using EPANET2 without the need to use its programmer’s toolkit. The method works for single period simulation (snapshot) and for extended period simulation (EPS) as well. It is based on the addition of a flow control valve (FCV), a throttle control valve (TCV), a check valve (CV) and a reservoir to each demand node in the network, in addition to a list of simple controls to modify the setting of the FCV and TCV in each time step. The main advantages of this approach are: 1. the source code of EPANET2 is not modified, 2. the toolkit functions are not needed for the simulation and they remain available for further uses, 3. the extended period simulation (EPS) is performed by EPANET2 and it carries tank levels, demand variation and other time-changing variables internally. The performance of the method is tested in two benchmark networks and a real size network with pumps, tanks and a 24 h demand pattern. The results show that the method computed the pressures and outflows accurately and that the computational time required is not significantly higher than a demand driven execution in most cases. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic and progressive movement disorder affecting patients in large numbers throughout the world. As PD progresses, the affected person is unable to control movement normally. Individuals affected by Parkinson's disease exhibit notable symptoms like gait impairments and tremor occurrences during different stages of the disease. In this paper a novel approach has been proposed to diagnose PD using the gait analysis, that consists of the gait cycle, which can be broken down into various phases and periods to determine normative and abnormal gait. Initially, the raw force data obtained from physionet database was filtered using a Chebyshev type II high pass filter with a cut-off frequency 0.8 Hz to remove noises arising from the changes in orientation of the subject's body and other factors during measurement. The filtered data was used for extracting various gait features using the peak detection and pulse duration measuring techniques. The threshold values of the gait detection algorithm were tuned to individual subjects. From the peak detection algorithm, various kinetic features including the heel and toe forces, and their normalized values were obtained. The pulse duration algorithm was developed to extract different temporal features including the stance and swing phases, and stride time. Tremor is a common symptom in PD. Tremor is an involuntary movement of body parts. At first the tremor may appear in a specific body part like an arm, leg or one side of the body and later it may spread to both sides. This rest tremor is a cardinal sign of PD. An average accuracy of 92.7% is achieved for the diagnosis of PD from gait analysis and tremor analysis is used for knowing the severity of PD. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) are biodegradable polymers found in the cellular masses of a wide range of bacterial species and the demand for PHA is steadily growing. In this work we have produced PHA from a low-cost substrate, Calophyllum inophyllum oil, using Cupriavidus necator. Effects of various process parameters such as Oil concentration, Nitrogen source and inoculum size on the production of PHA were studied using Response Surface Methodology. A quadratic equation was used in the model to fit the experimental data. It was found that the model could satisfactorily predict the PHA yield (R2 = 99.17%). Linear, quadratic and interaction terms used in the model were found to be statistically significant. Maximum PHA yield of 10.6 g L−1 was obtained under the optimized conditions of oil concentration - 17.5%, inoculum concentration - 50 mL/L and nitrogen content - 1.125 g L−1, respectively. The product obtained was characterized using FTIR and NMR to confirm that it was PHA. The results demonstrate that C. inophyllum oil, a non-edible oil, can be potentially used as a low-cost substrate for the production of PHA. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The recently published CRAFT (complete reduction to amplitude frequency table) technique converts the raw FID data (i.e., time domain data) into a table of frequencies, amplitudes, decay rate constants, and phases. It offers an alternate approach to decimate time-domain data, with minimal preprocessing step. It has been shown that application of CRAFT technique to process the t1 dimension of the 2D data significantly improved the detectable resolution by its ability to analyze without the use of ubiquitous apodization of extensively zero-filled data. It was noted earlier that CRAFT did not resolve sinusoids that were not already resolvable in time-domain (i.e., t1max dependent resolution). We present a combined NUS–IST–CRAFT approach wherein the NUS acquisition technique (sparse sampling technique) increases the intrinsic resolution in time-domain (by increasing t1max), IST fills the gap in the sparse sampling, and CRAFT processing extracts the information without loss due to any severe apodization. NUS and CRAFT are thus complementary techniques to improve intrinsic and usable resolution. We show that significant improvement can be achieved with this combination over conventional NUS–IST processing. With reasonable sensitivity, the models can be extended to significantly higher t1max to generate an indirect-DEPT spectrum that rivals the direct observe counterpart.

abstract={Analysing pre-earthquake signals using satellite technology are getting importance among the scientific community, since round-the-clock survey for the wider region is possible compared to ground-based monitoring techniques. Several scientists are involved in various satellites and ground-based technologies to decode the complex physical mechanism of the earthquake process since 1980. They involved in measuring anomalous variations using space-based methodologies like EM signals, SAR interferometry, GPS for ionospheric sounding, satellite gravimetry, atmospheric sounding, Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR), radon gas and seismo-tectonic clouds. In this paper, the authors have considered surface latent heat flux (SLHF) and OLR satellite data for detailed analysis of earthquakes took place during the year 2014 in Sumatra and Nicobar Is regions. At the surface and atmospheric interface, the anomalous variations in SLHF were observed prior to the occurrence of the earthquake. Similarly, anomalous variations in OLR have been observed 3–30 days prior to the big earthquakes and it is measured above the cloud level. From the analysis, the author has found that variations in the SLHF and OLR flux can be utilized as efficient tools to identify the impending big earthquakes. SLHF and OLR variation level can give us a clue about the probable magnitude of earthquakes and also about earthquake preparation zones. Hence, by correlating the above-mentioned parameters, it is potential to key out the impending earthquakes with reasonable accuracy. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.},

With the rapid increase in the chemical libraries, virtual screening process becomes computationally challenging, thereby posing a demand for efficiently parallelized software pipelines. Here we present a GNU Parallel based pipeline-POAP that is programmed to run Open Babel and AutoDock suite under highly optimized parallelization. The ligand preparation module is a unique feature in POAP, as it offers extensive options for geometry optimization, conformer generation, parallelization and also quarantines erroneous datasets for seamless operation. POAP also features multi receptor docking that can be utilized for comparative virtual screening and drug repurposing studies.

abstract={A complex collective emerging behavior characterized by coexisting coherent and incoherent domains is termed as a chimera state. We bring out the existence of a new type of chimera in a nonlocally coupled ensemble of identical oscillators driven by a common dynamic environment. The latter facilitates the onset of phase-flip bifurcation/transitions among the coupled oscillators of the ensemble, while the nonlocal coupling induces a partial asynchronization among the out-of-phase synchronized oscillators at this onset. This leads to the manifestation of coexisting out-of-phase synchronized coherent domains interspersed by asynchronous incoherent domains elucidating the existence of a different type of chimera state. In addition to this, a rich variety of other collective behaviors such as clusters with phase-flip transition, conventional chimera, solitary state and complete synchronized state which have been reported using different coupling architectures are found to be induced by the employed couplings for appropriate coupling strengths. The robustness of the resulting dynamics is demonstrated in ensembles of two paradigmatic models, namely Rössler oscillators and Stuart-Landau oscillators. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The development of internet technologies has brought digital services to the hands of common man. In the selection process of relevant digital services to the active target user, recommender systems have proved its efficiency as a successful decision support tool. Among many successful techniques incorporated to generate recommendations, collaborative filtering has been widely used to make similarity-based predictions for the recommendation of the relevant list of items to the users. As an advancement, utilizing clustering mechanisms with collaborative filtering for grouping similar users as clusters can enhance the efficiency of the recommendation generated. Though many clustering mechanisms have been employed to group similar users in the existing works, incorporation of bio-inspired clustering has yet to be explored for the generation of optimal recommendations. In this paper, a novel user clustering approach based on Quantum-behaved Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO) has been proposed for the collaborative filtering based recommender system. The proposed recommendation approach has been evaluated on real-world large-scale datasets of Yelp and TripAdvisor for hit-rate, precision, recall, f-measure, and accuracy. The obtained results illustrate the advantageous performance of proposed approach over its peer works of recent times. We have also developed a new mobile recommendation framework XplorerVU for the urban trip recommendation in smart cities, to evaluate the proposed recommendation approach and the real-time implementation details of the mobile application in the smart-cities are also presented. The evaluation results prove the usefulness of the generated recommendations and depict the users’ satisfaction on the proposed recommendation approach. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Studies on the association of cytochrome p450 A1 (m1, m2), catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) H108L, glutathione S-transferase (GST) T1 and M1 polymorphisms with breast cancer risk were inconclusive. The current study was aimed to clarify the ambiguity in genetic associations of these enzymes with breast cancer risk on a global perspective. A systematic literature search was carried out in PubMed, Google Scholar and Medline, covering all the case–control studies published until September 2017. A meta-analysis was performed based on the random-effect and fixed-effect models to calculate the overall association of each genetic variant with breast cancer risk. Of the five polymorphisms studied, GSTT1 (OR: 1.07, 95% CI: 1.02–1.12 and OR: 1.08, 95% CI: 1.01–1.15 for fixed-effect and random-effect models, respectively) and GSTM1 (OR: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.17–1.26 and OR: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.12–1.35 for fixed-effect and random-effect models, respectively) null polymorphisms exhibited an increased risk for breast cancer in both the models.

abstract={Purpose: NDP-related retinopathies are a group of X-linked disorders characterized by degenerative and proliferative changes of the neuroretina, occasionally accompanied with varying degrees of mental retardation and sensorineural hearing loss. NDP is the predominant gene associated with NDP-related retinopathies. The purpose of this study was to report the clinical and genetic findings in three unrelated patients diagnosed with NDP-related retinopathies. Methods: The patients underwent complete ophthalmic examination followed by genetic analyses. NDP gene was screened by direct sequencing approach. Targeted resequencing of several other ocular genes was carried out in patient samples that either indicated NDP gene deletion or tested negative for NDP mutation. Gene quantitation analysis was performed using real-time PCR. Results: The whole NDP gene was deleted in patient I, while a missense NDP mutation, c.205T>C, was identified in patient II, and both had classical Norrie disease ocular phenotype (with no other systemic defects). Patient III who was diagnosed with familial exudative vitreoretinopathy did not show any mutation in the known candidate genes as well as in other ocular genes tested. Conclusions: The patient with whole NDP gene deletion did not exhibit any apparent extraocular defects (like mental retardation or sensorineural hearing loss) during his first decade of life, and this is considered to be a notable finding. Our study also provides evidence emphasizing the need for genetic testing which could eliminate ambiguities in clinical diagnosis and detect carrier status, thereby aiding the patient and family members during genetic counseling. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={The geometric structure, electronic and adsorption properties of methanol, ethanol and 1-propanol molecules on hydrogenated graphene (graphane) were investigated using first-principles calculations. The stability of graphane base material is confirmed using formation energy and phonon band structures. The adsorption of alcohol molecules on bare graphane and hydrogen vacant graphane nanosheet is found to be prominent and the selectivity of alcohol molecules can be achieved using bare or hydrogen vacant graphane nanosheet. Moreover, the interaction of alcohol molecules on bare and hydrogen vacant graphane nanosheets is studied using the adsorption energy, energy band gap variation, Bader charge transfer and average energy band gap variation. The adsorption energy ranges from -0.149 to −0.383 eV upon alcohol adsorption. The energy gap varies from 4.71 to 2.62 eV for bare graphane and from 4.02 to 3.60 eV for hydrogen vacant graphane nanosheets upon adsorption of alcohol molecules. The adsorption properties of alcohol molecules provide useful information for the possible application of graphane nanosheet as a base material for the detection of alcohol molecules. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={With the alarming increase in the antibiotic resistance, there is an immediate need for alternative therapeutic strategies to combat this ever-changing bacterial battle. Combinatorial therapies have gained attention owing to their multiple targeted actions. The use of antibiotic is inevitable and antibiotics in combinations have been in use to treat drug resistant infections. Nevertheless, the multidrug resistant strains have found their own mechanisms to surpass such combinatorial treatments. Quorum sensing (QS) inhibition is considered to be the silver lining but is yet to find its way to commercial use. Hence, to combat the antibiotic resistance crisis, the synergy of QSIs and antibiotics is one of the possible revolutionary approaches. In this chapter, we have highlighted the importance and need for the synergy approach with the successful in vitro and in vivo studies that can possibly be extended to the commercial use. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.

abstract={Identifying the spoken language from the speech is the emerging research area. For this task of language identification, experiments are implemented with two approaches such as Vector quantization (VQ) based clustering and Gaussian mixture modelling (GMM) with Mel frequency linear predictive cepstrum (MFPLPC), Mel frequency cepstrum (MFCC) and their shifted delta cepstral (SDC) features. Hypothesized language is identified based on minimum of averages and maximum log likelihood value corresponding to the model using minimum distance and Maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) classifiers. Better performance is observed for the basic feature MFPLP and VQ based clustering. The results are projected to indicate that the combined MFCC feature with its SDC component with size 52 has provided the better results using GMM as a modeling technique. Similarly, the combined MFPLP feature with its SDC component of size 52 provides next higher results as compared to the basic MFPLP feature of size 13 using clustering as a modeling technique. Overall performance of the system obtained is 99.81%.

abstract={In recent times, Recommender Systems (RSs) are gaining immense popularity with the wider adaptation to deal information overload problem in various application domains such as e-commerce, entertainment, e-tourism, etc. RSs are developed as information filtering systems to make personalized predictions based on the priorities and preferences for the suggestion of relevant items to users. Travel Recommender Systems (TRSs) generates a list of best matching locations or Point of Interests (POIs) to the users based their preferences. Predicting interesting locations for the generation recommendations from Location Based Social Network (LBSN) is crucial due to variety, size, and dimensions of data. The growing demand for effective TRS extends the scope for the development of user behavior based recommendation approach. In the literature, several research works are conducted to generate location recommendations by focusing on location attributes and failed to incorporate user behavior. As a significant solution to the existing limitations of TRSs, we propose Activity and Behavior induced Personalized Recommender System (ABiPRS) as a hybrid approach to predict persuasive POI recommendations. The proposed ABiPRS is designed to support travelling user by providing effective list of POIs as recommendations. As an extension, we have designed a new group recommendation model to meet the requirements of the group of users by exploiting relationships between them. Further, we have developed a novel hybridization approach for aggregating recommendations from multiple RSs to improve the effectiveness of recommendations. The proposed approaches are evaluated on the real-time large-scale datasets of Yelp and TripAdvisor. The experimental results depict the improved performance of the proposed hybrid recommendation approach over standalone and baseline hybrid approaches. © 2018 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature},

abstract={We demonstrate an efficient approach for quantifying frictional forces (sub-piconewton) at nano-bio interfaces by controlled magnetic forces, which is based on simultaneous measurements of critical frequencies for streptavidin-coupled magnetic particles. The maximum phase angle, being corresponded with the critical frequency, is formulated in terms of magnetic, frictional, and viscous forces of the particles on DNA- and SiO2-functionalized micromagnet arrays. The streptavidin/DNA interface shows lower friction as an enhanced lubrication than the streptavidin/SiO2 interface, which is indicated by the lower transition field of quasi-static motion, the larger ratio of dynamic particles, and also the higher velocity of the particles. The friction coefficients at the streptavidin/DNA and streptavidin/SiO2 interfaces are evaluated numerically as 0.07 and 0.11, respectively, regardless of the vertical force and the velocity. The proposed method would open up new possibilities to study mechanical interactions at biological surfaces. © 2018 American Chemical Society.},

With increasing concerns over climate change and the concepts of sustainability, the need for renewable energy sources that also promise higher incentives for customers become vital. This research work determines the profitability of residential on-grid solar systems in India by conducting a cost benefit analysis using Net present value (NPV) and Payback Period (PBP) as the primary indicators. The impacts of Maintenance costs, Net metering incentives (NMI) and Subsidies on NPV and PBP are studied later in this paper. Annual income generation using feed-in-tariffs (FiT's) have also been discussed. Conclusions along with Policy recommendations for improving profitability thereby making on-grid residential solar energy more lucrative have been put up in the last sections of this research paper. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={In this micromagnetic framework, Spin transfer torque induced magnetization switching in Co/Cu/Co nanopillar device is investigated numerically. The magnetization switching dynamics of the free layer in the nanopillar device is governed by the Landau Lifshitz Gilbert Slonczewski (LLGS) equation and solving it numerically by employing OOMMF, a micromagnetic software. Results are obtained by varying the fixed layer orientation (β) of our nanopillar device from in-plane to out-of-plane (i.e.) from 0°to 80°and the corresponding switching time is noted. Results of the micromagnetic simulation reveals that there is an extreme reduction of switching time in the free layer of our devised nanopillar, if we increase the fixed layer angle (β) from 0°to 80°. The corresponding switching time got shortened from 1651 picoseconds to 104.44 picoseconds and is obtained for an applied current density of 2.25×1011Am-2 with 0.05 T as applied bias field. For 90°(i.e.) out-of-plane orientation, the magnetization switching is not exist, because the free layer magnetization follows an oscillation state. Moreover, when we compare 0°to 80°, the switching time is reduced almost 16 times which solely provoked as a source of future spintronic devices for magnetic storage applications. © 2018 Author(s).},

abstract={Spin waves in ID periodic triangular array of antidots are encarved in a permalloy magnonic waveguide is investigated through micromagnetic simulation. The effect of the rotating array of antidots and in-plane rotation of the scattering centers on the band structure are investigated, to indicate new possibilities of fine tuning of spin-wave filter pass and stop bands. The results show that, the opening and closing of band gaps paves a way for band pass and stop filters on waveguide. From the results, the scattering center and strong spatial distribution field plays crucible role for controlling opening and closing bandgap width of ∼12 GHz for 0°rotation. We have obtained a single narrow bandgap of width 1GHz is obtained for 90°rotation of the antidot. Similarly, the tunability is achieved for desired microwave applications done by rotating triangular antidots with different orientation. © 2018 Author(s).},

abstract={The online telemedicine systems are helpful since they provide timely and effective healthcare services. Such online healthcare systems are usually based on sophisticated and advanced wearable and wireless sensor technologies. A rapid technological growth has improved the scope of many remote health monitoring systems. Here, the researchers employed a cloud-based remote monitoring system for observing the health status of the patients after monitoring their heart rate variability. This system was developed after considering many factors like the ease of application, costs, accuracy, and the data security. Furthermore, this system was also conceptualized to act as an interface between the patients and the healthcare providers, thus ensuring a two-way communication between them. The major aim of this paper was to provide the best healthcare monitoring services to the people living in the remote areas, which was otherwise very difficult owing to the small doctor-to-patient ratio. The researchers also analyzed their monitoring system using two different databases. First comes from MIT Physionet database i.e., the MIT-BIH sinus rhythm and the MIT-St. Petersburg. While the second database was collected after monitoring 30 people who were asked to use these wearable sensors. After analyzing the performance of the proposed scheme, the obtained results for accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were 99.02%, 98.78%, and 99.17%, respectively. The achieved results concluded that the proposed system was quite reliable, robust, and valuable. Also, the data analysis revealed that this system was very convenient and ensured data security. In addition, this developed monitoring system generated warning messages, directed towards the patients and the doctors, during some critical situation. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Different nano-structures of noble metals have been the conventional substrates for carrying out Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS). In this paper we examine electrodeposited copper (Cu) nano-structures on pencil graphite as novel substrate to carry out SERS measurements by considering L-cystine (Cys-Cys) (dimer of the amino acid cysteine) as the probe. The formation of monolayer of the probe molecule on the substrates was confirmed using cyclic voltammetric measurements. Mode of adsorption of Cys-Cys was observed to be different on bulk Cu (taken in the wire form) and nano-structured Cu on pencil graphite. Whereas in the former the disulphide bond of Cys-Cys remained intact, it got cleaved when Cys-Cys was adsorbed on electrodeposited copper indicating the activated nature of the nano-structure compared to bulk copper. C–S stretching mode of vibration underwent blue shift in Cys-Cys adsorbed on Cu on pencil graphite vis-à-vis Cys-Cys adsorbed on Cu wire. Further evidence on the cleavage of the C–S bond on an activated substrate was obtained by considering a bimetallic substrate comprising of silver on copper which was electrodeposited on pencil graphite. Our studies have demonstrated that nano‑copper surface is an excellent substrate for SERS giving 200 μM as lower detection limit for Cys-Cys. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={A detailed structural analysis of two adamantane derivatives namely, ethyl 2-[(Z)-1-(adamantan-1-yl)-3-(phenyl)isothioureido]acetate I and ethyl 2-[(Z)-1-(adamantan-1-yl)-3-(4-fluorophenyl)isothioureido]acetate II is carried out to understand the effect of fluorine substitution. The introduction of fluorine atom alters the crystal packing and is completely different from its parent compound. The fluorine substitution drastically reduced the intermolecular H⋯H contacts and this reduction is compensated by intermolecular F⋯H and F⋯F contacts. The relative contributions of various intermolecular contacts present in these structures were quantified using Hirshfeld surface analysis. Energetically significant molecular pairs were identified from the crystal structures of these compounds using PIXEL method. The structures of I and II are optimized in gas and solvent phases using the B3LYP-D3/6-311++G(d,p) level of theory. The quantum theory of atoms-in-molecules (QTAIM) analysis was carried out to estimate the strengths of various intermolecular contacts present in these molecular dimers. The results suggest that the H–H bonding take part in the stabilization of crystal structures. The experimental and theoretical UV–Vis results show the variations in HOMO and LUMO energy levels. In silico docking analysis indicates that both compounds I and II may exhibit inhibitory activity against 11-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (11-β-HSD1). © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Thermal barrier coated diesel engine, also known as low heat rejection (LHR) engine have offered the promise of reducing heat rejection to the engine coolant and increase the combustion temperature which results in increase of thermal efficiency, decrease of fuel consumption and emission rate of the engine. Biodiesel derived from the vegetable oils are a promising alternative fuel for diesel fuel. The viscosity of vegetable oil after transestrification is still higher than that of diesel fuel. The various researchers have reported that the energy of the biodiesel could be released more efficiently with the concept of LHR engine. In the case of LHR engine running on different biodiesel blends, almost all experimental studies has predicted improved performance.

abstract={The indices of power quality of the Multiple Output Switched Mode Power Supply (MOSMPS) implemented in personal computers are unacceptable by the power quality standards. The Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) of the source current is higher than 75%, the Power Factor (PF) at the input side is lesser than 0.6 and the voltage regulation at the output side is also poor thereby making the performance of the MOSMPS inefficient. The conventional MOSMPS does not meet the IEEE standard of Power Quality (PQ). In this paper, a zeta converter based Power Factor Correction (PFC) is proposed and implemented at the front end to improve the performance of SMPS and the PQ indices. The advantage of the proposed converter is that it mitigates the 100 Hz ripples at the output side of the converter which is fed as an input to the second stage converter. The best performance and efficiency of the proposed zeta converter is determined by analyzing the converter under three different modes of operation. The proposed Neural Network (NN) controlled zeta converter is modeled, designed and simulated using MATLAB Simulink software. The simulation results prove that %THD and PF at the input side meet the IEEE standard of power quality under fluctuating conditions. © 2006-2018 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).},

SSA is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm which mimics the navigating and hunting behavior of salp. The hybrid SSA is applied to optimize the circuit design parameters and to minimize the MOS transistor sizes. The proposed swarm intelligence approach was successfully implemented for an automatic design and optimization of CMOS analog ICs using Generic Process Design Kit (GPDK) 180 nm technology. The circuit design parameters and design specifications are validated through a simulation program for integrated circuit emphasis simulator. To investigate the efficiency of the proposed approach, comparisons have been carried out with other simulation-based circuit design methods.

abstract={Using ab initio technique, electronic properties including structural stability of the chair-like graphane nanosheet (HGr-NS) and nanotube (HGr-NT) is explored. The structural stability of graphane nanosheet/nanotube is confirmed with the influence of formation energy and phonon band structure. The density-of-states spectrum provides the insights on charge transfer upon these small molecules adsorbed on graphane material. The energy band gap of graphane base material get differs when toxic gas molecules (NO2 and SO2) interacted with HGr-NS and HGr-NT. The adsorption energy upon interaction of NO2 and SO2 molecules on graphane material is found to be in the range of −0.5 and −0.3 eV, respectively. Further, the average energy gap variation of graphane system is noticed to be in the range of 34.67 to 55.95% for NO2 adsorbed graphane and 87.3 to 151.45% for SO2 adsorption on graphane sheets. Notably, a shorter recovery time is obtained on graphane sensor upon desorption of SO2 molecules. Besides, the interaction of SO2 small molecule on hydrogenated graphene nanosheet and nanotube is found to be more favorable rather than NO2 molecules. The findings propose the application of HGr-NS and HGr-NT for the detection of NO2 and SO2 small molecules. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

This paper presents VM NeAR (VM Nearest and Available to Residual resource ratios of PM), a novel heuristic method to address the above said challenges in VBP. Further, we have developed Bulk-Bin-Packing based VM Placement (BBPVP) and Multi-Capacity Bulk VM Placement (MCBVP) as a solution for VBP. The simulation results on real-time Amazon EC2 dataset and synthetic datasets obtained from CISH, SASTRA shows that VM NeAR based MCVBP achieves about 1.6% reduction in the number of PMs and possess a packing speed which was found to be 24 times faster than exisiting state-of-the-art VBP heuristics. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={We report the adsorption properties of methanol (ML) and ethanol (EL) vapor molecules on to the monolayer MoSe2 surface. Before, studying the adsorption behavior, the structural stability of MoSe2 monolayer is ensured with formation energy. The stable monolayer MoSe2 nanosheet is used as a base material for the adsorption of ML and EL vapor molecules. The interaction of ML and EL vapors on MoSe2 surface layer is explored using the adsorption energy, energy gap variation and Bader charge analysis. We noticed the band gap variation between 1.43 and 1.88 eV upon adsorption of methanol and ethanol vapors on to MoSe2 nanosheets. Also the adsorption energy is found in the range of −0.375 to −0.732 eV upon the interaction of alcohol molecules on MoSe2 flakes. Besides, the density of states (DOS) spectrum and electron density clearly envisions the adsorption properties of ML and EL vapors on to the MoSe2 monolayers. Furthermore, a short recovery time is noticed for MoSe2 nanosheet material upon desorption of methanol and ethanol molecules. Moreover, the variation in the resistance of MoSe2 base material is noticed upon adsorption of ML and EL molecules. The findings show that monolayer MoSe2 nanosheets can be used as a chemi-resistance to detect the presence of ML and EL vapors in the environment. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={This study aims to cast light on the nature of interactions and cooperativity that exists in linear dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) clusters using dispersion corrected density functional theory. In the linear DMSO, DMSO molecules in the middle of the clusters are bound strongly than at the terminal. The plot of the total binding energy of the clusters vs the cluster size and mean polarizabilities vs cluster size shows an excellent linearity demonstrating the presence of cooperativity effect. The computed incremental binding energy of the clusters remains nearly constant, implying that DMSO addition at the terminal site can happen to form an infinite chain. In the linear clusters, two σ-hole at the terminal DMSO molecules were found and the value on it was found to increase with the increase in cluster size. The quantum theory of atoms in molecules topography shows the existence of hydrogen and S[dbnd]O⋯S type in linear tetramer and larger clusters. In the dimer and trimer S[dbnd]O⋯O[dbnd]S type of interaction exists. In 2D non-covalent interactions plot, additional peaks in the regions which contribute to the stabilization of the clusters were observed and it splits in the trimer and intensifies in the larger clusters. In the trimer and larger clusters in addition to the blue patches due to hydrogen bonds, additional, light blue patches were seen between the hydrogen atom of the methyl groups and the sulphur atom of the nearby DMSO molecule. Thus, in addition to the strong H-bonds, strong electrostatic interactions between the sulphur atom and methyl hydrogens exists in the linear clusters. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Abstract: The structural stability of borophene nanosheet and nanotubes, including electronic properties was explored using the density-functional-theory technique. Moreover, the stability of isolated pristine borophene nanosheet and nanotube is substantiated with the help of formation energy. The energy band gap of pristine borophene material is found to be semi-metallic. The interaction of NH3 molecules on borophene material is analyzed using Bader charge transfer, adsorption energy, density-of-states spectrum, energy band gap and percentage of average-energy-gap variation. The interaction of hazardous NH3 gas molecules on borophene nanosheet and nanotubes is studied at an atomistic level. The interaction of nitrogen atom in ammonia molecules on borophene material is observed to be the prominent adsorption site. The findings suggest that borophene nanosheets as well as nanotubes can be used as a chemi-resistor for the detection of ammonia molecules present in the atmosphere.

In this context, to achieve high sensitivity and superior key space, a multiple chaotic map based image encryption algorithm has been proposed. The proposed algorithm employs three-stage permutation and diffusion to withstand several attacks and the same is modelled in reconfigurable platform namely Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The comprehensive analysis is done with various parameters to exhibit the robustness of the proposed algorithm and its ability to withstand brute-force, differential and statistical attacks. The synthesized result demonstrates that the reconfigurable hardware architecture takes approximately 0.098 ms for encrypting an image of size 256 × 256.

abstract={Textual information is often added to spatial objects, and thus a spatial search query includes both location-based and textual-based information. For example, a user may want to visit a dental hospital with orthodontic appliances and dental lasers, before going to a pharmacy to buy some drugs (ibuprofen and tylenol). Currently, a brute force technique combined with a spatial inverted index is used to find an optimal set of spatial objects that satisfy both location and textual constraints. In this study, we identify some problems with the brute force technique and propose two algorithms that recommend an optimal shortest path among heterogeneous objects. Our method outputs the shortest path from the user point to all the heterogeneous objects. Results obtained using our algorithm demonstrated that it produces the optimal shortest path compared with existing spatial-textual search algorithms. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The quality of chemically synthesized few-layered graphene, which is known as reduced graphene oxide (RGO) depends on the oxidation of graphite, effective exfoliation of graphite oxide and complete reduction of graphene oxide. Herein, we report the preparation of nitrogen doped RGO by a modified Hummer’s method using potassium manganate along with potassium permanganate to achieve improved oxidation of graphite and a small amount of bovine serum albumin as a dispersant to avoid restacking of graphene sheets. Besides reducing the agglomeration of graphene layers, bovine serum albumin also serves as a nitrogen dopant. The quality of as-prepared nitrogen doped RGO is examined by morphological and structural studies. While microscopic studies confirm the formation of thin, well dispersed RGO sheets, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic studies confirm the doping of nitrogen in RGO. A specific surface area of 286 m2 g−1 is obtained for nitrogen doped RGO, which is mainly contributed by the basal planes and ordered mesoporosity of RGO. The capacitance properties of as-prepared nitrogen doped RGO without any conductive additive are evaluated by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge–discharge cycling. A specific capacitance of 142 F g−1 obtained at a current density 1 A g−1 is almost twice the specific capacitance obtained for commercial graphene platelet aggregates (75 F g−1). The rate performance of as-prepared nitrogen doped RGO is comparable to that of commercial graphene platelet aggregates. It is also found that nitrogen doped RGO electrode can be charged and discharged for at least 2000 cycles without fade in the capacitance. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Bone tissue engineering (BTE) relies on biocomposite scaffolds and bioactive molecules for bone regeneration. The present study was aimed to synthesize and characterize biocomposite scaffolds containing chitosan (CS), nano-hydroxyapatite (nHAp) and nano‑zirconium dioxide (nZrO2) along with microRNA (miRNA) for BTE applications. miRNAs act as post-transcriptional regulator of gene expression. The fabricated biocomposite scaffolds were characterized using SEM, FT-IR and XRD analyses. The effect of a bioactive molecule (miR-590-5p) with scaffolds was tested for osteoblast differentiation at the cellular and molecular levels using mouse mesenchymal stem cells (C3H10T1/2). The results showed that CS/nHAp/nZrO2 scaffolds promoted osteoblast differentiation, and this effect was further increased in the presence of miR-590-5p in C3H10T1/2 cells. Thus, we suggested that CS/nHAp/nZrO2 scaffolds with miR-590-5p would have potential towards the treatment of bone defects. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Progress in the development of phytochemistry has delivered advancement in materials functionality for range of inter/trans-disciplinary application. Here, we investigated the structural functionality of chemically synthesized phytoconstitutent, chalcone (butein) and flavanone (butin). Photoactive and electroactive behavior of butein and butin were comprehensively studied using UV–vis absorbance, photoluminescence and cyclic voltammetric techniques. Surface morphology of the butein and butin powders was characterized from scanning electron microscope at an operating voltage of 10 kV. Significant ultraviolet absorbance property are observed from butein and butin due to the distribution of π → π* and n → π* transitions. Photoluminescence emission spectra of the prepared materials are well resolved at visible region via keto-enol tautomerization and can be influenced by solvent pH. Cyclic voltammetric studies on the prepared materials enabled a direct electron-transfer reaction at gold-screen printed electrode, indicating the feasibility for analytical validation in herbal industries. Existence of multiple electroactive hydroxyl groups makes butein and butin a redox-functional species at electrode interface. Dispersion ability in aqueous and organic solvents makes butein and butin suitable for variety of photochemical applications. This phytochemical material offers new degrees of optical and redox functionality similar to inorganic nanostructures, in addition to inherent bioactivity, that may be advantageous for further biomedical function. © 2018},

abstract={High penetration of wind power generation system into grid network has satisfied enormous energy demand and has necessitated the wind power generation system to remain connected with grid network to maintain essential grid stability, even during grid fault conditions. This paper presents a novel hybrid genetic algorithm optimized Elman neural network controller for proton exchange membrane fuel cell supported customized Dynamic Voltage Restorer (DVR) to improve the fault ride-through capability of Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) based wind power generation systems. The outstanding aspect of the proposed customized DVR is that it has low heat transmission losses, therefore has a better efficiency up to 3% when compared with the conventional energy storage based DVR. The proposed shrewd DVR adequately rides through the fault by improving voltage regulation and prevents wind turbine termination during grid faults. The effectiveness of the customized DVR and proposed control strategy is analyzed for doubly fed induction generator based wind power generation system under symmetrical and unsymmetrical fault conditions. The operation of customized DVR is confirmed using time-domain simulation study carried out in MATLAB/Simulink environment. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Neodymium doped tin oxide (Nd: SnO2) thin films were deposited on heated glass substrates with different Nd concentrations (0, 2, 4 and 6 %) by nebulizer spray pyrolysis method. Effects of Nd doping on structural, optical and electrical properties of the prepared ﬁlms were investigated. X-ray diffraction study confirmed that all the deposited Nd: SnO2 films are in polycrystalline tetragonal structure with (211) preferential orientation. FESEM images showed that the prepared SnO2 particles are in nano-size in spherical shape, completely covering the substrate. AFM topology showed smooth deposition of the films with minimum surface roughness. The films showed maximum optical transmittance 90 % in the visible region with a band gap value 3.67 eV, also showed low refractive index and extinction coefficients. Room temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectrum exhibited a strong UV emission peak at 356 nm for all the films. All the Nd: SnO2 films displayed n-type conductivity with low electrical resistivity 5.88 × 10−4 (Ω cm) for 4 % Nd doping. As the films showed good ﬁgure of merit (ϕ) values, these Nd doped SnO2 thin films can perform better role in optoelectronic device. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Early growth response-1 (Egr-1) protein upregulation is reported in diabetes and vascular disorders. This study aims at deciphering its role in hyperglycemia induced changes of retinal endothelium. Human retinal endothelial cells (hRECs) were exposed to hyperglycemia (25 mM) and normoglycemia (5.5 mM). Gene silencing was done using siRNA against Egr-1. Transcript and protein level analysis of Egr-1 and gene targets were done using qPCR and immunoblotting respectively in hRECs, diabetic and nondiabetic human retina and immunofluorescence for localization in retinal sections. Hyperglycemia induced Egr-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) but not pigment epithelium derived factor (PEDF) in hRECs. Expression of Egr-1 repressor NGFI-A binding protein-2 (NAB-2) was unaltered. Egr-1 downstream gene targets, tissue factor (TF) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression were increased in hRECs which was reduced by Egr-1 silencing in hyperglycemia. Diabetic retina, showed an increase in Egr-1, VEGF-A and gene target TF, ICAM-1 but not NAB-2 and PEDF similar to the changes seen in hyperglycemic hRECs. Hyperglycemic induction of Egr-1 and absence of NAB-2 repression in retinal endothelium, up-regulates downstream genes involved in pro-thrombotic and pro-inflammatory pathways linking Egr-1 in diabetes mediated vascular aberration of retina. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS) is a retinal degenerative disorder caused by mutations in RS1 gene leading to splitting of retinal layers (schisis) which impairs visual signal processing. Retinoschisin (RS1) is an adhesive protein which is secreted predominantly by the photoreceptors and bipolar cells as a double-octameric complex. In general, XLRS patients show wide clinical heterogeneity, presenting practical challenges in disease management. Though researchers have attempted various approaches to offer an explanation for clinical heterogeneity, the molecular basis has not been understood yet. Therefore, this study aims at establishing a link between the phenotype and genotype based on the molecular mechanism exerted by the mutations. Twenty seven XLRS patients were enrolled, of which seven harboured novel mutations. The mutant constructs were genetically engineered and their secretion profiles were studied by in vitro cell culture experiments. Based on the secretory profile, the patients were categorized as either secreted or non-secreted group. Various clinical parameters such as visual acuity, location of schisis, foveal thickness and ERG parameters were compared between the two groups and control. Although the two groups showed severe disease phenotype in comparison with control, there was no significant difference between the two XLRS groups. However, the secreted group exhibited relatively severe disease indications. On the other hand molecular analysis suggests that most of the RS1 mutations result in intracellular retention of retinoschisin. Hence, clinical parameters of patients with non-secreted profile were analyzed which in turn revealed wide variability even within the group. Altogether, our results indicate that disease severity is not merely dependent on secretory profile of the mutations. Thus, we hypothesize that intricate molecular detail such as the precise localization of mutant protein in the cell as well as its ability to assemble into a functionally active oligomer might largely influence disease severity among XLRS patients. © 2018 Sudha et al.

abstract={Fibrosis is a prevalent pathological condition arising from the chronic activation of fibroblasts. This activation results from the extensive intercellular crosstalk mediated by both soluble factors and direct cell-cell connections. Prominent among these are the interactions of fibroblasts with immune cells, in which the fibroblast-mast cell connection, although acknowledged, is relatively unexplored. We have used a Tg mouse model of skin fibrosis, based on expression of the transcription factor Snail in the epidermis, to probe the mechanisms regulating mast cell activity and the contribution of these cells to this pathology. We have discovered that Snail-expressing keratinocytes secrete plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI1), which functions as a chemotactic factor to increase mast cell infiltration into the skin. Moreover, we have determined that PAI1 upregulates intercellular adhesion molecule type 1 (ICAM1) expression on dermal fibroblasts, rendering them competent to bind to mast cells. This heterotypic cell-cell adhesion, also observed in the skin fibrotic disorder scleroderma, culminates in the reciprocal activation of both mast cells and fibroblasts, leading to the cascade of events that promote fibrogenesis. Thus, we have identified roles for PAI1 in the multifactorial program of fibrogenesis that expand its functional repertoire beyond its canonical role in plasmin-dependent processes. © 2018 Academic Press.

The mathematical models of machining time, surface roughness, hole diameter were expressed a function of the input parameters cutting speed and feed. Cuckoo Search is carried out so as to retrieve the ideal set of drilling parameters to have a minimal machining time in order to get the desired surface finish and hole tolerance.

abstract={In the present work, an attempt is made to reduce scavenging problems by developing a new model of two-stroke spark-ignition engine. This model allows the flow of fresh air through intake valves positioned at the bottom of the cylinder and exit of burnt gases through exhaust ports situated at the top of the cylinder. The exhaust ports are closed by the piston as it moves towards the bottom of the cylinder following which gasoline is injected minimizing the possibility of mixing of fuel with outgoing exhaust gases. During the expansion, the piston unravels the exhaust ports and the burnt gases escape to the atmosphere due to pressure difference. Due to low density at high temperatures, the exhaust gases naturally rise against gravity, reducing the possibility of mixing with incoming fresh air. Further, the investigation on fuel distribution inside the cylinder showed a better distribution during injection against gravity, which promotes cleaner combustion. The combustion analysis was done using Diesel-RK software and flow analysis was done using ANSYS FLUENT. © TJPRC Pvt. Ltd.},

Various programming methods in manufacturing of threads were studied in this research work. The cycle times of three different work piece materials during the G76 threading cycle were noted. Then, we proposed G92 cycle of threading to reduce the cycle time. The new process enabled variable depth of cut, less number of passes resulting in cycle time and it is easy to use. The work was practically implemented on a CNC lathe machine and the data related to the experiments were recorded. This method was applied to 10 other work pieces, wherein it was noted that for all types of threads manufactured, a considerable amount of time is being saved and the productivity was increased marginally. © TJPRC Pvt.

abstract={Vertical Roller Mill (VRM) has been promptly employed and extensively used for clinker and cement grinding for past 35 years, because of its higher efficiency and low power consumption. VRM is a highly nonlinear, time delay and composite industrial process with several process loops having a robust coupling between them. Time series data is collected from a real time cement plant with grinding capacity of 170-300 tph for system identification purpose. The collected industrial data is normalized and preprocessed using a moving average window filter to remove odd samples; trends and means are removed for outlier elimination and missing values, then the data is divided into an estimation data and a validation data. In this paper linear and nonlinear system identification methods are applied to identify the VRM model. Finally, this paper proposes an accurate VRM model for industrial requirement to adopt modern control techniques like Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Adaptive Control (AC) for cement grinding in order to improve its automatic control level. © TJPRC Pvt.

The green compacts were sintered at a temperature of 1050±10ºC in a nitrogen purged muffle furnace for 30minutes. The sintered-hot forge upset alloy steel billets of 0.86, 0.90 and 0.98 relative densities were made to encounter aqueous corrosion attack by keeping the billets in a 250 ml pickling acid solution containing 18%HCL (Hydrochloric acid) for various time periods such as 25, 50 and 75hrs. It has been found that an increase in the density of specimens by hot upsetting results in a decrease in the number of pores present in the alloy steel. Though the plain carbon steel consists of soft ferritic-pearlitic microstructure, the densified specimens are found to be lower corrosive in action due to the formation of refined grain structure. Correlation for the corrosion rate relating density and testing time periods has been evolved and verified with experimental results are found to diminish straightly with lessening in porosity. © TJPRC Pvt.

abstract={Methylglyoxal (MG) is a predominant precursor for advanced glycation end products (AGEs) due to its protein glycation reactions, which are the major causes of diabetic complications.

abstract={Replacement of faulty sensor signals in a cement kiln is a challenging problem in fault diagnosis due to the increasing demand of fault- free feedback signal to the controller in order to produce good quality cement and estimation technique have been widely practiced for this. It is found from the literature that sensor faults in a highly energyintensive process will have a huge impact on the end product quality and profits. Cement industries, particularly the rotary kiln processes are plagued by temperature sensor faults, oxygen analyzer faults and it is a significant engineering research problem to diagnose the fault accurately amidst both random sensor and system disturbances. Fault in these measurements will severely affect the controller performance resulting in poor quality cement. In this work, Kalman filter based residual signal generation and replacement signal generation technique is employed for detecting bias fault and sensor measurement failure in pyrometer, thermocouple, and preheater oxygen analyzer of the kiln process because of the significance of these measurements in determining the quality of the cement. This work is divided into threephase1) Modelling 2) Residual signal generation 3) Replacement signal generation. The subspace method based state space model has been identified for three sensors and the residuals are found by finding the difference between the estimated states from the Kalman filter and the actual states and the deviation in the residuals will be used as a metric to indicate the nature and occurrence of faults, finally replacement signal has been generated for faulty sensors using the prior estimated states with irrespective of the sensor measurement. © TJPRC Pvt.

abstract={Tissue engineering strategies are constantly in search of novel scaffold materials that can accelerate cell adhesion, growth and proliferation. In this context, poly(vinyl formal) (PVF), a biodegradable and water absorbing polymer derived from poly(vinyl alcohol) was explored as a potential scaffold material for neural regeneration. No prior attempts have been made to fabricate electrospun fibrous scaffolds from PVF for tissue engineering applications and this forms the focus of the present study. The electrospinning conditions were optimized to obtain defect-free PVF microfibres with an average diameter of 4.4 ± 0.7 μm. The microfibres exhibited a uniform nanoporous surface and a solid core that augmented neuronal cell adhesion and neurite extension. The fibres were brittle and exhibited a 50% degradation in physiological pH and temperature. The viability of hippocampal neuronal cells cultured on the scaffold showed a progressive increase with time revealing its promise as a scaffold material for neural tissue engineering. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={We theoretically investigated the effect of temperature on the process of modulation instability (MI) in the normal dispersive region of a CS2 core photonic crystal fiber (CSPCF) with delayed nonlinear response (DNR). The study shows that MI sidebands exhibit frequency shift in the normal dispersion region and the onset of such shift of Stokes and the anti-Stokes sidebands is highly dependent on temperature. Also, the temperature influences the bandwidth of Stokes and anti-Stokes sidebands and the same is reflected in the shift of optimum modulation frequency. However, the DNR plays a devastating role on the evolution of MI sidebands and suppress the later completely. With such a dominant behavior of the DNR, temperature does not play a major role except involving in the determination of the critical wavelength for the onset of MI suppression. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Recently, Graphene has attracted a large variety of scientific communities due to its inimitable properties. Typically, Graphene Nanoplatelets (GNPs) are ideal reinforcements for the production of nanocomposites due to its excellent mechanical properties for strength enhancement. This paper reports the Aluminum-Graphene Nanoplatelets (Al/GNPs) composites synthesized through powder metallurgy method. The microstructural investigation was carried out to study the GNPs integration on the Al matrix. For this study, the samples Al-2wt% GNPs, Al-3wt% GNPs and Al- 4wt% GNPs are high-energy ball milled at 200rpm and sintered at 500°C,550°C, and 600°C. Microstructural characterization is carried out with optical microscopy, Scanning electron microscopy. Rockwell hardness test is conducted to evaluate the hardness behavior in Al/GNPs. Microstructural analysis revealed the homogeneous dispersion of GNPs in the Al matrix in all the samples. It is observed that the existence of the graphene nanoparticles and the rise of their concentrations in the aluminum matrix (2 wt.% to 4 wt.%) as reinforcement in addition to rising the sintering temperature (450°C to 600°C) greatly improve the mechanical properties of Al/GNPs composites. © 2018 Author(s).},

abstract={Imaginal progenitors in Drosophila are known to arrest in G2 during larval stages and proliferate thereafter. Here we investigate the mechanism and implications of G2 arrest in progenitors of the adult thoracic tracheal epithelium (tracheoblasts). We report that tracheoblasts pause in G2 for ~48–56 h and grow in size over this period. Surprisingly, tracheoblasts arrested in G2 express drivers of G2-M like Cdc25/String (Stg). We find that mechanisms that prevent G2-M are also in place in this interval. Tracheoblasts activate Checkpoint Kinase 1/Grapes (Chk1/Grp) in an ATR/mei-41-dependent manner. Loss of ATR/Chk1 led to precocious mitotic entry ~24–32 h earlier. These divisions were apparently normal as there was no evidence of increased DNA damage or cell death. However, induction of precocious mitoses impaired growth of tracheoblasts and the tracheae they comprise. We propose that ATR/Chk1 negatively regulate G2-M in developing tracheoblasts and that G2 arrest facilitates cellular and hypertrophic organ growth. © Kizhedathu et al.},

Specific heat of nanoemulsions increased with paraffin wax concentration, with 50% paraffin wax–water nanoemulsion possessing 47% higher specific heat than that of water. The variation of viscosity of paraffin wax–emulsions was similar to that of pure liquid, with a reduction in viscosity at elevated temperatures. The performances of paraffin wax–water emulsions and those of water and pure paraffin wax were evaluated during charging cycle of thermal energy storage in an experimental setup.

abstract={In this study, thermophysical properties: electrical properties, viscosity, refractive index and density of rice bran oil (RBO), RBO added with antioxidants (RBOA), RBOA added with nanoparticle like ZnO and ZnZrO were investigated. Ensuring the quantification of the elements in nanoparticle, morphological study was conducted using SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope). Variation of electrical and rheological properties of base fluid and nanofluid at different temperatures and frequency was investigated. Changes of electrical parameters in the frequency range 1 Hz to 10 MHz of microwave region was experimented. Using Stokes–Einstein equation: diffusion time and diffusion constant were calculated and the enhancement of viscosity was obseved to vary with agglomeration. In addition specific refractive index, specific polarisation and orientation polarisation of the samples were also estimated. Vicissitudes of electrical parameters and viscosity was experimental with temperature ranging from 303 K to 373 K. Shear property of the samples were studied on heating and cooling and the results confirms that shear variation does not affect the stability of nanofluid with temperature. In order to validate the results, modeling has been carried out using Arrhenius and Andrades models for the electrical parameters with temperature and for which the regression coefficient R2 is 0.918 to 1.0. The present study helps to use the nanofluid in the appropriate industrial applications. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={We demonstrate a facile and rapid methodology for preparation of Cu@Pd core-shell nanostructures on a cost-effective pencil graphite substrate. Galvanic replacement reaction was carried out for palladium modification on template electrodeposited copper nanostructures on pencil graphite substrate. The nanostructures are shown to be very stable with excellent electrocatalytic activities. Under optimised conditions, they could be used for histamine sensing at a very low oxidation potential of +0.55 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The low oxidation potential enabled sensitive and selective analysis of histamine using chronoamperometry without any interference from oxygen evolution reactions. We have demonstrated that the sensor shows excellent selectivity towards histamine even in the presence of many of the common interfering biogenic amines. The sensor exhibited a sensitivity of 0.082 μ A/μ M/cm 2 with a limit of detection as low as 3.2 ± 0.1 nM. The oxidation potential and limit of detection obtained using this sensor are much superior to the results reported so far in the literature. Practical feasibility of the developed sensor was manifested by histamine analysis in canned tuna fish samples, where the chronoamperometric estimation was also validated by conventional HPLC analysis. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In this article, we have theoretically devised a Spin Torque Nano Oscillator (STNO) with perpendicular polarizer using macro spin model. The devised spin valve structure is heterogeneous (i.e.) it is made of two different ferromagnetic materials [Co and its alloy CoFeB]. The dynamics of magnetization provoked by spin transfer torque is studied numerically by solving the famous Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski [LLGS] equation. The results are obtained for the perpendicular polarizer and for that particular out of plane orientation we vary the free layer angle from 10° to 90°. The obtained results are highly appealing, because frequency range is available in all the tilt angles of free layer and it is exceptionally tunable in all free layer tilt angles with zero applied field. Moreover, the utmost operating frequency of about 83.3 GHz and its corresponding power of 4.488 μW/mA2/GHz is acquired for the free layer tilt angle θ = 90° with the solid applied current density of 10 × 1010 A/m2. Also, our device emits high quality factor of about 396, which is remarkably desirable for making devices. These pioneering results provides a significant development for future spintronic based devices. © 2018 Author(s).},

abstract={We investigate nonlinear localized magnetic excitations in a simple form of one dimensional magnonic crystal by considering a ferromagnetic medium under periodic applied magnetic field of spatially varying strength. The governing Landau-Lifshitz equation is transformed into nonlinear evolution equation of a complex function through stereographic projection technique. The associated evolution equation numerically solved by using split-step Fourier method (SSFM). From the obtained results it is observed that the excitations appear in the form of solitons and the periodic magnetic field of spatially varying strength perturbs the soliton propagation. Bright and dark soliton solutions are constructed and studied the effect of tuning the strength of spatially periodic applied magnetic field on the nonlinear excitation of magnetization. The results show that the amplitude and velocity of the soliton can be effectively managed by varying the strength of spatially periodic applied magnetic field and it act as periodic potential which provides an additional degree of freedom to control the nature of soliton propagation in a ferromagnetic medium. © 2018 Author(s).},

abstract={In the current study undertaken, aluminum particles of commercial purity grade were compacted using hot ECAP. Investigation of the structural evolution and mechanical properties was done. Measurements of the densities of the samples was done for the purpose of evaluation the performance of the consolidation process. A tensile strength (UTS) of 98 MPa (after first pass) was obtained under tensile loads and the percent elongation to fracture was found to be 5.5%, which indicated good tensile strength and ductility as compared to the commercial pure Al powders consolidated by ambient temperature ECAP and other techniques. The relative density and Rockwell hardness (HRB) of compacts (after first pass) was 99% and 42 respectively. This is indisputable proof for establishing the compatibility of ECAP in the matter of producing bulk materials. Characterization of the material microstructure and fracture behavior was done through use of optical and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The Al powders consolidated at 400°C through ECAP process, exhibited the best combination of yield strength and ductility and hence hot ECAP is suitable method for consolidation of micro powders. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Using the density functional theory (DFT) method, the electronic and mechanical properties of perovskites FeBO3 (B = Ti, Mn, Cr) nanostructures were studied in the pressure range of 0–100 GPa. The band structure studies show the change in the band structure upon substitution of different B cation in FeBO3 perovskite structure. The density of states spectrum gives the perception of change in the electronic properties of FeBO3 with the substitution of B cation. The bulk, shear and Young's moduli were calculated and an increase in the moduli is noticed. Moreover, the hardness increases under high pressure. The high-pressure studies of FeBO3 perovskite nanostructures are explored at atomistic level. The findings show that ductility and hardness of FeBO3 get increased upon an increase in the applied pressure. The substitution of Ti, Mn and Cr on FeBO3 shows a significant change in the electronic and mechanical properties. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={In this modern world society expects more benefits from the "socially-responsible" corporations. Several critics concluded that "Big Pharma" corporations are not running to their societal responsibilities. CSR can be understood as the Socio-economical products of the managerial division of labor concept in the modern world. Worldwide scarcity, shortage and poor health are the primary responsibilities of the world’s national governments and international government associations; it confiscates the authorization of society to proper organizational future conditions. Private companies do not have the societal authorization nor the corporations potential to serve for the poor people or to provide affordable health care facility to the ill in their residence nation and in the budding globe. On the other hand, private companies are providing facilities and responsibilities to the society. CSR is extremely important to augment the financial performance and value of the company. In the pharmaceutical industry, it is not only considering the profitability alone, but also it is focusing on the public and the environment conditions and to create an impact on the society. © RJPT All right reserved.},

abstract={Owing to the environmental impacts of quarrying, there is a developing interest to use alternative materials as coarse aggregate in concrete. Recent advancements were the usage of crushed waste and recycled ceramic materials as a substitute for natural coarse aggregate. Many researchers used the crushed scraps of sanitary wares as a partial replacement of coarse aggregate and reported the strength characteristics of the resulting concrete. This project aims to characterize the concrete with crushed waste wall and floor tiles as a replacement for natural coarse aggregate. The waste tile aggregate was crushed and graded to have the same size of natural coarse aggregate. The study was done by replacing 0%, 50% and 100% of natural coarse aggregate with waste tile aggregates. The reduction in strength of concrete due to the inferior characteristics of tile aggregate was overcame by adopting a blended cementing medium with Flyash and Alccofine as supplementary cementitious materials. The blended cement was tested for the compressive strength at the maturity. The strength characteristics of the resulting concretes were observed and reported. © IAEME Publication.},

The Fractional order PID controller has the non-integer order of integration and differentiation operant that made the controller more robust. For evaluating the performance, the FOPID controller is compared with traditional PID controller. The parameters of both the controllers were optimized by minimizing the objective function using evolutionary algorithms such as Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). An objective function is defined by Integral Time Absolute Error (ITAE). From the entire simulation results it is observed that PSO based FOPID performs well when compared with PID controller. © 2006-2018 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).},

The aim of this work is to design and investigate the predictive controller for controlling the level of tanks in a quadruple tank process based on constrained and unconstrained type of problems. Various disturbance scenarios were also applied and proved by controller to show a good response to disturbance rejection. The best possible control is achieved by tuning the parameters of MPC based on a tuning algorithm. The controller is thus designed in the MATLAB environment and according to the gathered simulation environment results, the applied control method were best suitable for obtaining optimal control and the results were analyzed by performance measures. © 2006-2018 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).},

abstract={This experimental study on Al-SiC composite investigated the temperature distribution and microstructural characterization during pulsed current tungsten inert gas (PCTIG) welding. The parameters considered for PCTIG welding were peak current, base current, pulse frequency, and pulse on time. Experiments were designed and conducted using L9 orthogonal array technique. Regression model was developed to predict the ultimate tensile strength, bending load, cooling rate, and peak temperature. Statistical software was used to obtain the optimal PCTIG welding parameters, such as peak current of 160 A, base current of 60 A, pulse on time of 50 %, and pulse frequency of 5 Hz to attain desired result, including increased peak temperature of 446 °C, increased ultimate tensile strength of 138 MPa, and high cooling rate of 20 °C/s. Fine grain structures were also observed in weld region. Additionally, SEM fractography showed the difference in fracture surface between the PCTIG welding effects of different welding conditions. Statistical software was also used in identifying significant factors that caused improvement in weld strength, grain refinement in weld zone, and high cooling rate during PCTIG welding of Al-SiC composite. © 2018, The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The power quality compensator chosen in this paper is a DSTATCOM which integrates a three phase four leg Voltage Source Converter (VSC) with a DC capacitor. The major role of the DSTATCOM is to mitigate the components of harmonic/reactive current present in the line current thereby shapes the grid current to be sinusoidal and improves the power factor nearly unity under varying conditions. In addition DSATATCOM mitigates neutral current (Isn) and balances the load currents under unbalanced conditions in three phase four wire (3P4W) distribution system. The control strategy proposed for the DSTATCOM is a Neural Network (NN) based p-q-r theory with two Artificial Neural Network (ANN) controllers for a 3P4W distribution system. The reference signal for 3P3W Shunt Active Power Filter (SAPF) is calculated by implementing an ANN controller. The alleviation of Isn under unbalanced condition is achieved by another ANN controller which produces reference signal for the 1φ APF. The performance of the proposed DSTATCOM is analysed for various conditions through simulations in MATLAB SIMULINK and the simulation results justify the effectiveness of the propounded NN based control algorithm for DSTATCOM. © Copyright 2018 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

abstract={The electronic and optical properties of, Nitrogen (N), Cobalt (Co), and Co-N co-doped monolayers of MoS2 has been studied by using density functional theory (DFT) for visible light photocatalytic activity. From the calculations, it has been observed that the band gap of monolayer MoS2 has been reduced while doping. However, the band gaps of pristine and N doped MoS2 monolayers only falls in the visible region while for Co and Co-N co-doped systems, the band gap shifted to IR region. The optical calculation also confirms the results. The formation energy values of the doped system reaveal that MoS2 monolayer drops its stability while doping. To evaluate the photocatalytic response, band edge potentials of pristine and N-MoS2 are calculated, and the observed results show that compared to N-doped MoS2 monolayer, pure MoS2 is highly suitable for visible light photocatalytic dye degradation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Earlier literature underlines that oxidative stress plays a major role in the pathology of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury, diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM), diabetes mellitus (DM), fibrosis and hypertrophy which could adversely affect the normal cardiac function. However, the contributory role of oxidative stress in I/R pathology of heart with pre-existing abnormalities or diseases like DM and DCM remains to be explored. I/R injury was induced in normal (normal diet), DM (normal diet + streptozotocin: multiple low dose of 30 mg/kg) and DCM (high fat diet (40% fat) + streptozotocin: multiple low dose of 30 mg/kg) rat hearts using Langendorff isolated heart perfusion apparatus. Cardiac physiological recovery after I/R was assessed by hemodynamic parameters like LVDP, and LVSP, whereas cardiac injury was measured by tissue infarct size, and apoptosis, LDH, and CK release in coronary effluent. The oxidative stress was evaluated in myocardial homogenate, mitochondrial subpopulation, and microsomes. Reperfusing the ischemic DCM heart significantly deteriorated cardiac physiological recovery and elevated the cardiac injury (infarct size: 60%), compared to the control. But in DM heart, physiological recovery was prominent in the initial phase of reperfusion but deteriorated towards the end of reperfusion, supported by less infarct size. In addition, elevated lipid peroxidation (70% in DCM-I/R vs Sham) and impaired antioxidant enzymes (% decline vs Sham: GSH – 56% (DM), 63% (DCM); Catalase – 58% (DM), 35% (DCM); GPx – 19% (DM), 27% (DCM) and GR – 28% (DCM)) was observed in myocardial tissue from both DM and DCM. Interestingly, upon reperfusion, only normal heart showed significant deterioration in the antioxidant defense system. Collectively these results demonstrated that I/R induced oxidative stress is minimal in DM and DCM rat heart, despite high infarct size and low cardiac performance. This may be due to the prior adaptive modification in the antioxidant system associated with disease pathology. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={In this paper, we theoretically devised a spin torque nano-oscillator (STNO) with tilted polarizer (TP) with the help of two independent variables (β and θ). The spin torque induced magnetization precession dynamics is studied numerically by solving the governing Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski equation. The TP STNO free layer precession frequency is determined by varying TP angle (β) from 0° to 90°. For a particular value of β, we can vary (θ) the angle between the free layer magnetization and easy axis of magnetization from 0° to 90°. It is found that the frequency range is accessible at all tilt angles and highly tunable in the order of GHz. Also, the maximum operating frequency 124.5 GHz and corresponding power of 1.478 μ W/GHz/mA2 is obtained for β =60° and θ =90° with the applied current density of 10 × 1010 Am-2. Moreover, our results allow great freedom in choosing the detailed layer structure of the TP STNO and these findings pave a new route for the implementation of nanoscale microwave sources for future generation integrated electronics. © 1965-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer worldwide. The development of effective, inexpensive and safe chemopreventive agents would be of great benefit as it involves use of natural products to prevent or suppress the progression of precursor lesions. Morin a flavonoid found in figs (Ficus carica) and other plants is shown to inhibit 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) induced colon cancer progression in a short term and long term model of colon cancer rats; however, the molecular target for the colon cancer chemoprotective efficacy of morin is yet to be discovered. The present study aims to explore the molecular basis of how morin contributes to the chemoprevention with a focus on NF-κB signaling pathway. The effect of morin on NF-κB signaling in DMH-induced carcinogenic events such as inflammation and apoptosis were analyzed by studying the histopathological analysis using Hematoxylin and Eosin staining (H &E), mRNA expression using q-PCR, protein expression using Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and western blot. Morin supplementation to DMH administered rats down regulated NF-κB pathway and its downstream inflammatory mediators like tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) and prostaglandin (PGE-2). Morin supplementation to DMH administered rats alters BAX/BCL2 ratio favoring apoptosis in carcinogen treated rats. Our findings explored that molecular chemoprevention of morin targets NF-κB and acts as a potent anti-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic agent for colon cancer prevention. © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS},

abstract={Fabrication of anisotropic osteochondral-mimetic scaffold with mineralized subchondral zone and gradient interface remains challenging. We have developed an injectable semi-interpenetrating network hydrogel construct with chondroitin sulfate nanoparticles (ChS-NPs) and nanohydroxyapatite (nHA) (∼30–90 nm) in chondral and subchondral hydrogel zones respectively. Mineralized subchondral hydrogel exhibited significantly higher osteoblast proliferation and alkaline phosphatase activity (p < 0.05). Osteochondral hydrogel exhibited interconnected porous structure and spatial variation with gradient interface of nHA and ChS–NPs. Microcomputed tomography (μCT) demonstrated nHA gradation while rheology showed predominant elastic modulus (∼930 Pa) at the interface. Co–culture of osteoblasts and chondrocytes in gradient hydrogels showed layer–specific retention of cells and cell-cell interaction at the interface. In vivo osteochondral regeneration by biphasic (nHA or ChS) and gradient (nHA + ChS) hydrogels was compared with control using rabbit osteochondral defect after 3 and 8 weeks. Complete closure of defect was observed in gradient (8 weeks) while defect remained in other groups. Histology demonstrated collagen and glycosaminoglycan deposition in neo–matrix and presence of hyaline cartilage–characteristic matrix, chondrocytes and osteoblasts. μCT showed mineralized neo–tissue formation, which was confined within the defect with higher bone mineral density in gradient (chondral: 0.42 ± 0.07 g/cc, osteal: 0.64 ± 0.08 g/cc) group. Further, biomechanical push-out studies showed significantly higher load for gradient group (378 ± 56 N) compared to others. Thus, the developed nano-engineered gradient hydrogel enhanced hyaline cartilage regeneration with subchondral bone formation and lateral host-tissue integration. © 2018},

abstract={Sodium thiosulfate (STS) has shown promising effects in amelioration of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (IR) in a rat model and is clinically useful in the treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD) associated calciphylaxis. As the prevalence of cardiac complications is higher in CKD, we tested the effectiveness of STS in a rat model of adenine-induced vascular calcification and subjected the heart to IR. We observed an increased infarct size (29%) by TTC staining, lactate dehydrogenase (54%) and creatine kinase (32%) release in the coronary perfusate and altered hemodynamics compared to a normal rat treated with STS and subjected to IR. As functional mitochondria are essential for preserving heart from the detrimental effects of IR, we found that calcification induced mitochondrial dysfunction (reduced RCR->80%, P/O ratio->30%, ΔΨ->10% and swelling- 27%), could not be restored efficiently by STS treatment. Therefore we used nicorandil (mitochondrial potassium channel opener) along with STS as a combination therapy to treat the diseased heart and found an improvement in cardioprotection against IR injury, compared to STS alone. Upon evaluating these hearts, we found that both the cardiac mitochondria namely interfibrillar and subsarcolemmal were functionally well preserved. © 2018 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM)},

abstract={A simple green route was reported to prepare highly stable silver nanoparticles. The aqueous leaf extract of Durio zibethinus reduces Ag+ to Ag0 in the presence of natural sunlight. The capping and stabilization of dAgNPs by the phytoconstituents of Durio zibethinus was confirmed by FTIR. TEM confirms that the dAgNPs are spherical in shape with a size range between 10–25 nm. XRD pattern confirmed that the dAgNPs are arranged in the face-centred cubic structure. The catalytic activity of the dAgNPs was proved by sodium borohydride mediated reduction of nitro aromatic compounds and degradation hazardous organic dyes. The reaction kinetics was analysed by pseudo-first order equation. Regardless of the efficacy of degrading organic dyes, we showed by zebrafish mortality assay that the toxicity of the dye degraded water reduced drastically.

abstract={A biomimetic organic–inorganic composite system comprising of microspheres fabricated from combination of a biodegradable polymer poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) and bioactive mesoporous silica (SBA-15) has been developed through sintering technique for bone regeneration applications. The morphological and structural properties of the SBA-15/PLGA composite scaffold were evaluated using electron microscopy and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and the results showed spherical morphology and composite nature. The presence of mesopores in the silica was confirmed through nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms. The surface area and pore size of mesoporous silica were found to be 792 m2 g−1 and 3.7 nm, respectively. The thermal characteristics of the SBA-15/PLGA composites studied using thermogravimetry analysis shows a weight loss of around 80% with the degradation occurring at 324 °C. The prepared scaffold is also found to support the adhesion and proliferation of osteoblast cells. The expression of specific bone markers is significantly enhanced in the SBA-15/PLGA composite scaffold when compared with the pristine polymeric scaffold indicating the positive effect of mesoporous silica. Hence, these SBA-15/PLGA composite scaffolds can be explored further for bone regeneration applications. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Recently, there is an increasing demand for efficient and secure transreception of medical images in telemedicine applications. Though a fixed spectrum is allocated to each user, most of the time it remains unused by the concerned user. Cognitive Radio (CR) is a technology that utilizes the unused spectrum efficiently by adopting spectrum sensing concept. This paper proposes an efficient and secure transmission of medical images by adopting CR technology and image encryption technique. Firstly, the novel medical image encryption algorithm is proposed to encrypt the DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) image effectively. Then, the spectrum sensing technique is carried out via Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) to sense the unused frequency band to transmit the encrypted bio signal. The proposed encryption algorithm combines DNA (Deoxyribo Nucleic Acid) sequence operation and chaotic maps to successfully encrypt the DICOM image pixels. Experimental results are done and various analysis such as Unified Average Changing Intensity (UACI), Number of Pixel Changing Rate (NPCR), entropy estimation and chi-square tests are carried out to validate the sternness of the encryption algorithm. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Linear infrastructure networks like roads play a vital role in the socio-economic development of hill towns centered on tourism. Stability of the slopes along the hill roads are therefore a major concern and slope failures lead to disruption of traffic and loss of property/life or both. This study analyses the stability of cut-slopes along the Kodaikkanal – Palani hill road in the Western Ghats, India using rock mass classification systems like rock mass rating (RMR), slope mass rating (SMR) and continuous slope mass rating (CSMR). These geomechanical classifications provide a preliminary assessment of rock quality based on rock strength, discontinuity properties, hydrogeological condition of the slopes and slope stability based on the inherent rock strength parameters, discontinuity orientation and method of excavation. The results showed that both rock quality and discontinuity orientation contribute to type of failure in rock slopes with RMR > 40. SMR results are conservative while CSMR classification is matches more closely to the failures obtained from the field survey. CSMR classification represents continuous slope stability conditions and hence are more suitable for development of spatial database. Cutting of roads, thereby, steepening slopes has a definite influence on the stability of slopes. © 2018, Geological Society of India.},

abstract={The advantages and critical aspects of nanodimensional polymer-coated viral vector systems potentially applicable for gene delivery are reviewed. Various viral and nonviral vectors have been explored for gene therapy. Viral gene transfer methods, although highly efficient, are limited by their immunogenicity. Nonviral vectors have a lower transfection efficiency as a result of their inability to escape from the endosome. To overcome these drawbacks, novel nanotechnology-mediated interventions that involve the coating or modification of virus using polymers have emerged as a new paradigm in gene therapy. These alterations not only modify the tropism of the virus, but also reduce their undesirable interactions with the biological system. Also, co-encapsulation of other therapeutic agents in the polymeric coating may serve to augment the treatment efficacy. The viral particles can aid endosomal escape, as well as nuclear targeting, thereby enhancing the transfection efficiency. The integration of the desirable properties of both viral and nonviral vectors has been found beneficial for gene therapy by enhancing the transduction efficiency and minimizing the immune response. However, it is essential to ensure that these attempts should not compromise on the inherent ability of viruses to target and internalize into the cells and escape the endosomes.

abstract={A new pyrene-appended polypyridine ligand, wherein the 1,10-phenanthroline (phen) and the photoactive pyrene chromophore is connected via a C[dbnd]N bond; N-[1,10]phenanthrolin-5-yl-pyrenylmethanimine (ppym) and its complex [Ru(phen)2(ppym)]2+ was synthesized. Characterization of the ligand and the complex was investigated through elemental analysis, UV-vis, IR, 1H NMR, MALDI-TOF mass and cyclic voltammetry techniques. The change in dipole moment of the ground and the excited state of the chromophores with the different solvent polarity was examined. The dual emission (Excimer) characteristics observed for ligand ppym has been probed by detailed photophysical studies involving variable concentration, excitation wavelength and solvent experiments and also transition metal ion induced quenching data. 3MLCT emission was observed for [Ru(phen)2(ppym)]2+. Absorption, emission, thermal melting and viscosity studies reveal that [Ru(phen)2(ppym)]2+ bind to CT DNA avidly and that ruthenium-bound ppym intercalate inside the base sets of the duplex. Also, the DNA photonicking activity (pBR 322 DNA, λexc = 450 nm) of [Ru(phen)2(ppym)]2+ is almost four times higher than [Ru(phen)3]2+. Through inhibitor studies, we found that reactive oxygen species play a major role in the photo cleavage of [Ru(phen)2(ppym)]2+. The cytotoxicity of the complex was tested in Human cancer cell line (ZR-75-30) by MTT assay. In addition, modeling studies scaffold the intercalative binding to the d(CGCAATTGCG)2 sequence. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This paper reports the results of an experimental investigation of heat transfer from a wickless finned heat pipe charged with different self-rewetting fluids. The geometry considered for the experiments comprises an evaporator section of length 200 mm, condenser section of length 200 mm and adiabatic section of length 100 mm. Six constant area fins are placed internally along the length of the condenser. The width of the fin is 5 mm and the thickness is 1 mm. Adding internal fins at the condenser wall gives more surface area to the vapor for heat transfer. This gives additional condensation that keeps the evaporator at safe temperatures and extends the dry out condition. Additionally, fins break the condensed liquid film and augment heat transfer. The fill ratio considered in the present study is 50%. The self rewetting fluids considered in this work are butanol, pentanol, hexanol, and heptanol aqueous solutions. The concentrations of the self rewetting fluids are changed to study the thermal behavior of a heat pipe and the results are compared with those for water charged devices presented in literature. The thermosyphon is tested between power levels of 150 W (heat flux = 9182 W/m2) and 350 W (heat flux = 21424 W/m2). Results confirm superior thermal performance of self rewetting fluids compared to water. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Arsenic trioxide is one of the most common metallic pollutants entering the food chain both by human activities and nature. Its entry inside the living organism through food, air and water results into the accumulation of heavy metal in several tissues which manifest several metabolic or hormonal disorders. Till now the effect of arsenic trioxide on protein misfolding and aggregation culminating into several neurodegenerative disorders is poorly understood. In the present study, we reveal the aggregation process of Hen Egg White Lysozyme (HEWL) in presence of arsenic trioxide (As 2 O 3 ) at physiological conditions. We show that As 2 O 3 promote the in vitro aggregation of HEWL in concentration dependent manner. Early phase of aggregation is observed to be induced by exposure of hydrophobic surfaces which later reorganized to promote further self-association leading to β sheet structure. Presence of lower ordered oligomers after two days and higher ordered oligomers along with amorphous aggregates after week long incubation indicate that As 2 O 3 drives the self-assembly of lysozyme towards oligomeric form. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Advances in Metadata research have been instrumental in predictions and ‘fitness-of-use evaluation’ for the effective Decision-making process. For the past two decades, the model has been developed to provide visual assistance for assessing the quality information in metadata and quantifying the degree of metadata population. Still, there is a need to develop a framework that can be generic to adopt all the standards available for Geospatial Metadata. The computational analysis of metadata for specific applications remains uncharted for investigations and studies. This work proposes a computational framework for Geospatial Metadata by integrating TopicMaps and Hypergraphs (HXTM) based on the elements and their dependency relationships. A purpose-built dataset extracted from schemas of various standardisation organisations and existing knowledge in the discipline is utilised to model the framework and thereby evaluate ranking strategies. Hypergraph-Helly Property based Weight-Assignment Algorithm (HHWA) have been proposed for HXTM framework to calculate Stable weights for Metadata Elements. Recursive use of Helly-property ensures predominant elements, while Rank Order Centroid (ROC) method is used to compute standard weights. A real corpus using case studies from FGDC’s Standard for Geospatial Metadata, INSPIRE Metadata Standards, and ISRO Metadata Content Standard (NSDI 2.0) is used to validate the proposed framework. The observations show that the Information Gain (Entropy) of the proposed model along with the algorithm proves to be computationally smart for quantification purposes and visualises the strength of Metadata Elements for all applications. A prototype tool, ‘MetDEVViz- MetaData Editor, Validator & Visualization’ is designed to exploit the benefits of the proposed algorithm for the case studies that acts as a web service to provide a user interface for editing, validating and visualizing metadata elements. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={In this research, intelligent classifiers for disease diagnosis are designed that use classifier parameters, such as cost, tolerance, gamma and epsilon, with multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. The multiple objective functions are prediction accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. This paper employs a Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO), a variant of the classical Support Vector Machine (SVM), as the base classifier in conjunction with three popular evolutionary algorithms (EA), namely, Elephant Herding Optimization (EHO), Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm Based on Decomposition (MOEA/D) and Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II), for parameter evolution. A new cuboids based initial population generation mechanism was also introduced to hybridize EHO, called CEHO. The performance of CEHO is compared with the other three EAs (EHO, MOEA/D and NSGA-II) over 17 medical engineering datasets, and pertinent statistical tests were conducted to substantiate their performances. The results demonstrate that the proposed CEHO exhibit better to competitive results across all datasets. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Development of a durable and sustainable concrete especially with natural fibres has been one of the major focus areas of industrial and academic world in recent years. Among the natural fibres the basalt is considered to have exceptional properties with respect to durability. The deterioration of concrete due to chemicals occurs by movement of fluids like water, ions etc. which react and decompose hydrated products in concrete and in-turn leads to leaching. In the event of severe fire exposure, the concrete loses its strength and may suffer severe damage. Thus reinforcing concrete with high thermally and chemically stable basalt fibre can prevent damages by reducing penetration of ions and thermal cracks in concrete. This paper presents durability studies on basalt fibre reinforced concrete (BFRC) in chemical solutions, carbonation, rapid chloride penetration and fire. BFRC showed strong resistance to acid solutions, chloride penetration and fire. The performance of BFRC was found better than control concrete. BFRC have 70% less carbonation to control concrete whereas chloride ion permeability of the control concrete was 49% more than BFRC at the age of 56 days. BFRC retained 82.57% and 89.53% of its compressive strength in 28 days after immersion in NaOH and HCl respectively, whereas, control concrete retained 60.51% and 72.36%. Residual compressive strength of BFRC at 800°C was 65.98% whereas it was only 52.29% for control concrete. © 2018 Associated Cement Companies Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Blood leucocytes segmentation in medical images is viewed as difficult process due to the variability of blood cells concerning their shape and size and the difficulty towards determining location of Blood Leucocytes. Physical analysis of blood tests to recognize leukocytes is tedious, time-consuming and liable to error because of the various morphological components of the cells. Segmentation of medical imagery has been considered as a difficult task because of complexity of images, and also due to the non-availability of leucocytes models which entirely captures the probable shapes in each structures and also incorporate cell overlapping, the expansive variety of the blood cells concerning their shape and size, various elements influencing the outer appearance of the blood leucocytes, and low Static Microscope Image disparity from extra issues outcoming about because of noise. We suggest a strategy towards segmentation of blood leucocytes using static microscope images which is a resultant of three prevailing systems of computer vision fiction: enhancing the image, Support vector machine for segmenting the image, and filtering out non ROI (region of interest) on the basis of Local binary patterns and texture features. Every one of these strategies are modified for blood leucocytes division issue, in this manner the subsequent techniques are very vigorous when compared with its individual segments. Eventually, we assess framework based by compare the outcome and manual division. The findings outcome from this study have shown a new approach that automatically segments the blood leucocytes and identify it from a static microscope images. Initially, the method uses a trainable segmentation procedure and trained support vector machine classifier to accurately identify the position of the ROI. After that, filtering out non ROI have proposed based on histogram analysis to avoid the non ROI and chose the right object. Finally, identify the blood leucocytes type using the texture feature. The performance of the foreseen approach has been tried in appearing differently in relation to the system against manual examination by a gynaecologist utilizing diverse scales. A total of 100 microscope images were used for the comparison, and the results showed that the proposed solution is a viable alternative to the manual segmentation method for accurately determining the ROI. We have evaluated the blood leucocytes identification using the ROI texture (LBP Feature). The identification accuracy in the technique used is about 95.3%., with 100 sensitivity and 91.66% specificity. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Music has the potential to invoke strong emotions, both positive and negative, wherein positive emotions can augment well-being. The objective of this study was to analyze the dynamic emotional responses of the participants to self-selected music using Electroencephalography (EEG). The frequency localization with respect to time for the given stimulus (liked and disliked music) in various EEG bands was established by implementing a multi-resolution analysis algorithm using Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD).Ten healthy adults with an average age of 20 years (without any formal training in music) participated in this study. The perceived emotion of the participants was assessed using Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) scale and brain activity,while they were listening to music,was recorded using EEG. A high frontal asymmetry index score was noted at mid-frontal (F3 and F4) and lateral frontal (F7 and F8) electrode locations indicating positive emotion. The result suggests that playing the disliked music elicits neither negative emotion nor positive emotion as the changes were noted only at lateral frontal (F4 and F3). Apart from these, there was an increase in the theta band energy of the frontal midline only for liked music and increased beta component energy was observed only at frontal electrode locations while listening to disliked music. The participants’ perceived emotion (valence/arousal) matched with induced emotion for liked music whereas for disliked music only the arousal component was similar. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In this study, enhancement of heat transfer for the fluid passing through the corrugated pipe with magnetic flux is made with the support of numerical simulation and optimisation techniques. The numerical simulation is carried out in the computational fluid dynamics approach, and the flow behaviour and surface heat transfer coefficients are predicted. The flow domain is created as a two-dimensional geometry in GAMBIT package, and the flow field is numerically simulated in Fluent software. The double precession pressure-based solver is employed to solve the governing equations, and the results from the numerical simulation are validated with benchmark results. Later optimisation techniques are employed to identify the best value for the control parameters like groove diameter, pitch distance between groove, inflow velocity and magnetic flux on heat transfer enhancement. The best value of control parameters enhances the heat transfer by 2.3 times with reference to a straight pipe. Also, regression models are developed to predict the heat transfer coefficient for any combination of control parameters. © 2018 Engineers Australia},

Comparing with other literatures, we find that our method has the least computation time as low as 0.9 ms. We achieved a highest accuracy of 92.67–100% with Decision tree classifier for the four types of two class classification problem considered. Our method being very simple and also has fastest computation time in comparison with other features in the literature and thus can form as a software tool that can be installed easily and also opens future opportunities towards real time detection and prediction of epileptic seizures. © 2018 The Author(s)},

abstract={The recent developments of internet technology have created premium space for recommender system (RS) to help users in their daily life. An effective personalized recommendation of a travel recommender system can reduce time and travel cost of the travellers. ProTrip RS addresses the personalization problem through exploiting user interests and preferences to generate suggestions. Data considered for the recommendations include travel sequence, actions, motivations, opinions and demographic information of the user. ProTrip is completely designed to be intelligent and in addition, the ProTrip is a health-centric RS which is capable of suggesting the food availability through considering climate attributes based on user’s personal choice and nutritive value. A novel functionality of ProTrip supports travellers with long-term diseases and followers of strict diet. The ProTrip is built on the pillars of ontological knowledge base and tailored filtering mechanisms. The gap between heterogeneous user profiles and descriptions is bridged using semantic ontologies. The effectiveness of recommendations is enhanced through a hybrid model of blended filtering approaches, and results prove that the proposed ProTrip to be a proficient system. The developed food recommendation approach is evaluated for the real-time IoT-based healthcare support system. We also present a detailed case study on the food recommendation-based health management. The proposed system is evaluated on real-time dataset, and analysis of the results shows improved accuracy and efficiency compared to existing models. © 2018 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature},

abstract={Kinesin Spindle Protein (KSP) or Eg5 is an essential kinesin that is involved in spindle separation process during mitosis and also unregulated in certain cancer cells. Inhibitors of this enzyme have proved to be effective to block spindle separation followed by mitotic arrest and apoptosis of the cancer cells. Since this enzyme has two allosteric inhibitor binding sites, it's an excellent target for developing drugs for cancer chemotherapy. Many pyrimidine derivatives have been proved to be active against cancer and other enzymes. In this report, we have synthesized a set ten novel N-(1-(6-acetamido-5-phenylpyrimidin-4-yl)piperidin-3-yl)amide derivatives and have evaluated their activity against the KSP. The SAR of these active compounds was further analyzed using in silico molecular docking studies using GOLD and AutoDock softwares. All these compounds form hydrophobic interaction, aromatic π-π stacking and hydrogen bond efficiently with the Eg5. © 2018},

abstract={We investigate the effect of repulsive coupling together with an attractive coupling in a network of nonlocally coupled oscillators. To understand the complex interaction between these two couplings we introduce a control parameter in the repulsive coupling which plays a crucial role in inducing distinct complex collective patterns. In particular, we show the emergence of various cluster chimera death states through a dynamically distinct transition route, namely the oscillatory cluster state and coherent oscillation death state as a function of the repulsive coupling in the presence of the attractive coupling. In the oscillatory cluster state, the oscillators in the network are grouped into two distinct dynamical states of homogeneous and inhomogeneous oscillatory states. Further, the network of coupled oscillators follow the same transition route in the entire coupling range. Depending upon distinct coupling ranges, the system displays different number of clusters in the death state and oscillatory state. We also observe that the number of coherent domains in the oscillatory cluster state exponentially decreases with increase in coupling range and obeys a power-law decay. Additionally, we show analytical stability for observed solitary state, synchronized state, and incoherent oscillation death state. © 2018 American Physical Society.},

abstract={Nowadays the concept of mobile cloud computing has been used widely. Its native problems such as limited battery life time, scarcity of resources, frequent disconnections and mobility are very challenging to accomplish. These problems can be addressed by mobile cloud computing by offloading the mobile applications to cloud that is external to the mobile device. Partial mobile application offloading is only advisable. To evaluate your application performance profiling is done. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis for an energy-efficient computational offloading research and it highlights a distinct pattern which concludes whether to offload or not to offload. Mobile to mobile task splitting and offloading is done when it is unfeasible to reach the cloud and it improves the performance and saves energy. But still many challenges with a censuring analysis have not yet been fully met. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Mobile devices are resource restrichtion devices (i.e.) size and facilities are inversely proportional. While executing the computational intensive jobs in mobile devices, power system is getting drained very fast. Computational time of application and power consumption in mobile devices are directly proportional. Cloud computing is emerging technology to solve many problems. Cloud computing are getting ready to give their hands to solve. Mobile computing and cloud computing are joined their hands to have good hope. Computational intensive tasks are offloaded to rich resourceful server. Cloud resources are heterogeneity in nature. It creates a challenge in terms of assigning the offloaded tasks in VM machine in efficient manner. The main objective of this paper is to find optimized mapping between offloaded task and cloud resource. First we executed the workflow in mobile alone. Then we observed that It consumes more time to complete and also gain more energy. Then we conducted the experiment on homogeneous and heterogeneous configurations of virtual machines for scheduling the offloaded task to have a least completion time. Finally we found optimal mapping between offloaded task with virtual machines in terms of cost and power consumption. © 2017 IEEE.},

In current scenario, security for images required more attention, specifically when sensitive images are communicated over insecure public domain networks. A new dual layer image cryptosystem is developed by combining two chaotic maps. The proposed image cryptosystem is the combination of key generation, confusion and diffusion process. Chaotic key series are generated using Arnold cat map and two dimensional logistic map. In confusion phase the pixel positions are scrambled. The generated chaotic key image of two dimensional logistic map and confused image are arranged as a blocks and all blocks are shuffled using Arnold cat map. The shuffled chaotic block series are used to diffuse the confused block image. Simulation results on default standard test images and comparison with recent existing encryption schemes evidenced the dominance of the proposed scheme. © 2017 IEEE.},

NOIZEUS database is utilized to create the noisy speech. Speech recognition system is evaluated on noisy test speeches at 0 dB SNR and based on the experimental results the robustness of the proposed algorithm is revealed in recognising continuous speeches. Based on the computation of the Euclidean distance between test features and clusters with and without the use of adaptive filtering algorithms is utilized for this. The performance of these features and adaptive algorithm for noise removal is tested on speeches chosen from 'NOISEUS' database with noise samples taken from 'AURORA' database. These perceptual features are evaluated with an average accuracy of 53% and 100% for speech recognition for the test speeches at 0db SNR without and with the use of adaptive filtering algorithm respectively. Here an adaptive filter with eight filter coefficients is adaptively changed to generate the noise reduced speech. The perceptual features are extracted from this and subsequently applied to the speech models and based on the minimum distance criterion, correct speech is identified, and the accuracy is found to be 100%. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Due to the significant advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT) in the healthcare sector, the security, and the integrity of the medical data became big challenges for healthcare services applications. This paper proposes a hybrid security model for securing the diagnostic text data in medical images. The proposed model is developed through integrating either 2-D discrete wavelet transform 1 level (2D-DWT-1L) or 2-D discrete wavelet transform 2 level (2D-DWT-2L) steganography technique with a proposed hybrid encryption scheme. The proposed hybrid encryption schema is built using a combination of Advanced Encryption Standard, and Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman algorithms. The proposed model starts by encrypting the secret data; then it hides the result in a cover image using 2D-DWT-1L or 2D-DWT-2L. Both color and gray-scale images are used as cover images to conceal different text sizes. The performance of the proposed system was evaluated based on six statistical parameters; the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), mean square error (MSE), bit error rate (BER), structural similarity (SSIM), structural content (SC), and correlation. The PSNR values were relatively varied from 50.59 to 57.44 in case of color images and from 50.52 to 56.09 with the gray scale images. The MSE values varied from 0.12 to 0.57 for the color images and from 0.14 to 0.57 for the gray scale images. The BER values were zero for both images, while SSIM, SC, and correlation values were ones for both images. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, the proposed model proved its ability to hide the confidential patient's data into a transmitted cover image with high imperceptibility, capacity, and minimal deterioration in the received stego-image. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={The present study was aimed to identify the active anti-glycation constituent from the leaves of Sesbania grandiflora. Characterization of the active constituent resulted in the identification of hydroxy methoxy benzaldehyde (HMB). The potential of HMB as anti-glycation lead was analyzed by fluorescence spectroscopy, fluorescence microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and molecular interaction studies. Our results suggested that HMB inhibited formation of early (HbA1c) and advanced glycation end products (AGEs). The amyloid-like fibrillation in hemoglobin was also inhibited by HMB. SEM images indicated the protective effect against the formation of acanthocytes. Molecular docking studies showed that HMB was interacting with hemoglobin through hydrogen bonds with Arg141, Tyr140, and Thr137. Our findings suggest that HMB could be a better anti-glycation lead molecule towards novel AGEs inhibitors. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Besides inactivating tumour suppressor activity in cells, mutations in p53 confer significant oncogenic functions and promote metastasis and resistance to anticancer therapy. A variety of therapies involving genetic and epigenetic signalling events regulate tumorogenesis and progression in such cases. Pharmacological interventions with HDAC inhibitors have shown promise in therapy. This work explores the changes in efficacy of the four HDAC inhibitors SAHA, MS-275, valproic acid and sodium butyrate on a panel of colon cancer cell lines–HCT116 (p53 wt), HCT116 p53-/-, HT29 and SW480 (with mutations in p53). Clonogenic assays, gene profiling and epigenetic expression done on these cells point to p53 dependent differential activity of the 4 HDAC inhibitors which also elevate methylation levels in p53 mutant cell lines. In silico modelling establishes the alterations in interactions that lead to such differential activity of valproic acid, one of the inhibitors considered for the work. Molecular Dynamic simulations carried out on the valproic acid complex ensure stability of the complex. This work establishes a p53 dependent epigenetic signalling mechanism triggered by HDAC inhibition expanding the scope of HDAC inhibitors in adjuvant therapy for p53 mutant tumours. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Progress in the technology of submicron semiconductor device, which makes a short-channel and quantum effects, having equations of nonlinear modelling, leads to complicated and time-consuming calculations. In order to control these complexities and obtain the device characteristics according to device parameters, a faster method is needed. In this paper, a combinational algorithm is proposed for modelling a nano silicon-on-insulator metal–oxide–semiconductor field effect transistor (SOI MOSFET) characteristic. The proposed method shows the same device characteristics with lower input parameters. In this method, a combination of genetic algorithm (GA) and artificial neural network are used. Then quantum evolutionary algorithm (QEA) is employed instead of genetic algorithm (GA) for comparing and modifying algorithm. Results show that the algorithm’s accuracy is 95% and 98% for test data of GA and QGA, respectively. Moreover, the reduction percentage of input parameters are 11% and 52% for GA and QEA, respectively. The simulation results represent that the implemented quantum genetic algorithm for prediction of device characteristics is more effective and accurate than GA. © 2018 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature},

abstract={Path planning algorithms have been used in different applications with the aim of finding a suitable collision-free path which satisfies some certain criteria such as the shortest path length and smoothness; thus, defining a suitable curve to describe path is essential. The main goal of these algorithms is to find the shortest and smooth path between the starting and target points. This paper makes use of a Bézier curve-based model for path planning. The control points of the Bézier curve significantly influence the length and smoothness of the path. In this paper, a novel Chaotic Particle Swarm Optimization (CPSO) algorithm has been proposed to optimize the control points of Bézier curve, and the proposed algorithm comes in two variants: CPSO-I and CPSO-II. Using the chosen control points, the optimum smooth path that minimizes the total distance between the starting and ending points is selected. To evaluate the CPSO algorithm, the results of the CPSO-I and CPSO-II algorithms are compared with the standard PSO algorithm. The experimental results proved that the proposed algorithm is capable of finding the optimal path. Moreover, the CPSO algorithm was tested against different numbers of control points and obstacles, and the CPSO algorithm achieved competitive results. © 2018 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature},

abstract={The reliability issues are major concern in safety, mission, and business-critical applications such as Aircraft flight control, Aerospace applications, Defense communications, Bank transactions, etc. There will be immense loss if these systems do not operate in the field, i.e. in real time. The responsibility of designers and engineers is to build highly reliable intelligent systems by adding redundancy like hardware, software, information and time. To raise the reliability of the system, the hardware redundancy is used in this study. In the era of microelectronics reliability, the triple modular redundancy (TMR) configuration is the most common technique used to mitigate one single event upset (SEU) error. This work mainly focuses on majority voting of quintuple modular redundancy (QMR) system to tolerate two SEU errors for the betterment of reliability. Three proposed majority voters of QMR or 5-MR configurations were discussed, analyzed and implemented in this study. Simulation results show that the first proposed 5-MR design offers a better figure-of-merit (FOM-52.55), a lower delay (0.390 ns) and lower power dissipation (367.8 µm2) than others. The lower power dissipation (7.633 µW) is achieved by the second proposed method with good FOM (48). Also, three application examples, namely logical AND, synthetic highs and image fusion are implemented on Altera FPGA EP4CE115F29C7 device using Quartus II synthesis tool using the proposed Q-MR configuration approaches. Simulation results show that the proposed methods offer better results than the existing method. © 2018 Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature},

abstract={Surface coverage parameter of an electrochemical sensor plays a vital role in enhancing the figure of merits of the sensor. Developing a theoretical model for the surface coverage will help to standardize the fabrication of working electrodes used in electrochemical sensors. In this background, a wavelet based spectral algorithm has been developed to model the surface coverage of an arsenic sensor. For the model, Michaelis-Menten constant of fluorine doped cadmium oxide (F-doped CdO) working electrode based arsenic sensor was used as the seed fount. Theoretical analysis for the estimation of surface coverage based on Michaelis-Menten constant with nonlinear reaction-diffusion equation is considered. In order to estimate the Michaelis-Menten constant and maximum current response, the measured current values are linearized with the help of Hanes-woolf plot. Using the Legendre wavelet spectral approach, the nonlinear reaction-diffusion equation is converted into a system of algebraic equations through operational matrix of derivatives. The surface coverage was determined using Legendre wavelets and this method can be determined the desired surface coverage for detecting arsenic in water of specific range. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Aluminium - silicon carbide (Al - SiC) metal matrix composite is produced with following wt % of SiC reinforcement (4%, 8% & 12%) using stir casting method. Mechanical testing such as micro hardness, tensile testing and bend testing were performed. Characterizations, namely micro structure, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, inductive coupled plasma - optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis, were carried out on Al - SiC composites. The presence of SiC on Al - SiC composite is confirmed through XRD technique and microstructure. The percentage of SiC was confirmed through ICP-OES technique. Increase in weight percentage of SiC tends to increase micro hardness, ultimate strength & yield strength but it reduces the bend strength and elongation (%) of the material. SEM factrography of tensile tested fractured samples of Al - 8% SiC & Al - 12% SiC showed fine dimples on fractured surface & coarse dimples fractured surface respectively. This showed significant fracture differences between Al - 8% SiC & Al - 12% SiC. From the above experiment, Al - 8% SiC had good micro hardness, ultimate strength & yield strength without significant loss in elongation (%) & bend strength. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The ultimate goal of all production entities is to select the process parameters that would be of maximum strength, minimum wear and friction. The friction and wear are serious problems in most of the industries which are influenced by the working set of parameters, oxidation characteristics and mechanism involved in formation of wear. The experimental input parameters such as sliding distance, applied load, and temperature are utilized in finding out the optimized solution for achieving the desired output responses such as coefficient of friction, wear rate, and volume loss. The optimization is performed with the help of a novel method, Elitist Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) based on an evolutionary algorithm. The regression equations obtained using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) are used in determining the optimum process parameters. Further, the results achieved through desirability approach in RSM are compared with that of the optimized solution obtained through NSGA-II. The results conclude that proposed evolutionary technique is much effective and faster than the desirability approach. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Augmented Reality (AR) plays a vital role in the field of visual computing. AR is actually different but often confused to be the same is Virtual Reality (VR). While VR creates a whole new world, AR aims at designing an environment in real time with virtual components that are overlaid on the real components. Due to this reason, AR comes under the category of 'mixed reality'. AR could be viewed on any smart electronic gadgets like mobile, laptop, projector, tablet etc., AR could be broadly classified as Markerbased and Markerless. If it is marker-based, a pattern is used whereas in markerless system there is no need of it. In case of marker, if we show the pattern to a webcam it will get details about it and impose the object on the marker. We are incorporating a new efficient solution for integrating a virtual object on to a real world which can be very much handful for tourism and advertisement for showcasing objects or things.

abstract={India is a highly populated agricultural country which has land area of 60.3% for agriculture purpose. The production of rice plant is decreased up to 20–30% because of various diseases. The most frequent diseases occurred in paddy leaves are leaf blast, leaf blight, false smut, brown spot and leaf streak. This paper mainly considers a method to detect the leaf diseases automatically using image processing techniques. To determine these diseases, the proposed methodology involves image Acquisition, image pre-processing, segmentation and classification of paddy leaf disease. In this proposed system, the features are extracted using hybrid method of discrete wavelet transform, scale invariant feature transform and gray scale co-occurrence matrix approach. Finally, the extracted features are given to various classifiers such as K nearest neighborhood neural network, back propagation neural network, Naïve Bayesian and multiclass SVM to categorize disease and non-disease plants. Many classification techniques are examined to classify the leaf disease. In experimental result, the proposed work is implemented in MATLAB software and performance of this work is measured in terms of accuracy. It is observed that multi class SVM provides the better accuracy of 98.63% when compared to other classifiers. © 2018 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature},

abstract={This study aims to reduce the cost of the bricks and usage of clay, cement, sand for brick manufacturing. This paper presents the results of the compressive strength and impact resistance of fly ash bricks with the addition of least expensive plastic wastes (FAB-P). India pulverized fuel ash under low lime (Cao<10%) was used, and the constituent of the material is fly ash, cement 10%, regular rounded plastic waste 20-40%, portable water. The FAB-P casted for the dimension of 220 x 103 x 103mm. The cost, water absorption, compressive strength, drop hammer impact strength of clay brick, standard factory outlet fly ash brick (FAB-F); FAB with the addition of plastic waste was compared. It is observed that the plastic added FAB-P have 200% higher impact resistance than the other bricks. Also, the compressive strength of FAB-P was improved gradually up to 40% of the addition of plastic material. © IAEME Publication},

abstract={Traditional roof systems are constructed with concrete and weathering coarse layer and these roof systems absorb and reflect a certain amount of solar radiation. The absorbed solar energy is transferred into building indoor and causes significant discomfort to the occupants. Also, this solar energy gets dissipated without any useful energy conversion. Hence this paper is focused to use the available solar energy effectively through a novel solar water heating system and the transfer of heat in the building indoor is arrested by proper roof insulation material. The modified insulated roof with the solar water heater is designed and simulated numerically in commercial computational fluid dynamics code with validation. Through this study, the factors that affect the performance of solar water heating system and thermal insulation capacity are analysed and the best design of the modified roof system is identified. The modified roof system produces 25 L of hot water per day with a temperature raise of 60°C in the winter season. Also, the same roof system maintains the ceiling temperature at about 27°C for a complete day in a summer season. © 2018, Indian Academy of Sciences.},

The oil obtained from Pinnai (Calophyllum inophyllum) seed, a non-edible feedstock, was used for biodiesel production. The reaction was catalyzed by immobilized lipase. It was found that lipase immobilized on silica aerogel provided highest percentage yield of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) compared to other matrixes. The most significant finding of the research was that the lipase immobilized on silica aerogel showed negligible reduction in FAME yields even after 8 cycles of reuse, thus providing a real, cost-effective option for biodiesel production.

abstract={In any therapeutic modality the usage of drug in high doses often leads to serious side-effects. Herein, we demonstrated a method to enhance the antibacterial efficacy of CuS NPs at lower concentration through interacting with jackfruit seed lectin, jacalin. Fluorescence quenching studies revealed that jacalin form complex with CuS NPs and the association constant was 1.91 × 104 M−1. Upon complex with jacalin, the bacterial minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of CuS NPs drastically decreases from 12.5 μM to 0.78 μM. The addition of jacalin specific sugar, galactose to jacalin-CuS NPs complex (JCuS NPs) reverses the MIC from 0.78 μM to 25 μM. Mechanistic study suggests that JCuS NPs kills bacteria in part by reactive oxygen species and membrane damage, but galactose prevents the action of JCuS NPs at 0.78 μM. JCuS NPs successfully reduce (14 fold) A. hydrophila colonization in an infected zerbra fish and rescue them completely from the infection, but galJCuS NPs and CuS NPs were ineffective at 0.78 μM. Collectively, our studies demonstrates that the enhance antibacterial activity of JCuS NPs is likely due to the interaction between the galactose binding site of jacalin and the bacterial strains, as a result NPs are targeted and delivered sufficiently. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

But, our proposed method based on Legendre wavelets and algebraic polynomials require only 2 ( k - 1 )M connection coefficients instead of 2 ( k - 1 )M2. Also the convergence analysis and error estimation for the proposed function approximation through the truncated series have been discussed and approved with the exact solution.

abstract={This paper presents the mechanical behavior of concrete mixes containing Used Foundry Sand (UFS) as partial replacement for fine aggregates. Used Foundry Sand is a by-product from ferrous and non ferrous metal casting industry. Sand removed from foundry is called as Used Foundry Sand and this research is carried out for large scale utilization for fine aggregate in concrete as partial replacement. Experimental investigations are carried out to determine compressive strength, split tensile strength, flexural strength are examined. Replacement for fine aggregate was carried out with three percentages (10%, 20%, 30% and 40%) by weight of UFS. Test results revealed that marginal increase in strength properties of concrete containing 30% UFS as partial replacement of fine aggregate and it can be used in concrete production without affecting strength properties. © 2018 IAEME Publication.

abstract={In the present work, an attempt is made to reduce scavenging problems by developing a new model of two-stroke spark-ignition engine. This model allows a flow of fresh air through intake valves positioned at the bottom of the cylinder and exit of burnt gases through exhaust ports situated at the top of cylinder. The exhaust ports are closed by the piston as it moves towards bottom of the cylinder following which gasoline is injected minimizing the possibility of mixing of fuel with outgoing exhaust gases. During expansion the piston unravels the exhaust ports and the burnt gases escape to the atmosphere due to pressure difference. Due to low density at high temperatures, the exhaust gases naturally rise against the direction of gravity reducing the possibility of mixing with incoming fresh air. Further, a comparative study of fuel distribution inside the cylinder has shown greater distribution when injection takes place against gravity than along gravity, which promotes cleaner combustion. The combustion analysis is done using Diesel-RK software and flow analysis is done using ANSYS FLUENT. © 2006-2018 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).},

abstract={We investigate the occurrence of collective dynamical states such as transient amplitude chimera, stable amplitude chimera, and imperfect breathing chimera states in a locally coupled network of Stuart-Landau oscillators. In an imperfect breathing chimera state, the synchronized group of oscillators exhibits oscillations with large amplitudes, while the desynchronized group of oscillators oscillates with small amplitudes, and this behavior of coexistence of synchronized and desynchronized oscillations fluctuates with time. Then, we analyze the stability of the amplitude chimera states under various circumstances, including variations in system parameters and coupling strength, and perturbations in the initial states of the oscillators. For an increase in the value of the system parameter, namely, the nonisochronicity parameter, the transient chimera state becomes a stable chimera state for a sufficiently large value of coupling strength. In addition, we also analyze the stability of these states by perturbing the initial states of the oscillators. We find that while a small perturbation allows one to perturb a large number of oscillators resulting in a stable amplitude chimera state, a large perturbation allows one to perturb a small number of oscillators to get a stable amplitude chimera state. We also find the stability of the transient and stable amplitude chimera states and traveling wave states for an appropriate number of oscillators using Floquet theory. In addition, we also find the stability of the incoherent oscillation death states. © 2018 Author(s).},

abstract={Mathematical programming is an art that provides precise techniques for solving a class of problems. Many industrial problems require Discrete Mathematical (DM) structures with which techniques can be developed to solve many well-posed problems. Hypergraph is one such DM tool which can address essential parts of intelligent computing in many industrial problems, the importance due to the need for accruing data from a sensor like devices for further analysis especially in applications such as boiler flue gas analysis, safety engineering etc. Various data classification schemes involve feature extraction techniques that provide intelligent measures to take an appropriate decision based on machine intelligence and hence Feature extraction from in Boiler Flue Gases (BFG) can be considered as an Industrial Information Integration research problem. A wide variety of feature extraction techniques has been reported to literature. But not many classifiers that exploit geometrical and topological features of the database have been utilized to design computationally efficient classifiers. In this paper, a Hypergraph (HG)-based feature extraction technique is developed in order to derive both topological and geometrical features through hyperedges that describe n-ary relations among the data containing feature vectors. These HG features obtained using Helly property of HG, have then been utilized to train a PNN (HGPNN) to classify the frequency responses of the sensors which can correspond to various mass concentrations of flue gas by detecting the nonlinearity. The classification capability of this HGPNN has been validated with the VOC benchmark data set. The classification capability of the proposed HGPNN has been analyzed first for the flue gas data acquired from ORSAT analyzer and then for the data from KANE® analyzer. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Objective: Herbal medicine products contribute a considerable part of the pharmaceutical market all over the world. Quality control of herbal medicines remains an obstacle in the herbal industry due to the existence of adulterants. Although some chemical methods are being employed to differentiate the herbal adulterants, they are time-consuming, costly and environmentally hazardous due to the use of dangerous chemicals. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop a rapid and reliable analytical method for the identification of herbal adulterants. Methods: In the present study, the authors have employed different techniques such as Microscopy, Phytochemical screening, high-performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC), gas chromatography coupled with mass spectroscopy (GC–MS) and near infra-red spectroscopy (NIRS) methods to differentiate Piper nigrum (black pepper) and its adulterant papaya seeds. Results: Based on the results, microscopic method was found to be helpful to differentiate the herbal adulterants but required a lot of time and skilled human resource. Phytochemical methods are useful, but the process of extract preparation requiring the use of hazardous chemicals is not an environmentally friendly approach. The analytical techniques like HPTLC, GC–MS, and NIRS are useful methods, but require sophisticated instrumentation and skilled human resources involving time-consuming sample preparation steps. Conclusion: In addition to conventional Botanical and Chemical characterization, NIRS was also found to be a very efficient, rapid and accurate technique for differentiating black pepper and papaya seed powders without the necessity for any sample preparation step. © 2018 Elsevier GmbH},

abstract={Welding is an integral part of component fabrication in industry. Even though the science and art of welding are more than 100 years old, defects continue to occur during welding. Codes of practice require that the welds be tested and evaluated. Conventionally ultrasonic testing has been widely applied in industry for the detection and evaluation of the flaws/defects in the weldments. With advances in sensor and signal analysis technologies, the last two decades have seen extensive developments in the field of ultrasonic testing. We have advanced techniques such as Time of Flight Diffraction (TOFD) which has better probability of detection for linear defects. A major irritant during the application of TOFD, especially for the testing of carbon steel weldments, is the presence of noise. A variety of approaches has been used internationally for the suppression of such noise and each has its own merits and demerits. This paper focuses on a method of enhancing the TOFD A-scan signals in carbon steel weldments by suppressing the noise from them using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT). The analysis clearly indicates that the DWT gives better signal-to-noise ratio improvement using higher-order wavelet filters with 4-level DWT decomposition. However the computational cost of this signal enhancement depends on the wavelet filter chosen along with the chosen level of DWT decomposition. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={ZnSe nanotubes were constructed and optimized in order to analyze the adsorption behaviour of environmentally hazardous gases such as SO 2 and CO 2 by using density functional analysis. Different sites on the nanotubes, such as Zn and Se, were studied for adsorption energy, Mullikan population and the recovery time of the ZnSe nanotube during the adsorption process. The obtained results show that compared to SO 2 molecules, the ZnSe nanotubes are more reactive to CO 2 molecules. To study the electronic transport properties of the ZnSe nanotubes with and without gas molecules, a two-probe system was constructed and the transport properties were studied by implementing a non-equilibrium Green’s function. The transport properties were analyzed in terms of the device density of states, transmission curves and the V–I characteristics. The results confirm that the ZnSe nanotubes are more favourable for CO 2 molecules compared to the SO 2 molecules. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Over the decades, the survival rates for oral cancer have not improved despite development in novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Therefore, the present study is aimed at investigating the chemopreventive potential of parthenolide in DMBA-induced hamster buccal pouch carcinogenesis. The hamsters were divided into 4 groups (n = 6/group). Group I was treated as control. Groups II and III were painted with a solution of 0.5% DMBA three times per week for 14 weeks on the left buccal pouches. In addition, group III were orally administrated with parthenolide 2 mg/kg b.w on days alternate to the DMBA application. Group IV received only parthenolide. At the end of 14th week all hamsters were sacrificed. Buccal tissues from all hamsters were evaluated for histopathology. Biochemical studies were carried out using plasma, liver, and buccal mucosa of control and experimental hamsters. Gene and protein expression studies of apoptotic markers p53, Bcl-2, and Bax were performed. The results showed 100% tumor formation and marked alterations in histopathology, status of detoxification enzymes, lipid peroxidation, and antioxidant profile in group II hamsters. Oral administration of parthenolide completely prevented tumor formation and significantly reduced the severity of histopathological changes in group III hamsters. The status of detoxification enzymes, lipid peroxidation, and antioxidants were significantly restored in parthenolide treated group compared to group II hamsters. The apoptotic gene p53 and antiapoptotic gene Bcl-2 were significantly down regulated; whereas, pro-apoptotic gene Bax was up regulated in group III hamsters compared to group II. The results of the present study suggest that parthenolide have potent chemopreventive, antioxidant, and apoptotic effect in DMBA-induced oral carcinogenesis. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={In this study, the flexural fatigue performance of concrete beams made with 100% Coarse Recycled Concrete Aggregates (RCA) and 100% Coarse Natural Aggregates (NA) were statistically commanded. For this purpose, the experimental fatigue test results of earlier researcher were investigated using two parameter Weibull distribution. The shape and scale parameters of Weibull distribution function was evaluated using seven numerical methods namely, Graphical method (GM), Least-Squares (LS) regression of Y on X, Least-Squares (LS) regression of X on Y, Empherical Method of Lysen (EML), Mean Standard Deviation Method (MSDM), Energy Pattern Factor Method (EPFM) and Method of Moments (MOM). The average of Weibull parameters was used to incorporate survival probability into stress (S)-fatigue life (N) relationships. Based on the Weibull theory, as single and double logarithm fatigue equations for RCA and NA under different survival probability were provided. The results revealed that, by considering 0.9 level survival probability, the theoretical stress level corresponding to a fatigue failure number equal to one million cycle, decreases by 8.77% (calculated using single-logarithm fatigue equation) and 6.62% (calculated using double logarithm fatigue equation) in RCA when compared to NA concrete.

abstract={The dynamic response of a bladed disk is very sensitive to the symmetry of identical blades. If the properties of one or more blades vary slightly then the response can increase substantially, which is known as mistuning. Mistuning in bladed disks due to manufacturing tolerances has been extensively studied, with emphasis on response and fatigue life prediction. Damage to blades can also cause mistuning but has received only limited attention. The identification of mistuning in rotating bladed disks is a challenging and an on-going topic of investigation. This study proposes a Wavelet Energy-Based Mistuning Index (WEBMI) which is obtained from the wavelet packet transforms of both tuned and mistuned blade responses, and requires only output response signals. The proposed mistuning index is demonstrated on a lumped parameter model of a bladed disk, and mistuning was represented by altering the stiffness or mass of individual blades. Mistuning to single and multiple blades with different locations and severities was simulated. Gaussian white noise was added to the response signal to test robustness. Finally, experiments were conducted to validate the feasibility of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that the WEBMI is sensitive enough to identify subtle mistuning as small as 0.5% in single and multiple locations. Furthermore, the mistuning index increases monotonically with increases in mistuning severity. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria.},

abstract={Silicon heterojunction solar cells enable high conversion efficiencies, thanks to their passivating contacts which consist of layered stacks of intrinsic and doped amorphous silicon. However, such contacts may reduce the photo current, when present on the illuminated side of the cell. This motivates the search for wider bandgap contacting materials, such as metal oxides. In this paper, we elucidate the precise impact of the material parameters of MoO x on device characteristics, based on numerical simulations. The simulation results allow us to propose design principles for hole-collecting induced junctions. We find that if MoO x has a sufficiently high electron affinity (5.7 eV), direct band-To-band tunneling is the dominant transport mechanism; whereas if it has a lower electron affinity (&lt; 5.7 eV), trap-Assisted tunneling dominates, which might introduce additional series resistance. At even lower electron affinity, S-shaped J-V curves may appear for these solar cells, which are found to be due to an insufficient trap state density in the MoO x film in contrast to the expectation of better performance at low trap density. These traps may assist carrier transport when present near the conduction band edge of the MoO x film. Our simulations predict that performance optimization for the MoO x film has to target either 1) a high electron affinity and a moderate doping density film or, 2) if the electron affinity is lower than the optimum value, a high defect density not exceeding the doping density inside the film. © 2011-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Secure multicast routing is an important in mobile healthcare system. Few research works have been developed to prevent malicious behaviors from disclosing integrity of data in mobile healthcare systems using machine learning technique. But, the performance of conventional machine learning technique was not effectual. In order to overcome this limitation, Tiger hashing based AdaBoost with SVM classifier (TH-ASVMC) technique is proposed. The TH-ASVMC technique is designed to improve the security of multicast routing in MANETs with higher data integrity rate and therefore reducing the time taken. The TH-ASVMC technique initially used Tiger hash function which converts the patient data to be transmitted over a wireless network into a hash value for maintaining the data integrity during the process of multicasting in mobile healthcare system. After that, TH-ASVMC technique used AdaBoost with SVM classifier to classify the nodes in mobile healthcare system as authentic or unauthentic based on measurement of trust value for securing multicast routing with minimum communication overhead. Thus, TH-ASVMC technique choose the only an authentic node for routing the hash value of patient data to multiple destination nodes in mobile healthcare system. This process results in enhanced reliability and scalability of secured multicast routing. The TH-ASVMC technique conducts the simulations works on metrics such as data integrity rate, scalability, reliability and communication overhead. The simulation results shows that the TH-ASVMC technique is able to improve the reliability and data integrity rate of multicast routing as compared to state-of-the-art works. © 2018 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature},

abstract={Circuit partitioning is the first and the most important step in the designing of VLSI circuits. Owing to the rapidly increasing size of the designs, partitioning tools are becoming more important for the future. The partitioning algorithms are of two types, namely, constructive algorithms and iterative algorithms. In constructive algorithms, partition sets are formed with the help of algorithms; whereas, in case of iterative algorithms, new improved partition sets are formed at each iteration stepwith the modified netlist. A variety of heuristic algorithms have been developed to solve the problem of mincut which is NP-complete. With the main objective of minimizing the cutsize, numerous algorithms have been proposed for circuit partition which includes genetic and evolutionary algorithms, probability-based algorithms, clustering algorithms, and nature-based heuristics. The main intention of this paper is to provide a concise review of the VLSI CAD algorithms adopted for designing VLSI circuits. From the numerous partitioning methods available in the literature, a subjective selection has been made. © TJPRC Pvt. Ltd.},

abstract={The rapid increase in the number of vehicles has given rise to the traffic jam, which is a major problem these days. The effect of traffic jam also effects the operation of ambulance. To avoid the traffic jam for the ambulance, a new idea is developed. In this paper we propose a new concept to avoid traffic jam for the ambulance and thus saving the life of an individual. At first the ambulance is detected and the information about the arrival of the ambulance is sent to the next station. The ambulance will make siren only when it carries patient inside, so by detecting both the ambulance siren and the image taken from the acquisition device, the information is sent to the next point which is on the way to hospital. Announcement of the arrival of the ambulance is done. The CCTV camera is monitoring each vehicle on that road. If any vehicle doesn’t abide by the announcement done, the image of the vehicle will be captured, and then by using the acquired image the number plate will be tracked and will be detected automatically by image processing. The vehicle information is sent to the police station, to take the necessary action. Thus the traffic control can be done and the way is cleared for the ambulance and life is saved. The processing is done using MATLAB and is verified. © 2018 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature},

Correlation study between micro hardness, microstructure and cooling rate for Constant Current TIG welding and Activated TIG welding on Al-SiC composite are also carried out to analyze the relation between the effect of cooling rate on microstructure &amp; the effect of microstructure on micro hardness. The experimental results of ATIG welding on Al-SiC composite shows fine grain weld microstructure on ATIG - SiO2 &amp; ATIG - TiO2, which results in higher micro hardness. Micro hardness values are taken in different locations of weld surface at 1mm, 2mm &amp; 3mm below the weld surface and the same is also observed along the weld zone to heat affected zone upto 12mm for the center of the weldment. Minimum micro hardness values found in ATIG - MnO2, ATIG - CaO &amp; ATIG - MgO are due to intermediate micro structure between coarse and fine in heat affected zone. ATIG - Al2O3 weld zone &amp; heat affected zone and heat affected zone of ATIG - MnO2, ATIG - CaO &amp; ATIG - MgO shows coarse microstructure leading to reduction in micro hardness value. Cooling rate for the different CCTIG &amp; ATIG welding are recorded and correlation between the micro structures are studied. Coarse micro structure in weld zone and heat affected zone have least cooling rate whereas fine micro structure in weld zone resulted at higher cooling rate. Heat affected zone strongly depends on temperature gradient between the weld center and weldment's heat affected zone. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.},

abstract={Precluding the progression of metastasis with early diagnosis of triple-negative breast cancer remains challenging due to lack of targeting specificity with poor diagnostic potential. Herein, an amphipathic chitosan-based targeted nanomicellar theranostics (30-45 nm) comprising doxorubicin-superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles complexes (89.23%) with lower critical micelle concentration (0.1 μg/mL) were developed. Micelles exhibit concentration-based contrast enhancement in MRI (r2 6.27 mM-1 s-1) and hyperthermia rather than thermal-ablation. This theranostics delivers doxorubicin under alternating magnetic field (480 kHz) and at endosomal pH (pH 5.2) while showing stability at pH 7.4. Anti-αvβ3 integrin antibody conjugation onto PEGylated micelles (62.3%) enhances micellar internalization into drug-resistant MDA-MB-231 after 1 h and magnetizes the cells after 6 h over that with nonconjugated micelles. Immigration of MDA-MB-231 and 4T1 cells retards after 24 h, while significant reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential is observed under hyperthermia.

abstract={Mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is a self organized structure of mobile nodes which are distributed unevenly in the environment. There are various MANET routing protocols exist which cannot stand against the security issues which might occur inside or outside of the MANET environment. Black hole attack is most popular insider attack happening on the MANET environment which needs to be concerned more to avoid the unwanted packet loss. These problems are resolved in the proposed research method by introducing new method namely hybridization of particle swarm optimization with genetic algorithm (HPSO-GA) routing system. The main contribution of this research method is to detect the black hole attack (BHA) by utilizing ad hoc on demand distance vector (AODV) routing protocol. This method utilizes the data routing information (DRI) of the neighbouring nodes instead of considering source node information. DRI information are gathered from every neighbouring nodes which increases the probability of attack detection accuracy. The suggested HPSO-GA routing mechanism researches the black hole attack in MANET, at that point, the outputs were measured utilizing the parameters namely detection rate, false positive alarm (FPA), packet delivery ratio (PDR), routing overhead, average end to end delay and throughput. The outcomes are contrasted with existing techniques, like, AODV, local intrusion detection (LID) with AODV. Simulation output utilizing the network simulator demonstrates that the improvement ratio of the throughput picked up by HPSO-GA security routing mechanism and general improvement reduction at end-to-end delay and routing overhead. © 2018 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature},

abstract={Nowadays, the world is facing critical problem of energy deficit, global warming, and deterioration of the environment. Under the current scenario, the biogas energy source is the most challenging one to cope up with the scarcity of energy. Biogas is a renewable energy source which can be obtained by fermentation of organic matter also known as biomass. The biomass includes livestock waste (cow dung, manure, and uneaten food), food waste, and residues from meat, fish and dairy processing. The present study is to explore the potential of biogas production from cow dung and its usage through compressed form in a cylinder. This stored biogas can be put in use to the extent where it is required and it also reduces transportation costs, which is a major hurdle in the biogas usage.

abstract={Secure transmission of medical information occupies a crucial role in the world of telemedicine applications. Reconfigurable hardware implementation offers several advantages over software implementation especially for real time security applications. This work aims to propose the novel implementation of a penta-layer medical image encryption using a reconfigurable Cyclone II Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) EP2C35F672C6. The first layer of encryption performs the row-wise and column-wise pixel permutations based on Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR). The second and third layers of encryption are based on maximal length sequence Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG) 16-bit Cellular automata (CA) circuit and Galois Field (GF) product. In the fourth layer, a synthetic image is subsequently created by chaotic clock with Phase Lock Loop (PLLs) and gates to diffuse the image pixels. This creation of synthetic image for diffusion makes the developed cryptosystem totally hardware dependent. Last layer performs the diffusion using one dimensional logistic map. The synthesized result reveals that the reconfigurable implementation of proposed encryption process consumes comparatively lesser logic elements (2480) and low power consumption (278.65 mW) with an encryption time of 215.92 ms for encrypting a 256 × 256 DICOM medical image. Finally, various analyses such as Number of Pixel Change Rate (NPCR), Unified Average Change in Intensity (UACI), Entropy, Correlation, Uniform distribution and NIST statistical test suite have been performed to prove the robustness of the algorithm against various attacks. © 2018 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature},

abstract={Solar photovoltaic panels are prominently integrated into electric vehicle rooftop to charge the battery bank. In this paper, the performance of the conventional solar power source architecture employed in electric vehicles is analyzed using PVsyst real-time simulator. The limitations with solar photovoltaic panels and conventional solar power source are addressed through a novel mirror photovoltaic glass and split power solar source architecture. The design, manufacturing and structural merits of split power solar source are presented. The operational behavior of split power solar source is validated using Matlab. The performance of the mirror photovoltaic glass is analyzed at standard test conditions and various combinations of irradiation and temperatures using climate chamber solar simulator. The performance of mirror photovoltaic glass at on-site conditions is analyzed by comparing with climate chamber solar simulator results. Further, the analysis is validated through a convection analysis carried out using ANSYS. Subsequently, the performance of the split power solar source is studied using PVsyst real-time simulator. The split power source architecture is obtained as the best feasible solar power source design for an electric vehicle in terms of material requirement, replacement cost, withstanding capability, space utilization, power loss, tracking mechanism feasibility and performance through the comparative study. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In this paper the torsional vibration of size-dependent viscoelastic nanorods embedded in an elastic medium with different boundary conditions is investigated. The novelty of this study consists of combining the nonlocal theory with the strain and velocity gradient theory to capture both softening and stiffening size-dependent behavior of the nanorods. The viscoelastic behavior is modeled using the so-called Kelvin–Voigt viscoelastic damping model. Three length-scale parameters are incorporated in this newly combined theory, namely, a nonlocal, a strain gradient, and a velocity gradient parameter. The governing equation of motion and its boundary conditions for the vibration analysis of nanorods are derived by employing Hamilton's principle. It is shown that the expressions of the classical stress and the stress gradient resultants are only defined for different values of the nonlocal and strain gradient parameters. The case where these are equal may seem to result in an inconsistency to the general equation of motion and the related non-classical boundary conditions. A rigorous investigation is conducted to prove that the proposed solution is consistent with physics. Damped eigenvalue solutions are obtained both analytically and numerically using a Locally adaptive Differential Quadrature Method (LaDQM). Analytical results of linear free vibration response are obtained for various length-scales and compared with LaDQM numerical results. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The formation of host-guest between piperine and cucurbit[n]uril (n=6,7) molecules were studied using experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The host-guest complexation was monitored using UV-Visible and isothermal calorimetric (ITC) methods. The obtained Jobs plot indicate the formation of 1:1 complex. ITC analysis shows a moderate binding of the guest to the host molecules. The enthalpy of binding and the free energy of formation were negative indicating the facile formation of inclusion complex at room temperature. DFT studies confirm the formation of stable inclusion complexes. In stable inclusion complex of piperine with cucurbit[6]uril, the aromatic moiety was found to be inside the cucurbituril cavity, while in the cucurbit[7]uril inclusion complex, the piperidine moiety was inside the cavity, which was further confirmed by time dependent-DFT study. The global reactivity descriptors analysis, indicate the formation of piperine inclusion complex with cucurbit[7]uril, could prevent the isomerization reaction of piperine. Atoms-in-molecules analysis shows the presence of extra inter and intramolecular bond critical points in the piperine inclusion complex with cucurbit[7]uril, which accounts for its extra stability. The computed intermolecular bond parameters confirm the existence of a non-covalent with partial electrostatic interactions between the guest and host molecules. Energy decomposition analysis, suggest the Pauli repulsion to be higher for the cucurbit[6]uril inclusion complex, while the dispersion plays a major role in stabilizing the cucurbit[7]uril inclusion complex, which was further corroborated by noncovalent index analysis. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The electronic properties of bare stanene nanotube and the adsorption properties of TMA and n-BA molecules are studied using density functional theory with non-equilibrium Green's function. Moreover, the device density of states shows the shift in the peak maxima upon adsorption of TMA and n-BA molecules on to the stanene nanotube. The variation in the flow of electron is noticed upon adsorption of TMA and n-BA molecules in the transmission spectrum of stanene nanotube. I-V characteristics clearly confirm the variation in the current upon adsorption of TMA and n-BA molecules.

abstract={Message security is most imperative in mobile ad hoc networks because of the applications in circumstances such as, disaster rescue, crisis management and military. Yet, due to the absence of a fixed framework and no centralized administration implementation of security is a testing prospect. Also certain attention must be paid to energy utilization constraints while designing a security mechanism for a mobile ad hoc network. This paper presents a method which considers aforementioned constraints and suggests a non-interactive light weight symmetric key cryptosystem using fast Fourier transform based hashing and generalised symbol table based polyalphabetic substitution. The key computation and secure hashing mechanism strengthen the proposed technique and is proved to be resilient enough against the non-legitimate users with less overhead to participating nodes. The analysis on the proposed technique is performed on various sets of data with different sized network to comprehend the level of security achieved. © 2018 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature},

abstract={The advancement in technology had led to the requirement for a single image with high spatial and good spectral resolution in various applications such as remote sensing, surveillance and medical diagnosis. Most of the technology and equipment available has already reached the level of saturation in providing such convincing image or data. Image fusion techniques allow the integration of different information sources. From a pair of hyper-spectral image with low spatial and a pan image with high spatial resolutions, the aim is to synthesize a single image with highest spatial resolution and spectral content. However, apart from the standard image fusion techniques, in this paper we propose multi-sensor image fusion using empirical wavelet transform. In this image fusion scheme, the empirical wavelet transforms of the input images are appropriately combined, and the new image is obtained by taking the inverse empirical wavelet transform of the fused wavelet coefficients. With the necessity of multi-sensor data in many fields such as remote sensing, medical imaging, machine vision, military applications, sensor fusion has emerged as an upcoming and promising research area. The main objective of image fusion is to reconstruct new images that are more convincing for human visual perception, highly suitable for object detection and target recognition. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={The present research work embraces the experimental studies on mechanical and metallurgical properties of powder metallurgy (P/M) plain carbon steel (Fe-0.5 %C) welded autogenously with various modes of current, namely, alternate current, direct current, mixed mode current, and pulse current (PC) using autogenous Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG) welding. The sintered specimens of rectangular shape synthesized through the P/M route were densified by cold upsetting to obtain maximum density. A pair of specimens were welded, and the weld quality was checked by standard nondestructive testing methods. Various mechanical tests were conducted using standard size specimens as per the ASTM standards. It is found from the results of various mechanical tests that the welded joint made by PC TIG welding exhibits the greatest tensile and impact strengths among the other modes of welded joint. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) fractography of the tensile fractured surfaces reveal the brittle mode of fracture irrespective of the mode of welding currents, which are being used for joining the specimens. Optical microscopy, Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analyses have been carried out to investigate microstructural changes and phase transformation of chemical constituents at the welded region. The hardness at the fusion zone is found to be higher because of pore-free microstructure.},

abstract={A fuzzy set is a set containing elements that have a varying degree of membership in the set. In this paper, we are developing a fuzzy classifier model for demonetization impact in a specific region of south India using Max-Min fuzzy similarity method. A procedure is created to classify the regions according to the equivalence relation of fuzzy set theory. The obtained experimental results are encouraging to derive a like-minded people among the region. In this model, our classifier model describes the probability of inconvenience due to the withdrawal of money limit and the type of family such as rich, middle and poor class people suffered. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={A systematic method is proposed for providing secure image transmission from a system to a web server using Raspberry Pi. The original image to be communicated is simultaneously scrambled and encrypted using chaotic transformation. The entropy value of the encrypted image is enhanced by using an additional diffusion key along with encryption process. The encrypted image is transmitted directly from the hardware to a web server and can be remotely accessed from any other system. Though hardware implementation is more challenging to be achieved than numerical simulations, this method is implemented and successfully tested for efficient encryption parameters using advanced Raspberry Pi3 environment. The experimental results validate the reliability of the proposed method and also make it suitable for real-time secure environments. © IAEME Publication.},

abstract={The present study evaluates the potential of hesperidin-copper complex for sensing superoxide anions, which is an important marker for the diagnosis of oxidative stress-based disorders. The metal ion center present in the complex scavenges the superoxide, which can be detected through electrochemical method. The hesperidin-copper complex was successfully synthesized employing a simple room temperature method and characterized. The cyclic voltammograms recorded using a working electrode modified with hesperidin-copper complex show a reduction peak at − 0.175 V, which can be attributed to the electron transfer involving the copper center present in the complex. The sensing study using amperometric techniques in the presence of different concentrations of superoxide anions reveals that hesperidin-copper complex-coated working electrode exhibits good sensitivity and linearity. The limit of detection (LOD) for this enzyme-less sensor is 0.547 μM and limit of quantification (LOQ) is 1.65 μM. The response time was less than 2 s. This sensor was also not affected by common interferents. The sensor performance was assessed in vitro for the quantification of reactive oxygen species in macrophages under stimulated and unstimulated conditions. The results demonstrate that this sensor can be employed for clinical applications involving diagnosis of inflammatory conditions. © 2018 Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature},

abstract={The electronic properties and structural stability of zigzag graphyne nanosheet is investigated with density functional theory (DFT) technique. The structural stability of graphyne nanosheet is described using cohesive energy and phonon band structure. The interaction behavior of methanol and ethanol vapors on graphyne nanosheet is also studied using DFT method. The density-of-states (DOS) spectrum provides the perception on charge transfer upon the interaction of methanol/ethanol vapors on graphyne nanosheet. The adsorption energy of alcohol molecules on to graphyne nanosheet is noticed to be in the order of −0.167 to −0.532 eV. The band gap varies upon interaction of methanol and ethanol molecules on graphyne nanosheet, which varies in the range of 0.253–0.512 eV. The interaction of methanol/ethanol is investigated in terms of Bader charge analysis, adsorption energy, average-energy-gap variation and energy band gap. A shorter recovery time in the range of millisecond to nanosecond is observed upon desorption of alcohol molecules from graphyne nanosensor. The interaction of ethanol molecules on graphyne nanosheet is noticed to be more favorable rather than methanol vapors. The findings of the proposed work suggest the possible application of graphyne nanosheet for the detection of alcohol vapors. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This work focuses on the joining aluminium alloys (AA-2014 T651) using friction stir welding technique resulting in better mechanical properties within a chosen window of parameters. Experiments were conducted by varying rotational speed (355 rpm, 450 rpm, and 710 rpm), transverse speed (31.5 mm/min, 63 mm/min, 125 mm/min) and tool tilt (0°, 1°, 2°) at three different values. This work presents an approach based on Taguchi technique to establish the optimum conditions resulting in higher weld strengths of the AA-2014 T651 alloy weld joints, within a chosen window of parameters. The optimal parameters were found to be 355 rpm tool rotation speed, 31.5 mm/min traverse speed and a tool tilt of 2°, which resulted in 327.73 MPa tensile strength. From the analysis of variance (ANOVA) it was found that the influence of traverse speed on the tensile strength was 46.6%, while the influence of tool tilt and tool rotation speed were 33.1 % and 18.1 % respectively. Pareto analysis for the combination of parameters have shown more influence on the tensile strength by the traverse speed and tool tilt than that of other combinations. A regression model of the above process along with a regression fit equation was developed for the tensile strength of friction stir welded AA-2014 T651 alloy plates. © School of Engineering, Taylor’s University.},

Energy-dispersion spectroscopy confirms the presence of oxygen, iron and cadmium in cadmium ferrites film. The prepared CdFe2O4 thin film is extremely sensitive towards toxic benzene vapor molecules at ambient temperature. The resistance of synthesized CdFe2O4 thin film decreases considerably when this material is exposed to benzene vapor molecules.

abstract={Some of the engineering applications warrant the solution of Graph Coloring Problem, an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. This paper focuses on designing three new evolutionary operators using Tabu searching which are expected to offset the problems in the existing well-known methods in minimal search space and generations, besides maximizing the percentage of successful runs through effectively distributing promising genes for achieving fast stochastic convergence with smaller population size N. In the first method, Single Parent Conflict Gene Extended Crossover and Conflict Gene Mutation with Advanced Local Guided Search operators are designed and employed. These operators have been processed with Conflict Gene Removal constraints in the second method to minimize the search space and to increase the percentage of successful runs of the genetic algorithm. Multipoint Single Parent Conflict Gene Crossover and Multipoint Conflict Gene Mutation with Advanced Local Guided Search operators are employed along with a Conflict Gene Removal constraint in the third method. It has been exhibited that these operators reduce the search space by minimizing g¯ to obtain a better near optimal solution. The solution for most of the small and large benchmark graphs has been obtained through multipoint crossover and mutation with reduced g¯ whose value lies in a specific interval represented using maximum and minimum degrees of G. Our methods reduce the bound for the minimum colors obtained so far for certain families of graphs using smaller population size. © 2017, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals.},

abstract={Plant secondary metabolites are widely used in human disease treatment; though primary metabolism provides precursors for secondary metabolism, not much has been studied to unravel the link connecting both the processes. Most common form of gene regulation interconnecting diverse metabolism occurs at the transcriptional and/or posttranscriptional level mediated by regulatory cis-elements. The present study aims at understanding the common cis-elements network connecting the major primary metabolic enzyme, cell wall invertase (CWIN) and secondary metabolism genes in Nicotiana benthamiana (N. benthamiana). The CWIN and thirty one other gene sequences were extracted from N. benthamiana genome, followed by cis-element analysis of their 5′ upstream and 3′ downstream region using different programs (Genomatix software suite; PLACE and PlantCARe). Comparative cis-element analysis of CWIN (N. benthamiana and other plant species) and other primary, secondary metabolism and transcription factor genes (N. benthamiana) revealed the occurrence of common stress associated cis-elements. Predominantly, AHBP, L1BX, MYBL, MADS, MYBS, GTBX, DOFF and CCAF were found in the 5′ upstream region of all genes, whereas AHBP, MYBL, L1BX, HEAT, CCAF and KAN1 were largely occurring in the 3′ downstream region of all genes; indicating common function of these elements in transcriptional and posttranscriptional gene regulation. Further, genomic analysis using FGENESH, GenScan and homology based methods (BlastX and BlastN) was performed on the N. benthamiana contigs harboring CWIN and PAL, in an attempt to identify genomic neighborhood genes. The 5′ upstream and 3′ downstream region of genes in the genomic neighborhood of CWIN and PAL were also subjected to similar cis-element analysis, and the results indicated cis-elements profile similar to CWIN, PAL and other primary, secondary metabolism and transcription factor genes. The results of evolutionary studies confirmed that the 5′ upstream region of NbCWINs significantly showed more proximity to secondary metabolism genes 4CL and the redox gene SOD, followed by the phenylpropanoid pathway gene CHI. The 3′ downstream regions of NbCWINs were more closely related to other plant CWINs, followed by the redox gene, SOD and primary metabolism gene FBA. Thus, the commonly found stress responsive cis-elements in our study can play a vital role in modulating key pathways of both primary and secondary metabolism; thereby postulating their role in regulating plant growth and metabolisms under unfavourable growth conditions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The scintillating technological advancements have redefined the process of communication around the world. Banking, purchases, investments, emails, bill payments, etc. are being managed through online communications and needless to mention the linkage of these internet serves with embedded gadgets. A microcontroller being the low-cost solutions for real-time embedded applications has to handle rigid security algorithms for information security paradigm. The high level of sensitivity in chaos-based systems is highly suitable for the design of encryption schemes due to the randomness offered by them. The minimal memory resource and speed are the factors restricting the use of microcontrollers for implementing chaotic schemes that encrypt image data. This paper presents the design of a chaos-based image encryption algorithm with lightweight properties and its optimised implementation on a 32-bit microcontroller. This work also includes parameters related to the analysis of the security level and performance of the microcontroller that was missed to concentrate by the authors on their similar schemes reported in the literature. The level of safety of the proposed algorithm has been analysed via key sensitivity analysis, encryption quality analysis, randomness analysis, differential analysis, statistical analysis, visual analysis and attack analysis. Additionally, the results of performance analysis regarding smaller memory footprint and better throughput of proposed algorithm guarantee its suitability for real-time embedded applications. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In this study, biodiesel was synthesized in an enzymatic transesterification process from Hevea brasiliensis, crude non-edible oil, using lipase immobilized on spherical silica aerogels. Enzymatic transesterification is preferred to chemical methods as it is milder and is more environmentally friendly. Lipase based transesterification of Hevea brasiliensis under optimal conditions provided high FAME (fatty acid methyl esters) yields up to 93%. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the process for maximum FAME yield. The maximum yield was obtained at a temperature of 35 °C, water content of 15% (v/v %) and methanol/oil molar ratio of 8:1. Percent yields of FAME from the transesterification process followed second order model. Even after 10 cycles of reuse, lipase immobilized on spherical silica aerogel showed only 10.7% reduction in percentage yield of FAME. The results from this study demonstrate the viability of economical biodiesel production using waste products as both source and catalyst. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={As technology, processes scale up, and design complexities grow, system-on-chip integration continues to rise rapidly. According to these trends, increasing test data volume is one of the largest challenges in the testing industry. In this work, we present a new test data compression method based on a stored set called Lingering Component Reduction (LCR) Code. The test set contains a large number of don't- care that can be exploited to improve the experimental data compression. In this method, a reference pattern is organized, and an adaptability of input pattern with reference pattern is reduced. The Lingering Component estimation based on test pattern contains more don't-care conditions that can be actively reduced to improve the test data compression on the Intellectual Property cores. The simulation results show the performance of experimental data compression ratio and testing time parameters. From the analysis of simulation results, it is proved that the proposed LCR code enhances a compression ratio and reduce the test time follows the International Symposium on Circuits and Systems’89.

abstract={Serine protease inhibitors, inhibit serine proteases either partially or completely after forming complexes with their respective proteases. Protease actions are significant for many physiological pathways found in living forms and any anomalies may lead to numerous physiological complications. Each cell or organism has its own mechanism for controlling these protease actions. It is often regulated by the action of inhibitors or activators. Among the proteases, serine proteases are the most common that are involved in many life and death processes. Selective inhibitors of physiologically relevant proteases can be used as a lead compound for the drug development. Therefore, it is imperative to identify small peptides and proteins that selectively inhibit serine proteases from various sources. Microbes can be considered as a major source of diverse serine protease inhibitors since they have the prominent and diverse domain in nature. Most of the microbial serine protease inhibitors are intracellular and few are extracellular. Microbes produce protease inhibitors for protection against its own proteases or against other environmental factors. The status and future prospects of microbial serine protease inhibitors and their therapeutic benefits in treating cancer, blood coagulation disorders and viral infections, are reviewed here. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

This paper presents the results of an experimental impact test conducted using drop weight hammer on fibre reinforced concrete (FRC) with 0.32 and 0.40 water/binder ratio made with binary and quaternary composite lime sludge cements. For this purpose, 34 concrete mixes containing hooked end steel fibres with aspect ratios of 50 at dosage of 0.5%, 1.0% and 1.5% were prepared with binary and quaternary cementitious systems. The binary systems were designed with various proportions of lime sludge ranging from 5%, 10% and 15%, while the quaternary systems were designed with various proportions of lime sludge combined with 15% of flyash and 10% of silica fume as partial substitute of cement. Further, a six regression models were constructed and validated for the assessment of effectiveness in determining the impact energy at first crack and failure. The results depict that replacement of 10% lime sludge in quaternary cementitious systems with this proportion is very effective in increasing the compressive strength and impact strength in concrete. © 2018 Structural Engineering Research Centre.

abstract={Aims: To enhance the antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity of norfloxacin against the planktonic and biofilm mode of growth in ESKAPE pathogens using chemically modified norfloxacin salts. Methods and Results: Antimicrobial testing, synergy testing and time-kill curve analysis were performed to evaluate antibacterial effect of norfloxacin carboxylic acid salts against ESKAPE pathogens. In vivo efficacy to reduce bacterial bioburden was evaluated in zebrafish infection model. Crystal violet assay and live–dead staining were performed to discern antibiofilm effect. Membrane permeability, integrity and molecular docking studies were carried out to ascertain the mechanism of action. The carboxylic acid salts, relative to parent molecule norfloxacin, displayed two- to fourfold reduction in minimum inhibitory concentration against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in addition to displaying potent bacteriostatic effect against certain members of ESKAPE pathogens. In vivo treatments revealed that norfloxacin tartrate (SRIN2) reduced MRSA bioburden by greater than 1 log fold relative to parent molecule in the muscle tissue. In silico docking with gyrA of S. aureus showed increased affinity of SRIN2 towards DNA gyrase. The enhanced antibacterial effect of norfloxacin salts could be partially accounted by altered membrane permeability in S. aureus and perturbed membrane integrity in P. aeruginosa. Antibiofilm studies revealed that SRIN2 (norfloxacin tartrate) and SRIN3 (norfloxacin benzoate) exerted potent antibiofilm effect particularly against Gram-negative ESKAPE pathogens. The impaired colonization of both S. aureus and P. aeruginosa due to improved norfloxacin salts was further supported by live–dead imaging. Conclusion: Norfloxacin carboxylic acid salts can act as potential alternatives in terms of drug resensitization and reuse. Significance and Impact of the Study: Our study shows that carboxylic acid salts of norfloxacin could be effectively employed to treat both planktonic- and biofilm-based infections caused by select members of ESKAPE pathogens. © 2017 The Society for Applied Microbiology},

abstract={Ornithine Decarboxylase (ODC) is a key enzyme involved in polyamine synthesis and is reported to be up regulated in several cancers. However, the effect of ODC gene silencing in retinoblastoma is to be understood for utilization in therapeutic applications. Hence, in this study, a novel siRNA (small interference RNA) targeting ODC was designed and validated in Human Y79 retinoblastoma cells for its effects on intracellular polyamine levels, Matrix Metalloproteinase 2 & 9 activity and Cell cycle. The designed siRNA showed efficient silencing of ODC mRNA expression and protein levels in Y79 cells. It also showed significant reduction of intracellular polyamine levels and altered levels of oncogenic LIN28b expression. By this study, a regulatory loop is proposed, wherein, ODC silencing in Y79 cells to result in decreased polyamine levels, thereby, leading to altered protein levels of Lin28b, MMP-2 and MMP-9, which falls in line with earlier studies in neuroblastoma. Thus, by this study, we propose ODC silencing as a prospective strategy for targeting retinoblastoma. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS},

abstract={Vaginitis is a common infection caused by bacteria and fungi leading to inflammation, itching and redness in the vaginal mucosal region, which can be treated by antibacterial and antifungal drug therapy. The current work is focused on development of aerosol foam formulation of an in situ gel for treatment of vaginitis. For this purpose, in situ gel formulations were prepared using carbopol 940, carrageenan and cellulose polymers at different composition and converted to foam spray using sodium lauryl sulphate as foaming agent. The prepared formulations were evaluated for standard quality parameters and the results confirmed the significance of the optimized formulation to deliver the drug in vaginal region and provide sustained release for 8 h. Based on the results obtained, it was evident that the in situ gel formulations comprising of 0.45% of carbopol 940 with 0.35% HPMC K4M and the 0.35% of carbopol 940 with 0.35% HPC were optimum for gelation process. These formulations also released less than 50% of drug in simulated vaginal fluid at the end of 8 h. In conclusion, optimization of polymer concentration for the in vivo gelation process would be the efficient way to develop stable vaginal drug delivery systems. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In Horizontal Axis Wind Turbines (HAWT), the interference between the wind turbine rotor blade and the tower is a pervasive problem that affects the tower as well as blades, structures, and power performances; hence, the study of the physical mechanism needs engineering attention. This interference phenomenon influences the flow field and excites the complex unsteady wind loads acting on the tower. Towers of the wind turbines have the potential geometry such as lattice, tubular, hybrid but this study focuses on cylindrical towers. The Wind tunnel experiment is carried out on scaled down three bladed wind turbine model with S809 aerofoil section blade to investigate the flow physics for tower alone and tower with rotating rotor for the Reynolds number ranging from 102 to 104. The aerodynamic drag force acting on the wind turbine tower with the rotating rotor is in increasing trend than the single tower without interference, which is almost constant. The results show that at low Reynolds number the coefficient of drag on the tower alone is more than the tower with rotating rotor whereas this case reverses as the Reynolds number increases. The drag force acting on the tower under the blade rotation effect has been investigated, and an aerodynamic term (Drag ratio) is proposed, which will be helpful for guiding the structural designer of the wind turbines. © 2018, Chinese Mechanical Engineering Society.

abstract={Abstract: The crystallographic study of 2,2’-((4-bromophenyl)methylene)bis(3-hydroxy-5,5-dimethylcyclohex-2-en-1-one) reveals that the compound crystallizes in the centrosymmetric space group P2 1/ c. In the solid state, the structure of the title compound exhibits two strong intramolecular O-H⋯O hydrogen bonding interactions. Further, molecules of the title compound are self-assembled by weak intermolecular C - H ⋯ O , π⋯ π and H⋯H and C-H⋯Br contacts. Various intermolecular interaction that exist in the crystal structure and their energetics are quantified using PIXEL, DFT and QTAIM analyses. Six different motifs are identified from the PIXEL calculation. Lattice energy calculation suggests that the dispersion energy has the highest contribution for the crystal formation. The relative contributions of various intermolecular contacts in the title compound and its closely related analogs are evaluated using Hirshfeld surface analysis and the decomposed fingerprint plots. The common packing features exist between the title compound and its related analogs are identified. The quantitative molecular electrostatic potential surface diagram depicts the potential binding sites which are in good agreement with the crystal structure of the title compound. The structures of title compound in gas and solvent phases are compared with the experimental structure and reveals that they are superimposed very well. The vibrational modes of the monomer and four most stabilized dimers are characterized using both the experimental and DFT calculations. The UV-Vis spectrum is calculated using time dependent-DFT (TD-DFT) method and compared with experimental spectrum. The results indicate that the calculated energy of absorbance and oscillator strength correlate well with the experimental data. Graphical Abstract: SYNOPSIS.

abstract={ZnO nanowires (NWs) were deposited on a glass substrate by the successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction method (SILAR). Sensing response of ZnO NWs towards reducing vapours was tested at ambient temperature (∼ 32 ∘C) by the chemiresistor method. The vapour response was found to be 80.2, 1.6, 1.1 and 1.1 for NH3,H2O,(CH3)2CO and C 2H 5OH , respectively. Also, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to understand the charge transfer and electronic property change during adsorption of molecules over ZnO NW. The band of the Zn 3d state was altered after adsorption and no significant changes were observed in the O 2p state. Higher binding energy (14.6 eV) with significant charge transfer (0.04 |e|) was observed in the ammonia-adsorbed ZnO NW. On comparing response obtained through experimental and computational studies, almost a similar trend of response was observed except for the H 2O –ZnO system. This was due to lack of dispersion interaction and steric effect influence in the DFT calculation with the chosen computational methods. © 2018, Indian Academy of Sciences.},

abstract={Migratory species may display striking phenotypic plasticity during individual lifetimes. This may include differential investment in body parts and functions, differential resource use and allocation, and behavioural changes between migratory and non-migratory phases. While migration-related phenotypic changes are well-reported, their underlying mechanisms are usually poorly understood. Here we compare individuals from migratory (reproductive diapause) and non-migratory (reproductive) phases of closely related aposematic butterfly species to study how sexual dimorphism and migratory behaviour underlie significant morphological tradeoffs, and propose a plausible scenario to explain the migration-related phenotypic plasticity observed in females of migratory species. We found that female butterflies invested significantly more in their abdominal mass compared to males irrespective of their migratory phase, and underwent a clear shift in their body mass allocation after the switch from the reproductive diapause phase to the reproductive phase. In reproductive phase, females invested much more in reproductive tissue. This switch occurred as a result of increased abdominal mass (i.e. reproductive tissue mass) without significant reduction in the thoracic mass (i.e. flight muscle mass). Migratory males, however, were not significantly different from non-migratory males in terms of relative investment in flight and reproductive tissues. These patterns were consistent between migratory and non-migratory aposematic species within and across clades. While migratory habits may influence the physiology and behaviour of both sexes, long-distance migration affected female morphology much more markedly compared to that of males. These results show the sex-specific nature of adaptations to migratory behaviour, and suggest that seemingly disparate life-history traits such as aposematism and migration may have similar influences on the lifetime energetic investments of insects. © 2017 The Authors},

abstract={Background &amp; objectives: Bardet–Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a genetically heterogeneous autosomal recessive disorder characterized by multiple organ defects involving retina, kidney, liver and brain. Disease-causing mutations in BBS genes narrowed down by homozygosity mapping in small consanguineous and non-consanguineous pedigrees were reported in 80 per cent of the study population. This study was aimed to screen these genes (BBS3, BBS10) and specific exons of BBS genes (BBS1, BBS5, MKKS, BBS9, BBS11 and BBS12) for recurrent mutations in a selected sample of BBS patients. Methods: The recurrent mutations in BBS genes were screened in the BBS affected individuals by PCR based direct sequencing. The pathogenicity of the observed mutations were confirmed by co-segregation analysis, screening of healthy unrelated controls and in silico analysis. Results: In the 64 BBS patients (44 males, 20 females) were studied, mutations were predominant in BBS10 and ARL6 genes; the c.272T&gt;C; p.(I91T) mutation in ARL6 gene was a recurrent mutation. One novel non-sense mutation c.425T&gt;G; p(L142*) was obtained in BBS5 gene (family BSI-31). Interpretation &amp; conclusions: BBS10 gene mutations clustered in exon 2 of the gene suggesting the exon as a probable hotspot for mutations in Indian population. A cost-and time-effective strategy for the molecular diagnosis of BBS was designed based on these results. © 2018 Indian Journal of Medical Research, published by Wolters Kluwer-Medknow for Director-General, Indian Council of Medical Research},

abstract={Purpose: The study aimed to evaluate the classroom environment of children with low vision and provide recommendations to reduce visual stress, with focus on mainstream schooling. Methods: The medical records of 110 children (5-17 years) seen in low vision clinic during 1 year period (2015) at a tertiary care center in south India were extracted. The visual function levels of children were compared to the details of their classroom environment. The study evaluated and recommended the chalkboard visual task size and viewing distance required for children with mild, moderate, and severe visual impairment (VI). Results: The major causes of low vision based on the site of abnormality and etiology were retinal (80%) and hereditary (67%) conditions, respectively, in children with mild (n = 18), moderate (n = 72), and severe (n = 20) VI. Many of the children (72%) had difficulty in viewing chalkboard and common strategies used for better visibility included copying from friends (47%) and going closer to chalkboard (42%). To view the chalkboard with reduced visual stress, a child with mild VI can be seated at a maximum distance of 4.3 m from the chalkboard, with the minimum size of visual task (height of lowercase letter writing on chalkboard) recommended to be 3 cm. For 3/60-6/60 range, the maximum viewing distance with the visual task size of 4 cm is recommended to be 85 cm to 1.7 m. Conclusion: Simple modifications of the visual task size and seating arrangements can aid children with low vision with better visibility of chalkboard and reduced visual stress to manage in mainstream schools. © 2018 Indian Journal of Ophthalmology.},

abstract={Present work is focused on the improvement of gas sensing and opto-electronic properties of cadmium oxide (CdO) thin films deposited by chemical spray pyrolysis technique, with different cobalt (Co) dopant concentrations in the final spray solution. The XRD patterns reveal that the preferential growth is shifted between (111) and (200) depending on the Co- doping concentrations. The Cd-O bond vibrations were confirmed by micro-Raman analysis. The oxidization state of metal elements was determined by XPS analysis. The FE-SEM analysis revealed the variation in surface microstructure due to the variation in Co- doping concentration in CdO thin films. The elemental composition of deposited films was estimated using EDS. The formaldehyde gas response of 0.50 wt% Co- doped CdO thin film was 23%. The electrical properties were estimated by Hall measurements in van der Pauw configuration. The 0.50 wt% Co- doped CdO thin film showed a maximum carrier mobility of about 87 cm2/Vs and a photocurrent of 2.50 nA at 42 V. The Co- doped CdO thin films showed a high optical transmittance of about 84% in the range of 600–1100 nm. The band gap varies between 2.38 eV and 2.50 eV. The estimated high figure of merit is 4.79 × 10−3 Ω−1 for 0.50 wt% of Co- doped CdO film. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Predation impacts development, behavior and morphology of prey species thereby shaping their abundances, distribution and community structure. Non-lethal threat of predation, specifically, can have a strong influence on prey lifehistory characteristics. While investigations often focus on the impact of predation threat on prey in isolation, tests of its interactive effects with food availability and resource competition on prey survival and fitness can improve understanding of costs, benefits and trade-offs of anti-predator strategies. This study, involving Aedes aegypti mosquitoes as a model organism, investigates both simple and interactive effects of predation threat during the larval stage on survival, size at and time to maturity, stored teneral reserves of glycogen, protein and lipid in adults, and adult longevity. Our results show that development times of mosquito larvae were increased (by 14.84% in males and by 97.63% in females), and size of eclosing adults decreased (by 62.30% in males and by 58.33% in females) when exposed to lowered nutrition and elevated intraspecific competition, but that predation had no detectable effect on these simple traits. Teneral reserves of glycogen, protein and lipid and adult longevity were positively correlated with adult body size. Non-lethal predation threat had significant interactive effects with nutrition and larval competition on teneral reserves in males and adult longevity in males and females. The sexes responded differently to conditions encountered as larvae, with the larval environment affecting development and adult characteristics more acutely for females than for males. The outcome of this study shows how threat of predation on juveniles can have long-lasting effects on adults that are likely to impact mosquito population dynamics and that may impact disease transmission. © This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

abstract={The response of thin slabs of Slurry-Infiltrated Fibrous Concrete (SIFCON) with and without reinforcement under low velocity impacts is explored via drop-hammer impact experiments. For comparison purpose, plain cement concrete (PCC) and reinforced cement concrete (RCC) slabs were also cast and tested. To produce SIFCON slabs made with binary cementitious materials, the pre-determined concrete mixtures were designed with 15% of silica fume, 30% of blast furnace as a partial substitute of cement along with a constant 10% of hooked end steel fibres by volume fraction. The replication of a low-velocity impact on slab was achieved by dropping a steel ball (weighing 4.5 kg), with fall height of 457 mm, via the utilization of a self-fabricated drop-hammer impact test device. The parameters like first crack and ultimate failure energy absorption capacity, ultimate crack resistance, crack resistance ratio, ductility indices, and failure pattern were examined. The test results reported that the incorporation of binary blends of silica fume and slag in SIFCON matrix shows better performance in terms of strength and durability characteristics. © 2017},

abstract={MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small, non-coding RNAs that are involved in the regulation of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. MicroRNAs play an important role in cancer cell proliferation, survival and apoptosis. Epigenetic modifiers regulate the microRNA expression. Among the epigenetic players, histone deacetylases (HDACs) function as the key regulators of microRNA expression. Epigenetic machineries such as DNA and histone modifying enzymes and various microRNAs have been identified as the important contributors in cancer initiation and progression. Recent studies have shown that developing innovative microRNA-targeting therapies might improve the human health, specifically against the disease areas of high unmet medical need. Thus microRNA based therapeutics are gaining importance for anti-cancer therapy. Studies on Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) have revealed the early relapse and poor overall survival of patients which needs immediate therapeutic attention. In this report, we focus the effect of HDAC inhibitors on TNBC cell proliferation, regulation of microRNA gene expression by a series of HDAC genes, chromatin epigenetics, epigenetic remodelling at miR-200 promoter and its modulation by various HDACs. We also discuss the need for identifying novel HDAC inhibitors for modulation of miR-200 in triple negative breast cancer. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In agriculture, despite large-scale funding and extension of irrigation services it is a serious concern that majority sectors are facing deficits in water management. Irrigation system is one of the major aspect to be enriched meeting the economic and sustainable challenges of the farmers. Recent trends in the area of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) have influenced a wide implementation of various applications in the area of precise agriculture. WSNs for environmental condition monitoring with defined knowledge are used for estimating crop growth and yield properties. The proposed system automates the irrigation and fertigation using WSN to make comparatively high yield than the traditional methods. Irrigation scheduling is estimated by use of WSN's real time monitoring of weather and soil properties. The exigent need for solving the constraints, Evapotranspiration (ET) system is integrated with irrigation module which uses Penman-Monteith FAO-56 model for calculating crop water need. The paper discusses the advantages of ICT intervention in agriculture domain. The system overcomes limitations of traditional agricultural procedures by utilizing water resource efficiently and also reducing labour cost. As a result, the proposed system helps in water conservation to a great extent and also reduces soil erosion as only the required fertilizers are injected via the drip system. The paper also includes the implementation and results of surface drip irrigation and sub-surface drip irrigation are implemented in maize and sugarcane field respectively. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Electroencephalography can be treated as an electrophysiological method that can be used to monitor the electrical activity of the brain. Having EEG signal as an aid, there are innumerable diseases that can be detected. Epilepsy is one such disease that can be easily encountered with the abnormalities in the EEG signal. Epilepsy is a condition that affects many people, rendering it the most common neurological disorder after stroke. However it is still difficult to detect some subtle but critical changes in an EEG signal. In this paper we are designing an automated system (classifier) that classifies the recorded EEG signal into Normal, Interictal and Ictal cases. The automation is achieved by extracting various features that include statistical data in the transformed domain using Wavelet and Hilbert techniques. Also the approximate entropy of the sub-bands are included. Now having known the range of the values, each of the features is given a rank. These features are used to enhance the differences between the three cases. Classifier performance is evaluated in terms of its accuracy, specificity and sensitivity. This automated classifier can classify the EEG signal into the desirable cases and has found out its way in biomedical applications by simply repudiating the conventional methods. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Increased growth of information technology in healthcare has led to a situation where the security of patient information is more important and is a critical issue. The aim of the proposed algorithm is to provide a framework to verify the integrity of the medical images. In this paper, the integrity of the medical images is verified by embedding hash signatures using the sequential square embedding technique. This technique is as efficient as the diamond encoding technique but with increased payload capability. The medical image is first divided into the region of interest (ROI) block and the signature block. The hash signatures are determined by dividing the ROI into nonoverlapping blocks. During the data hiding stage, the hash signatures are embedded in randomly chosen pixel pairs in the signature block using the sequential square encoding (SSE) technique. In the experimental results, the data hiding capacity of the proposed SSE technique is verified in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio. Also, the medical image integrity is substantiated by comparing the L2 norm between computed and extracted hash signatures. Modifications such as contrast enhancement, rotation, scaling, and changing the image information result in increased L2 norm; thus, the integrity of the medical images can be verified. The parameters required for embedding, such as the embedding parameter and the seed for random sequence generation, are encrypted and communicated to the receiving end. Hence, the proposed algorithm provides a secure framework for medical image integrity verification. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.},

abstract={Generally adopted strategies to improve capacitance of the electrode materials are tuning various properties of the electrode material or increasing the cell voltage. While tuning the properties of the electrode material is tedious, increasing the cell voltage is restricted by the stability of the electrolyte. Herein, we report a facile approach to improve the capacitance of MnCO3 by the influence of SiOx nanofluid in the electrolyte. The capacitance properties of MnCO3 are studied in 0.1 M Mg(ClO4)2 electrolyte in the presence and in the absence of SiOx nanofluid. The presence of small amount of SiOx nanofluid in the electrolyte provides higher diffusivity and more conductive percolation paths for ions and thus decreases internal resistance and increases ionic conductivity of the electrolyte. As a result, 60% enhancement in the capacitance is witnessed for MnCO3. Further, nanofluid containing electrolyte is found to be stable over a month.

abstract={The purpose of the present investigation is to formulate liposomes of Lornoxicam for topical delivery using Central Composite Design, to provide a sustained release of the drug and thereby extend its elimination half-life. Liposomes were prepared by thin film hydration method with pH induced vesiculation. The liposomes were assessed for their particle size, charge, morphology and drug entrapment and characterized using TGA-DSC and FTIR analysis, to assess the interaction between the drug and excipients. The in vitro release study was performed using modified USP dissolution apparatus-I using three different dissolution media and the ex vivo release study was performed using goat skin. The cytotoxicity of Lornoxicam liposomes were studied on NIH 3T3 cells by MTT assay. The optimized formulation with particle size ranging from 100–200 nm provided sustained release for 8 h. The characterization studies proved very less interactions between the drug and the excipients. The ex vivo studies showed flux value of 23.29 μg/cm 2 /h and K p 0.011645 cm/h. The cytotoxicity study showed increase in toxicity with increase in concentration more than 0.5 μg/mL. The in vivo skin toxicity studies and histopathology analysis showed absence of toxic lesions, which confirmed the suitability of the formulation for topical application. Lornoxicam liposomes with good skin permeation and sustained release of drug were finally optimized by the experimental design. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

In CH3CN, ortho and para-CPDP selectively produced yellow color upon addition of Al3 + and Fe3 + that was slowly disappeared. The yellow color of ortho and para-CPDP in DMF was decolourised selectively by adding Al3 + and Fe3 +. Both ortho and para-CPDP in CH3CN showed nearly similar rate of decolourization for Fe3 + and Al3 +. However, the rate of decolourization of ortho and para-CPDP in DMF was different for Fe3 + (10 μM, 8 min) and Al3 + (5 × 10− 4 M, 40 min) ions. The limit of detection of para-CPDP for Fe3 + is 10 μM and Al3 + 500 μM. The mechanistic studies revealed the imine hydrolysis of ortho and para-CPDP in presence of Lewis acidic Fe3 + and Al3 +. The reactivity based sensing lead to high selectivity for Al3 + and Fe3 + ions. Further, para-CPDP exhibited selective fluorescence turn-on for Zn2 + in DMF (λmax = 513 nm) and detection limit of 6.0 μM.

abstract={Herein we report a well-organized analysis on various key-properties of SnS thin films for solar cell fabricated by nebulizer spray pyrolysis technique. X-ray diffraction study reveals the polycrystalline nature of deposited films with orthorhombic crystal structure. The crystallite size was calculated and observed to be in the range of 8–28 nm with increasing molarity of precursor solution. The stoichiometry composition of SnS was confirmed by EDX study. SEM/AFM studies divulge the well-covered deposited surface with spherical grains and the size of grains is increasing with concentration and so the roughness. A remarkable decrease in band gap from 2.6 eV to 1.6 eV was noticed by raising the molar concentration from 0.025 M up to 0.075 M. A single strong emission peak at about 825 nm is observed in PL spectra with enhanced intensity which may be attributed to near band edge emission. From the Hall effect measurement, it was found that the SnS thin film exhibits p-type conductivity. The calculated values of resistivity and carrier concentration are 0.729 Ω cm and 3.67 × 1018/cm3 respectively. Furthermore, to study the photovoltaic properties of SnS thin films a heterojunction solar cell, FTO/n-CdS/p-SnS was produced and the conversion efficiency was recorded about 0.01%. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Nanofibers are often referred in medical, engineering and defense applications due to their unusual surface structure, which hold special significance in determining the functional properties. In this work, we report the simple spray pyrolysis strategy to deposit vanadium pentoxide (V 2 O 5 ) nanofibers on to glass substrate. A switch in the crystal structure from amorphous to polycrystalline was noticed when the precursor concentration was varied from 0.025 to 0.1 M. The size of polycrystallites was increased with precursor concentration. From scanning electron micrographs (SEM), well-defined interconnected nanofiber morphology was observed for V 2 O 5 film deposited at 0.1 M of precursor concentration. The sensing properties of V 2 O 5 film towards formaldehyde, ethanol, toluene, methanol, xylene, acetone, acetaldehyde and ammonia vapours were observed.

abstract={Experimental investigations have revealed significant mismatches between analytical estimates and experimentally measured deflections of transmission towers. These are attributed to bolt slip and joint flexibility. This study focuses on effects of joint flexibility on tower deflections and proposes criterions for permissible deflection limits based on the stresses in joints. The objective has been framed given that guidelines are not available in the codes of practices for transmission towers with regard to the permissible limits of deflection. The analysis procedure is geometric and material nonlinear with consideration of joint flexibility in the form of extension or contraction of the cover plates. The deflections due to bolt slip are included in the study by scaling up the deflections obtained from analysis by a factor. Using the results of the analysis, deflection limits for the towers are proposed by limiting the stresses in the joints. The obtained limits are then applied to a new full scale tower to demonstrate the application of the current study. Copyright © 2018 Techno-Press, Ltd.},

abstract={Handling and ride characteristic are dependent to a large extent on the characteristic of a vehicle's suspension system. This work explores the effect of the use of conical spring in place of conventional cylindrical profiled helical spring design in the handling of a bus at low speeds through full vehicle multi-body simulations. The bus was modelled using standard template available in ADAMSTM software package. The vehicle inertial properties were verified against properties in literature. The conventional spring characteristic (L) from ADAMSTM database was taken as reference and compared it with a non-linear characteristic (NL) based on literature data. The planned maneuover was to execute a right turn based on standard road dimension inputs from IRC 86:1983 at a constant speed of 30 km/hour with acceleration controlled by software module. Chassis displacements, displacements of spring were tracked to understand handling and ride quality. The variation of chassis displacements showed a significant improvement in ride characteristic of vehicle with most vibrations being damped in NL at time lower than the L characteristic suspension. All through the study, lateral acceleration was well within the rollover threshold and tire interaction forces did not exhibit any significant changes. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.},

abstract={The limitation of the physically disabled affect the living quality of the person to a great extent. The impairments are of different types which are visual, auditory, mobility and cognitive. According to the causes of impairments they are classified as prenatal, postnatal and perinatal disabilities. The proposed system is fully autonomous for Indoor Navigation and semi-autonomous for Outdoor Navigation. The framework has Activation and Localization modules. The Activation module uses Voice Recognition or Remote Control to summon the chair. The method is chosen based upon the people's disability. The Localization module has varied sub modules: Obstacle detection and Obstacle avoidance. The Localization is done using 3D modelling technique or emulation of the movement of normal people. The framework incorporates a Memory Unit in ATS which reduces the computational time and the response time has a marginal change than other Tracking assistive systems. The Obstacle detection occurs with the Depth Image Sensor which records the depth of the environment using the Infrared Projection. The obstacles are avoided using the motors in wheels of EPW to turn the wheelchair for a required angle and the wheelchair proceeds in free space. The records of DIS and detected obstacle's dimensions are loaded into Cloud or local Database. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Proliferation of applications, complexity of business processes, and requirements of stronger security systems have put increasingly higher demands on Information Hiding. The increasing levels of Internet penetration has not only made communication easier, but has also increased the need for digital securities for individuals as well as enterprises. Hence, there is a need for simple and powerful techniques for improving security and watermarking that can be used by the simple user. This paper using two methods, namely splitting and randomization, proposes an efficient and novel method for information hiding and invisible watermarking of images. By splitting the image, a large number of smaller images are obtained which can be recombined in various combinations to simulate scrambling. In this paper, scrambling is achieved by randomizing the smaller images, using some random number generation algorithm, and then merged. These ideas are discussed and the case is made, through a number of examples that this simple watermarking procedure is both robust and powerful. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Human mitotic kinesins are potential anticancer drug targets because of their essential role in mitotic cell division. The kinesin Eg5 (Kinesin-5, kif11) has gained much attention in this regard and has many inhibitors in different phases of clinical trials. All drug candidates considered for Eg5 so far binds to the binding site (Site 1) formed by the loop L5, helices α2 and α3 and are uncompetitive to ATP/ADP. Recently, it has been reported that Eg5 also has a second binding site (Site 2) formed by helices α4 and α6. In the current work, we have screened the compounds in the diversity set-III from National Cancer Institute (NCI) and Zinc database to identify potential inhibitors for Eg5 that specifically binds to the site 2. The compounds were ranked based on the glide extra precision docking scores and the top ranked compounds were found to have pyridazine scaffold. The top five compounds were further evaluated for other drug like properties. Stability of protein-ligand complexes were analyzed using molecular dynamic simulations. Our studies suggest that pyridazine analogs have good MDCK, permeability properties and high binding affinity to the human Eg5. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Predation is a strong selective force that affects prey population and ecosystem dynamics. Detecting predators and associated levels of threat is crucial to prey responses. Once a predator is detected, anti-predatory responses improve the chances of survival of prey. We used Aedes aegypti larvae to study behavioural responses to predation threat from guppies (Poecilia reticulata). Specifically, we tested the relative importance of chemical cues, both in isolation and in combination with physical cues, in eliciting anti-predatory behaviours. Larvae responded more strongly, by reducing the lengths of their wriggle bursts, when presented with a combination of chemical and physical cues than with chemical cues alone. Anti-predatory responses often come with an associated cost, and we expect that the ability to pay these costs should influence responses to predation risk. To test this, we compared wriggling patterns of satiated vs starved larvae in the same experiment. We found that, under predation risk, starved larvae were willing to take more risks than satiated larvae were. We sought to experimentally test the assumption that anti-predator behaviours increase the survival of prey. To do this, starved guppies were made to choose between displays of simulated larvae, moving in short and long wriggle bursts as observed in the previous experiment. The fish preferentially attacked larvae moving in long bursts, demonstrating the survival value of the larval anti-predatory response of shifting to a preponderance of short wriggle bursts. Our study identifies specific ways in which trade-offs between predation risk and energetic costs could affect anti-predator behaviour. © 2017 Dipartimento di Biologia, Università di Firenze, Italia.},

abstract={One of the major activities in Civil Engineering project is earthmoving, which requires the need of expensive construction equipment. The optimization of earthwork results in considerable savings in term of project duration and cost of earthworks. This paper presents a framework for optimizing earthwork operation using linear programming. The study used an optimization mathematical model to minimize the cost of earthwork plan which satisfies all constraints thus improving the overall construction productivity. With this model, it is possible to determine the amount of earth to be hauled and minimum distance to transport the earth material with regard to achieve the optimization goal set by user and to meet constraints of the project. Two numerical examples of digital projects are presented to demonstrate potential savings in earthwork planning and its ability in finding near optimal solutions in an efficient manner. The results of the study indicate that Linear programming model is able to provide optimal earthwork planning optimization that significantly reduces the construction project cost. © 2018, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.

abstract={Efavirenz is an anti-HIV drug categorized under Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (NNRTI). It is recognized as the first line drug of choice for treating HIV infections. Poor aqueous solubility of the drug (< 10 µg/mL) offers specific challenges in formulation design, leading to limited bioavailability of 40 to 50%. To address this issue, several drug delivery options have been adopted for Efavirenz with special emphasis on alternative routes of administration like buccal, rectal, vaginal and transdermal. The carrier-based delivery using vesicular systems, micro/nanoparticles, hydrogels, degradable systems, etc. was also designed through solvent evaporation, spray drying, double emulsification and ionic gelation techniques. The nanotechnology-based drug delivery approaches have been demonstrated with significant improvement in the solubility and bioavailability of Efavirenz. The objective of the review is to compile and present the comprehensive report of various researches highlighted for synthesizing nanoparticles of Efavirenz using different polymeric and non-polymeric materials. We have discussed the range of materials utilized for the preparation of stable nanoparticles through the validated experimental protocol and their substantial selection of optimized formulation through significant results. © 2018 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={The emergence of non-volatile memory such as PCM (phase change memory), MRAM (magnetic memories) are considered to be promising alternatives of existing DRAM. These emerging memory technologies bring us the advantage of greater performance and non-volatility. The existing architecture with DRAM is almost free from physical attack. This is due to the reason that most of their contents erases when powered off. Despite very few complex physical attacks, the DRAM is considered safe. This volatile nature of DRAM is overridden by non-volatile memories, which result in an architecture, vulnerable to side channel attack. This paper analyses the possible side channel attacks, its intensity and possibilities to secure the non-volatile memory from such scenario.

abstract={Mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is a multi-hop connectionless network in which every node must act as a host as well as a router. Its application includes target tracking in military, natural disaster recovery, health care and Risky environment monitoring. To protect the network from security threats many protocols are available to shelter the data transmission. But they suffer from increased end to end delay and low throughput. The objective of the proposed model is to reduce the delay and increase the throughput, thereby saving energy. In this work, secure transfer of data is guaranteed by using a Time-stamp based RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)(TRSA) algorithm. The Improved Lempel–Ziv–Welch (ILZW) compression helps in increasing throughput and decrease in delay. The asymmetric encryption algorithm, in general, decreases throughput and increases delay in which the compression algorithm must counteract. Based on the simulation results it provides an efficient way to transmit data that not only provides security but also have better energy saving. © 2018, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc..

abstract={Several research works have been executed to examine the performance of slurry infiltrated fibrous concrete (SIFCON) under static and impact loading. But limited works have been done on the strength and durability characteristics of SIFCON made with binary blends of supplementary cementitious materials. The experimental investigation was carried out to study the strength and durability characteristics of slurry infiltrated fibrous concrete with partial substitution by fly ash (10, 15, 20, 25 & 30% as replacement of cement. SIFCON matrix containing a constant fibres content (10%) and water/binder = 0.4 were used throughout the entire investigations. The test results revealed that the incorporation of a blended cement with fly ash in SIFCON decreases the mechanical properties and improves the durability thus indicates the sorption coefficient decreases compared to control specimen. Regression model has been developed from the experimental results for estimating the compressive strength, split tensile strength, flexural strength and water permeability of SIFCON made with the binary cementitious blend of fly ash. The predicted values were satisfied with the experimental results. © 2018, Fundatia Serban Solacolu. All rights reserved.},

Mobile device-based speaker authentication is one of the predominant biometric-based authentication schemes. As the mobile devices are vulnerable to physical attacks, speech template stored in the mobile devices may be compromised. To protect the speech template, it should be stored in the encrypted form. Audio templates produce the large bitstream that leads to long encryption phase. Hence, there is a need for lightweight cryptosystem for audio template protection.

abstract={Prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in children has been increasing over the years. These children, when compared to typically growing children, face challenges in leading a day-to-day life. Other than the social interactions, communication and cognitive skills, psychomotor skill deficits are also found in them. This paper focuses on enhancement of psychomotor skills in children with ASD by employing a mechatronic training kit. Training using this kit aims at developing skills like 'palmar grasp', 'wrist rotation' and 'eye-hand coordination'. Trials were conducted with six children with autism aged between four and nine years. Significant improvements were seen in these children both in skills and in behaviour after the training. Thus, teaching psychomotor skills to children with autism using the newly developed mechatronic door training kit is found to be working and the results are encouraging. © by Ramya S.

abstract={System-on-chip (SoC) reduces the computation delay by incorporating multiple processors in a single chip. Obviously these processors are working in parallel to meet the time budget. In SoC, the bottleneck is the bus connecting medium. Network-on-Chip (NoC) eliminates this bottleneck by replacing the bus connecting medium with router based network. But NoC has area and power problems. The significant portion of area consumption comes from the presence of buffers. Buffers are the major cause of power consumption also. Bufferless routers reduce these problems by eliminating buffers from the routers. Many bufferless algorithms are available to reduce power. But they suffer in performance. CHIPPER is one of the notable bufferless algorithms which optimize the performance and power. In this research, some mechanisms are presented to further enhance the power consumption of the CHIPPER router. Experimental results show the power consumption is reduced over 10 percent of the existing technique. © 2019, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.. All rights reserved.},

This paper proposes a medical image watermarking, by applying wavelet transform, using an interpolation technique. EPI data is embedded within the transformed medical image to generate a watermarked image. At the extraction side, EPI data are extracted and medical image is reconstructed without any loss. The performance of the proposed method is analyzed using a peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), mean absolute error (MAE) and structural similarity index (SSIM).

abstract={Exchange of biomedical data through the internet has achieved tremendous success in the recent past, with the necessity of security in every transmission. It has become indispensable to replenish secrecy in biomedical data by avoiding the access of illegitimate users. To evade such disclosure of medical data, a proposal of encryption system along with Cognitive Radio (CR) has been employed. In this paper, CR has been programmed to choose the non-availability of the primary user and by automatically detecting the presence of available spectrum in the channel using Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP). Then using the identified free spectrum, encrypted medical data has been transmitted and exchanged between the authenticated users in rural healthcare units. The proposed encryption technique initiates Latin Square Image Cipher (LSIC) which offers double encryption by making use of two different random keys. Then the output has been subjected to a quantum computation encryption method in which Quantum Walks (QW) serves as a key generator which is meant for its natural nonlinear chaotic behaviour. QW is followed up by the disintegration of Knight’s tour permutation process which helps in tamper proofing and authentication. Finally, shear based affine transform has been employed to avoid imperfections in the medical data. The proposed scheme curtails the insecure medical image communication in biomedical research by creating an authenticated communication link among peers. Metrics such as Number of Pixel Changing Rate (NPCR), Unified Average Changing Intensity (UACI), correlation coefficients, chi-square tests, global and local entropies were estimated and compared with the available literature results. © 2018, Scientific Publishers of India.

Similarly, Prosopis juliflora is a shrub or small tree in the family Fabaceae, a kind of mesquite which is considered to be a potential threat for ground water in South India. Hence, this has to eradicate so as to maintain the groundwater and also to effectively utilize its ash thereby reducing environmental pollution, this can be used as a partial replacement for cement. In this regard, this paper investigates the technical feasibility of using prosopis juliflora ash (PJA) as cementitious material by partially (10, 20, 30 and 40 %) replacing cement by prosopis juliflora ash.

abstract={The distributed computing environment claims high protection of centralized servers. One of the protection mechanism is biometric authentication which provides a reliable solution to control access on servers. The security of user's data depends on biometric systems, so such biometric templates should be protected from identity theft. Different approaches have been proposed to protect biometric templates, from that chaos based biometric cryptosystem become popular because of its properties such as ergodicity, determinism, high sensitivity on seed values. To enhance the security, this work developed a new two-dimensional Logistic Sine Map (2DLSM) by merging sine map to standard 2D logistic map. The proposed biometric cryptosystem is the sequential arrangement of confusion and diffusion process. Both processes are carried out by utilizing the chaotic stream generated by 2DLSM.

abstract={We explore the electronic properties of germanene nanotubes (GeNTs) using first-principles calculations with the non-equilibrium Green’s function technique. The adsorption of two different gases, namely NO2 and SO2, onto GeNT is investigated using van der Waals density functional technique. Moreover, the change in the band gap-energy is noticed upon interaction of small NO2 and SO2 gas molecules. The shift in the peaks is observed in the conduction band upon adsorption of small NO2 and SO2 molecules on the GeNT. The calculated adsorption energies range from − 0.156 to − 0.609 eV. The transmission spectrum showed that the transition of electrons is prominent for SO2 molecules rather than NO2 molecules onto the GeNT. In addition, the electron density diagram also indicate that a transfer of electrons occurs among the gas molecules and the GeNT electroresistive molecular device. The I–V characteristics of GeNT device clearly reveal the change in the current, which varies in the magnitude from 10−9 to 10−6 A upon adsorption of gas molecules on GeNT device. Thus, we suggest that germanene nanotube molecular device can be employed for the detection of NO2 and SO2 small molecules. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Parkinson’s disease is one of the notable neurodegenerative disorders caused by insufficient production of dopamine which damages the motor skills and voice. Advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT) has fuelled the development of healthcare systems. In this article, we propose an intelligent system for detecting Parkinson’s disease to provide proper medication by analysing voice samples. Instead of relying on limited storage capacity and computational resources of IoT, the recent healthcare systems take advantages of the cloud server. On the other hand, the utilization of cloud computing incurs the issues of data privacy and additional communication costs to the healthcare systems. To address this issue, we propose to utilize Fog computing as a midway layer between end devices and the cloud server. The proposed system employs the combinatorial Fuzzy K-nearest Neighbor and Case-based Reasoning classifier for the better classification of the Parkinson patients from healthy individuals. On the detection of abnormality, the proposed healthcare system is designed to generate an immediate alert to the patient. The proposed system is experimentally evaluated on the UCI-Parkinson dataset, and the results reveal the improved performance of our system over baseline approaches. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Water splitting using electrocatalysts is expected to provide an alternative green energy source to meet increasing energy demands as well as addressing environmental concerns related to fossil fuels. Herein, we report one-step synthesis of sulfur, nitrogen and Au-doped carbon quantum dots (Au-SCQDs) and strong enhancement of fluorescence intensity and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic activity of amorphous Co(OH)2 nanoparticles compared to pure Co(OH)2 as well as commercial RuO2 and Pt/C catalysts. Au doping into sulfur and nitrogen co-doped CQDs showed over seventy times enhanced fluorescence. OER studies of amorphous-Co(OH)2 incorporated Au-SCQDs produced current density of 178 mA cm-2 at the applied potential of 2.07 V whereas un-doped Co(OH)2 showed current density of 59 mA cm-2. To produce geometric current density of 10 mA cm-2, amorphous Co(OH)2-Au-SCQDs (CSA) required 388-456 mV overpotential depending on the Au ion concentration used for preparing the Au-SCQDs, which is equal to or lower than overpotential required by commercial electrocatalysts. The strongly enhanced OER activity of Co(OH)2-Au-SCQDs (CSA) was attributed to the presence of electronegative metallic conducting Au atoms along with the high catalytic surface area of amorphous Co(OH)2. The present studies demonstrate a new method of exploiting amorphous Co(OH)2NPs electrocatalysts that could provide more catalytically active sites by integrating an electronegative conducting Au atom doped SCQDs matrix. © The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique 2018.},

abstract={The host-guest complexes of a recently synthesized tetracyclo(9-methyl-2,7-carbazole) (TCC) with several guest molecules, such as H2, H2O, H2S, CO, CO2, CS2, N2, NO, NO2, F2, Cl2, Br2, HF, HCl, HBr, CH4, C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6, were studied by using density functional theory. Functionalized symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (F-SAPT) was employed to determine the intermolecular interactions, which incorporated various binding energy components. The interactions were found to be mostly of the van der Waals type, predominantly including electrostatic and dispersion effects. A negative value of Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) revealed that the complex Br2@TCC was the most stable at room temperature (298.15 K) followed by HF@TCC and CS2@TCC. Other complexes were found to be stable at lower temperatures, as inferred from their ΔH and ΔS values. Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations were performed to predict the maximum gravimetric storage of the gas molecules in the TCC container and the selectivity of gas molecules from their respective congeners. The selectivity of Br2 was highest among all and H2S, CS2, NO2, HBr, and C2H6 selectivity was found to be higher under ambient conditions from their respective congeners. © The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.},

abstract={The changes in microstructure and mechanical properties of Equal Channel Angular Pressing (ECAP) processed Aluminium Magnesium alloy at different channel angles (900, 1200) were discussed in this paper. Ultrafine grain of A5083 was produced by severe plastic deformation method using ECAP. Al 5083 has good formability due to excellent ductility. It has proven itself as a lightweight, durable and affordable material that allows going faster speeds. The microstructure, fracture behaviour was investigated by means of optical microscope and Scanning Electron Microscope. Mechanical properties of the specimens were evaluated under both channel angles. Tensile Strength, Misorientation angle and hardness were compared. Results reveal that 1200 processed samples posses lower strength than 900 channel angle. ECAP was performed at Route A with the radius of curvature of 200 up to four passes. In both the cases the strength increases after ECAP passes but higher the value was obtained in 90°Channel angle. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The increase in population mobility due to the growing size of cities has determined a significant increase in the number of vehicles, which have resulted in many challenges for road traffic management authorities to control traffic congestion. The ultimate challenge lies in congestion detection and finding an alternate route for the vehicles to reach the destination on time. Several solutions for Traffic Management System (TMS) have been proposed to identify congestion and find alternate routes. In the present scenario, the system receives notifications about a traffic event from the vehicles that suffer from congestion, calculates new routes, and then notifies the drivers to follow new path by using inter-vehicle communication. When the server receives the alert message from the vehicle, it calculates new route and updates. In such systems, only on the event of congestion, the alternate route is processed by the server. To address this problem, we have proposed a new algorithm called Recursive Re-routing Algorithm (RRA). Here, the congestion information are pre-processed. The probability of expected congestion is calculated beforehand at every intermediate path from source to destination on the server side and it is returned to the vehicle. The shortest path between source and destination is calculated using DIJKSTRA. Traffic density and the threshold value are calculated from the traffic data available under different circumstances. Based on the congestion information inferred from the traffic density, and a threshold value fixed at every path, RRA re-routes to the new best path that can handle congestion intelligently and better than the existing systems. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2018.},

abstract={Halosarcia indica (Amaranthaceae), an Edible food used in Indian traditional folk medicine. The present study aims to evaluate the diuretic, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory properties of Halosarcia indica aqueous extract (HAE) on Wistar albino rats. HAE was found to contain chlorogenic acid, sinapic acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, scopoletin, quercetin 3-O-β-D-glucoside and β-sitosterol-D-glucopyranoside. HAE increased the urine excreted (Diuretic Index: 1.62–1.96 over 2–10 h) and curbed writhing responses significantly (40%) compared to aspirin (54.56%). It showed significant reduction in carrageenan plantar edema (42%) similar to indomethacin (48%). Anti-inflammatory activity by Cotton Granuloma method proved that HAE significantly reduced weights of pellets (dry weight 44.93 mg, wet weight 127.45 mg) similar to diclofenac sodium (dry weight 33.2 mg, wet weight 123.58 mg). Acute toxicity studies showed HAE to be safe until 2000 mg/kg. The above findings evidently propose that HAE has diuretic, analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity as observed with rodent models. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={We studied the geometric stability of pristine graphyne nanosheet (Gpn-NS) and electronic properties for the possible use of graphyne sheet for the chemical sensor. The center of attention of the work is to probe the nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) at the earlier stage of chemical explosion using Gpn-nanosheet material. The geometric stability of pristine Gpn base material is entrenched with the formation energy and also verified with phonon band structure. The interaction of different NACs such as hexanitrostilbene, M-dinitrobenzene, picric acid, and 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene on Gpn material is studied in connection with the Bader charge transfer, average energy gap changes, adsorption energy, and band gap. Moreover, the adsorption energy of NACs on Gpn-NS varies in the order of − 0.178 to − 0.627 eV. The outcomes of the suggested work infer that Gpn-NS can be used to probe the NAC vapors. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

In case a robot is unable to decide the direction in which it has to move with the information available, the decision can be made with the help of external source. Most of the algorithms involve computations, which may sometime require lot of memory and time. Our work deals with avoiding those calculations by sending direct visual feed to the control room where the environment can be analysed, which enables the robot to move from source to the goal position. The robot also displays the coordinates on the console screen which can be used for creating maps. During our work we observed that by decreasing the time interval for refreshing the coordinates the closest distance the robot can go towards the obstacle also decreases thus allowing the robot to move through very narrow paths it can fit.

The friction stir casting process is carried out to prepare the specimens of 93% of Al6061 reinforced with 6% TiB2. Full factorial design of experiments is conducted by considering the four input parameters namely current (A), gap voltage (V), depth of cut (d) and pulse duration (T) at five different levels. The 3-dimensional surface texture and roughness are measured using white layer interferometer for all the drilled holes, and the values are obtained using Gwyddion software. The results indicate if the current value and depth of cut increase, the value of the average surface roughness and the root-mean-square roughness also increases, whereas the surface roughness is inversely proportional to the discharge gap between the tool and work piece. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.},

abstract={Rapid growth in the use of digitized images in commercial, business, government and medical use has led to the need for protecting the images against eavesdroppers and securely transmit them in the network. Images pertained to finance, medical and crime investigation fields are expected to be confidential because of its sensitivity. As reported in the literature most of encryption algorithms developed for gray images is only applied for color images. An exclusive system to exploit color spaces has been proposed that functions in a multilayered model. It is named as HybRid multilAyereD chaotic ImAge eNcrypTion (RADIANT) system to process sensitive color images especially applicable for medical and forensic domains. In the first layer, logistic mapping is done to perform chaotic masking, followed by DNA encoding in the second layer. This layer objective is to increase confusion diffusion level by substitution permutation. In the third layer, ECC over GF(p) that focus on spatial domain is adopted for encryption as it has been identified as a prominent encryption technique being popular for its mathematical strength. The proposed RADIANT system is hybrid in nature as it operates on both symmetric and asymmetric cryptosystem combination. Experimental results obtained by testing with bench mark images ascertain an ideal measure for MSE, PSNR that makes it more suitable for signal processing activities involving sensitive color images. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={This paper deals with design and simulation of a three phase shunt hybrid power compensator consisting of a pair of 5th and 7th selective harmonic elimination passive power filters connected in series with a conventional active power filter with reduced kVA rating. The objective is to enhance the power quality in a distribution network feeding variety of nonlinear, time varying and unbalanced loads. In this work, a control scheme based an energy function using Lyapunov method has been formulated for a shunt hybrid power filter. The developed control law is based on synchronous rotating reference frame theory, which generates a state variable model of the nonlinear system which is linked to development of a switching function based scheme for controlling the active component of the hybrid filter. The stability of the state model following disturbances at the operating point is examined by introducing an energy function for applying Lyapunov's direct method. Here the derivative of the Lyapunov energy function is made to be negative definite by suitable choice of parameters for ensuring stability and quick response. The performance of the shunt hybrid compensation topology along with the proposed control strategy for balanced, unbalanced and various other loading conditions have been evaluated by simulation of the entire system in Matlab/Simulink platform. It is found that the designed hybrid compensator results in enhanced power quality in the distribution system, satisfying IEEE 519-1992 standards. © 2018 Control Engineering and Applied Informatics Journal.},

There are three different types of customers are considered, which are priority customers, ordinary customers and negative customers. The priority customers do not form any queue and have an exclusive preemptive priority to receive their services over ordinary customers. The negative customer is arriving during the service time of any positive customer, will remove the positive customer from the service. If the interrupted customer is an ordinary customer, he will leave the system. As soon as the orbit becomes empty at the time of service completion, the server goes for a working vacation. The server works at a lower speed during a working vacation period.

While most of the watermarking schemes look to assist authentication through data concealing in specific section, reversibility of the cover images remains a challenge to be addressed. Post tampering retrieval of the cover associated with the watermarking is the prime objective of this work. The key elements involved in this work are Integer Wavelet Transform (IWT) and Block Truncation Code (BTC). After application of IWT on the chosen cover image, the BTC generated from the HH sub band will be embedded in select regions of the LL sub band of the transformed image. BTC has been employed in this approach and tested for various pixel block sizes namely 2 × 2, 4 × 4 and 8 × 8 in the preferred HH sub band which carry the edge information. While the imperceptibility of recovered cover image was commendable through this reversible scheme, the suggested approach also withstands noticeably against a variety of image processing attacks. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The efficient segmentation of customers of an enterprise is categorized into groups of similar behavior based on the RFM (Recency, Frequency and Monetary) values of the customers. The transactional data of a company over is analyzed over a specific period. Segmentation gives a good understanding of the need of the customers and helps in identifying the potential customers of the company. Dividing the customers into segments also increases the revenue of the company. It is believed that retaining the customers is more important than finding new customers. For instance, the company can deploy marketing strategies that are specific to an individual segment to retain the customers. This study initially performs an RFM analysis on the transactional data and then extends to cluster the same using traditional K-means and Fuzzy C- Means algorithms. In this paper, a novel idea for choosing the initial centroids in K- Means is proposed.

In this work, the piston crown and outer surface of the cylinder liner of a diesel engine was coated with the ceramic material Aluminum Titanate by plasma spray technique. Thus, a thermal barrier was provided to the parts of combustion chamber with this ceramic coating. Ceramic coatings applied to the combustion chamber of diesel engine are preferred to reduce the transfer of heat from the combustion chamber to the cooling system. The biodiesel (Sesame oil methyl ester) was initially prepared from sesame oil by transesterfication process. Then, it is blended with diesel to a suitable proportion of 10% and 20% by volume. In this investigation, the brake thermal efficiency for diesel in ceramic coated engine was found to be higher than the conventional diesel engine. The efficiency was improved by 1.77% compared to conventional diesel engine. The emissions like carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon except oxides of nitrogen were decreased due to complete combustion of the fuel in the thermally insulated combustion chamber of the LHR engine.NOX was found to be higher for LHR engine with diesel and biodiesel blends due to higher in-cylinder gas temperature as compared to the conventional diesel engine using diesel fuel. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.},

In random deployment, single or a group of MSNs may fall at the same location or at different locations, whose starting positions of traversal and traversal paths may differ from the preplanned. This work formulates the problem of scheduling the MSNs in distributed manner so that the entire region is covered without coverage holes with minimum energy depletion. Finally, some computationally practical algorithms for multiple MSNs with fault and non-fault tolerant support are presented and their performances compared. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={A risk assessment practice determines the risk both quantitatively and qualitatively, such that risks are analysed and assessed thoroughly. Several methods are available to mitigate the failures in a construction project. This project focuses on identifying risks and mitigating them to reduce failures. On a questionnaire basis, a survey from various employees working on different projects is conducted by considering seven major factors of risks and the normalised score of each factor is ranked. Based on the normalized score values, least three risk factors were identified and Analytical Hierarchy Process(AHP) is applied by manual calculations. AHP is based on human judgements and objective evaluation, which examines the consistency of the evaluation by Eigen values. Validation of the identified factors is also done through MAT Lab and is compared with the manual method. Consistency and hierarchy of the identified factors has been found out, thereby mitigating the failures and increasing the efficiency of the projects. © 2018 Authors.},

abstract={The construction industry has been responsible for degrading the environment due to ecological imbalance caused during the extraction and production of building materials. To make this production of construction materials cleaner, the dependency on conventional materials has to be reduced. With this aim, this article presents an experimental study on partial replacement of cement, sand and aggregate by cowdung ash(CDA), granite powder(GP) and marble stone(MS) respectively. For this, four series of mix proportions were prepared to evaluate the compressive strength and the split tensile strength. Replacement ratios of the first, second, third and fourth mixes are (5%CDA, 10%GP, 15%MS), (5%CDA, 15%GP, 30%MS), (10%CDA, 15%GP, 30%MS), (5%CDA, 7.5%GP, 15%MS) respectively. Results revealed that the partial replacement of binders and fillers is effective to enhance compressive and split tensile strength of concrete. This would enable the construction industry to reduce their dependency on river sand and natural coarse aggregate. © 2018 Authors.},

abstract={Disposal of dyes into the environment causes serious damage and they may be toxic to some aquatic organisms due to their breakdown products. The colouring pigments present in the effluent may give aesthetic look and it affects the photosynthetic in plants. The chemical and physical methods have many disadvantages which can overcome by biological method because it is cost saving and environmentally benign. In biological methods, absorbents like Bacteria, fungus, cellular membrane etc. can be used. Since yeast is cheap and more effective it is preferred. In the present study an attempt was made to examine the potential of Saccharomyces Cerevisiae in decolorization of Congo red dye. The influence of different condition in variation of concentration, time and pH in that Study was made to find the optimum condition in which the maximum decolorization was occur. The UV Spectrum shows the maximum wavelength was observed in 496.93. At room temperature, the maximum decolorization of 90.7% was observed in the concentration of 40 ppm(0.004g/100ml) and it took place after 18hrs. In the next experiment, maximum decolorization of 96.88% was obtained in the concentration of 40ppm(0.004g/100ml) and pH of 4 at a time of 17hrs with a dosage of 0.1g in room temperature which is considering to be the optimum condition. The above results show the potential of this Saccharomyces Cerevisiae to be used in the biological treatment of textile effluent under optimum condition. © 2018 Authors.},

abstract={Road transport plays an important role in India's economy. It enables the country's transportation sector to contribute 6.1% towards India's GDP. The road network in our country is considered as a critical factor to the country's development, social integration and security needs of the country. The Government of India has promoted foreign investments in highway projects to bring out high standards and quality. India's road network carries over 65% of freight and 85% passenger traffic. The traffic volume carried by the national highways almost exceeds the designed traffic volume, and hence the desired speed cannot be achieved. Thus, widening of highways becomes necessary. The population growth is also to be considered and hence provision for future widening is to be provided. Our paper deal with the geometric design for widening of NH-9 is carried out using MX-Bentley software as per IRC specifications. This design includes horizontal and vertical profiling throughout the stretch of the road, according to the existing topographic data. The radius of the curve has been increased to make a smooth curve. Also, the vertical profile has been designed based on the allowable gradient and sight distances. From this, accommodation of more traffic volume and increment of design speed seems to be possible. © 2018 Authors.},

abstract={Leaf Spring is one of the oldest components widely used in commercial vehicles due to easy manufacturing cost and better load carrying capacity. Due to heavy competitive market and strict rules from governments, automakers want to reduce pollution, fuel consumption etc. Further weight reduction is the most effective way of improving fuel economy without losing the performance of the vehicle. So, usage of Composite Materials is gradually increased in the Automobile Industry. In the beginning, Composites are used only for decorative purposes. But recently composites have been used in structural parts also. Some Sports car manufacturers even make an entire automobile body out of carbon fibre. Coming to Leaf Spring, Steel is still preferred due to its high strength and Energy Absorption Ratio etc. The applications of hybrid composite materials in various fields formerly cannot achieve using conventional materials. In this research article, Carbon/Glass Epoxy Composite is proposed as leaf spring material. The specimen is fabricated and mechanically tested for tensile strength, Impact Strength and Flexural Strength. Also, Solid modelling of Leaf Spring is done using SolidWorks 2014 and FEA is done using ANSYS 16.2. Results are documented, compared and discussed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The present study attempts to find the optimal level of parameters for multi performance characteristics in laser welding of incoloy 800HT using Grey-Fuzzy algorithm. Incoloy 800HT, which comes under the family of austenitic nickel-chromium-based super alloys exhibits good strength, excellent resistance to carburization and oxidation in high-temperature exposure. This alloy has been considered as a prominent material for fourth generation nuclear power plants. Laser welding has proved to be advantageous due to its characteristics such as narrow fusion zone, low heat input, concentrated heat intensity and the ability to align the beam to a specific position with respect to joint line. Taguchi L9 experiment was used to perform laser welding on incoloy 800HT. The input parameters chosen were the welding speed, focal position and laser power. The output performance characteristics were the hardness, toughness and ultimate tensile strength. To improve the quality of the weld, the optimal combination of laser welding parameters was chosen using grey relational analysis and grey fuzzy logic approach offers improved Grey-Fuzzy reasoning grade and has less uncertainties when compared with grey relational technique. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to find percentage contribution of the laser welding parameters and found that welding speed was the most influential factor in welding of incoloy 800HT. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Self-compacting fibre reinforced concrete (SCFRC) is an inventive material in construction industry, which is widely used nowadays due to its inherent capability of consolidating under its self-weight in the fresh state while the advantages of fibre present are harnessed in the hardened state. The insertion of fibres, notably steel fibres in self-compacting concrete leads to significant enrichment in flexural strength, ductility, fatigue strength and toughness. In this paper, the flexural fatigue strength of SCFRC beams have been statistically commanded. For this purpose, the experimental fatigue test results of earlier researcher have been investigated using Weibull distribution. The Weibull parameters were assessed using three mathematical methods namely, energy pattern factor method (EPFM), graphical method (GM) and method of moments (MOM). The mean value of Weibull parameters was used to incorporate survival probability into stress and fatigue life (S-N) relationships. Based on the Weibull theory, empirical formula (double logarithm fatigue equations) from the S-N relationship of SCFRC beams under different survival probability are proposed based on the experimental investigation of earlier research. As a result, reveals that the proposed fatigue equations are accurate, which facilitates the designer to evaluate the fatigue life of SCFRC at required level of survival probability. © 2018 Journal of Applied Science and Engineering.

abstract={Leaf essential oils of an unexplored wild cinnamon, Cinnamomum walaiwarense Kosterm. collected from seven different locations in the southern Western Ghats, India were characterized by GC-FID and GC-MS analyses. Benzyl benzoate was the principal constituent of the leaf essential oil present at a concentration from 65 to 89.8%. Another major constituent was phenylethyl benzoate. The results on antioxidant (ABTS and DPPH radical scavenging) and hypoglycemic (α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibitory) activities show that the leaf essential oils exhibited better activities than benzyl benzoate. The very least antioxidant and inhibitory activities of benzyl benzoate show that these activities of the leaf essential oils were due to the synergistic action of minor constituents. The rich content of benzyl benzoate in the leaf essential oil makes C. walaiwarense a potential natural source of this compound. As benzyl benzoate is an excellent scabicide and pediculicide, the essential oil may be further investigated for industrial and other medicinal applications. © 2018 Natural Product Incorporation.

abstract={Background: Radiotherapy is the most widely used treatment method for average and advanced lung cancer patients. Moreover, the clinical toxicities caused by radiotherapy are categorized into acute radiation pneumonitis and late pulmonary fibrosis. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a complex physiological process involves many signaling molecules and proteins like adaptor proteins, and transcriptional factors. It was identified as a significant mechanism for fibrosis, wound healing and also cancer. A variety of biomarkers have appeared in radiation-induced lung EMT, some of which are acquired (N-cadherin, vimentin and fibronectin, etc.) and some of which are repressed during the transition of epithelial cells (E-cadherin, zona occludens-1). Objective: In the current review, we highlighted the radiation-induced lung EMT signaling pathway and their mediators. We also discuss the EMT in cancer, fibrosis and its epigentics. Results: Radiation-induced lung EMT is controlled by numerous signaling pathways like MAPK, NF- κB, Wnt, microRNAs and histone modifications. Transcriptional factors such as Snail, slug, twist, ZEB1 (Zinc finger E-box binding-1) and ZEB2 (Zinc finger E-box binding-2) proteins are inducers linking radiation-induced EMT and fibrosis. Epigenetic modulations are heritable changes in the structure and function of the genome that occurs without any change in the sequence. Several approaches showed the role of epigenetic modifications and its inhibitors in controlling fibrosis and cancer. Only limited reports are focused on understanding the epigenetic regulations of radiation-induced lung EMT. Conclusion: The current review focused on recent findings regarding radiation-induced lung fibrosis and EMT, thus provides some information on important signaling pathways, its subsequent expression of genes and proteins involved in EMT. This review also discussed various inhibitors that could be used to treat EMT related diseases, i.e., fibrosis, cancer. © 2018 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={In recent technology development, images are playing a vital role in different applications such as social network, biometrics, medical, military and satellite fields. It is essential to protect these images from intruders during transmission on insecure networks. This paper proposes a new chaotic map for image cryptosystem by combining tent map and 2D logistic map in different form. The proposed 2D Logistic-Tent map (2DLT) generates two chaotic series. These chaotic series are used to perform the confusion and diffusion phases of image cryptosystem. A comparison between existing standard 2D logistic map and proposed 2D logistic-tent map shows that the proposed map has high random chaotic series than the existing one. In order to evaluate the strength of the proposed image cryptosystem, the developed chaos cryptosystem was subjected to different analysis such as differential, key size and sensitivity, chosen plain text and cipher text attack analyses. All the analysed results proved that the proposed cipher has good security level and can be used for different secure image communication applications.

abstract={In the recent years, the reported cases of mitochondrial disorders have reached a colossal number. These disorders spawn a sundry of pathological conditions, which lead to pernicious symptoms and even fatality. Due to the unpredictable etiologies, mitochondrial diseases are putatively referred to as “mystondria” (mysterious diseases of mitochondria). Although present-day research has greatly improved our understanding of mitochondrial disorders, effective therapeutic interventions are still at the precursory stage. The conundrum becomes further complicated because these pathologies might occur due to either mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations or due to mutations in the nuclear DNA (nDNA), or both. While correcting nDNA mutations by using gene therapy (replacement of defective genes by delivering wild-type (WT) ones into the host cell, or silencing a dominant mutant allele that is pathogenic) has emerged as a promising strategy to address some mitochondrial diseases, the complications in correcting the defects of mtDNA in order to renovate mitochondrial functions have remained a steep challenge. In this review, we focus specifically on the selective gene therapy strategies that have demonstrated prospects in targeting the pathological mutations in the mitochondrial genome, thereby treating mitochondrial ailments. © 2018 Elsevier B.V. and Mitochondria Research Society},

This data needs to be protected from the unauthorized users on the web. Cryptography is used to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data in the virtual world. The strength of the cryptographic algorithm relies on the complexity in-volved in retrieving the original content from the unintelligible information. The system proposed in this paper focuses on the use of a different mechanism to increase complexity involved in the cryptanalysis. Different cryptographic techniques are used to create a modi-fied plain text and modified key. The newly generated key is used to encrypt the modified plaintext to generate the ciphertext. From the security analysis, it is evident that the time taken for cryptanalysis by the proposed scheme is more when compared with the existing systems. © 2018 G. Manikandan et al.},

abstract={Dynamic spectrum management has the advantage of well-organised assignment of channels. But analysis shows that still the spectrum is not used efficiently always. For the proficient management of this valuable spectrum cognitive radio has proved to be a helpful tool. The main function of the cognitive radio is to sense the availability of the spectrum for its occupancy. So spectrum sensing becomes the prime task. This sensing process by a cognitive radio is interrupted by malicious user who is also a cognitive radio but selfish in gaining the access of the spectrum. Hence a helper node based authentication scheme has been proposed. Authentication based data transfer is achieved by the inclusion of tag in the data send by the helper node to the cognitive user depicting the absence of primary user. The authentication tag is generated using Bhutasankya algorithm and Katapayadi algorithm and embedded in the error control code block of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) based helper node. Utilizing the sensed spectrum, patient information is transmitted to the hospital from the remote location. This avoids the travel need to be made by the elderly persons from the remote center to the hospital for further consultation. To gain the advantage of re-programmability, the authentication scheme is implemented on Cyclone II FPGA. © 2018, Scientific Publishers of India. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Heat fins play an important role in removing undesired heat generated in many electronic applications. Heat fins are extended surfaces which are provided to enhance heat transfer. Quite a number of studies have been done on conventional open top rectangular fins. However, there is a necessity to increase heat transfer rate for particular fin geometry with geometric constraints. In the present study, experiments are done in a standard heat sink with open top and closed top rectangular fins. The numerical model of rectangular fins with closed top plate under forced convection conditions is validated with the experimental results. Studies are done using commercial CFD code ANSYS FLUENT©. The length, width and height of fins are kept constant. Numerical study is done by varying velocity, number of fins, top plate thickness, fin thickness and heat duty. The results of numerical analysis show that fins with closed top plate have enhanced heat transfer rate than that of fins without closed top plate. The base plate temperature is predicted by training the artificial neural network (ANN) based on the data obtained from numerical simulations. Dimensions to achieve minimum base plate temperature are predicted by applying genetic algorithm (GA) on the designed neural network. Copyright © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={Purpose: This study aims to focus on experimenting the performance of aluminum (Al) powder mixed electric discharge machining (PMEDM) of two different materials viz plastic mould die steel (AISI P20) and nickel-based super alloy (Nimonic 75). This experimental study also focuses on using three different tool materials such as copper, brass and tungsten to analyze their influence on the process output. These materials find many uses in industrial as well as aerospace applications. The performance measures considered in this work are material removal rate (MRR), tool wear rate (TWR) and surface roughness (SR). Design/methodology/approach: The experimental design used in this work is based on Taguchi’s L18 orthogonal array. Besides considering work and tool material as one of the process variables, other process variables are peak current (Ip), pulse on time (Ton) and concentration of powder (Cp). The analysis of variance (ANOVA) is performed on the experimental data to determine the significant variables that influence the output. Findings: It is found that copper produced maximum MRR and brass tool exhibited higher TWR. However, the surface finish of the machined work piece was very much improved by using the brass tool. Though the performance of tungsten tool lies between the above two tool materials, it showed very little wear during EDM with or without the addition of Al powder. Originality/value: The experimental investigation of PMEDM of nickel-based super alloy (Nimonic 75) has not been attempted before. Besides that, the study on the influence of tungsten tool on the performance of EDM is also very limited. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={This paper deals with the new type of retrial queueing system with working vacations and working breakdowns. The system may become defective by disasters at any point of time when the regular busy server is in operation. The occurrence of disasters forces all customers to leave the system and causes the main server to fail. At a failure instant, the main server is sent to the repair and the repair period immediately begins. As soon as the orbit becomes empty at regular service completion instant or disaster occurs in the regular busy server, the server goes for a working vacation and working breakdown (called lower speed service period). During this period, the server works at a lower service rate to arriving customers. Using the supplementary variable technique, we analyze the steady state probability generating function of system size. Some important system performance measures are obtained. Finally, some numerical examples and cost optimization analysis are presented. © EDP Sciences, ROADEF, SMAI 2018.},

abstract={A watermarking technique is proposed using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) techniques to implement information hiding. Embedding can be done by dividing the host image into four rectangular segments which are non-overlapping called sub-images using hybrid scheme. Redundancy reduces cropping attack. The main aim is to reduce the effect of geometric bouts, such as rotation, translation, and affine translation using synchronization technique. Watermarks can be a binary random sequence of different lengths. Data replication and hamming code are two error modification methods utilized in the proposed scheme. Achieved results show comparable robustness against geometric attacks and signal processing. Contourlet transform can be used to improve the visual feature of the image. After embedding the image or data, contourlet transform is applied in the frequency domain to improve robustness. The optimal mapping function is obtained using contourlet transform which increases Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and hiding capacity with low distortion. © 2018 Authors.},

abstract={In the modern world, Radio Frequency identification system plays a major role that automatically identifies and tracks tag attached to an object. RFID technology has been extensively used in many areas including agriculture, manufacturing, healthcare, transportation, etc. RFID system can be used in hospitals to increase the safety of patients by providing an RFID tag to the persons who visit them including doctors, nurses, and relatives. This method can be used along with a door lock but in the case of emergency, it becomes risky. Also, the same method can be used for secured access to pharmaceutical supplies which avoid illegal access to the medicines. Sensor network which is the core of IoT technology can be integrated with the RFID system to make it more efficient to be deployed in several application services. In this paper, a solution is proposed that can integrate the RFID system with the IoT technology by using IR sensors which help to get rid of illegal entry or access in hospitals. © 2018 Authors.},

abstract={Estimation of cloud services in a distributed computing environment is taking more interests. There is a wealth of developing cloud benefit assets that makes it difficult for the user to select the best administration related to own applications in an evolving multiple cloud environment, particularly for online processing applications. To make clients to choose their interested cloud adequately, we need a model which holds the cloud profits, and hence dynamic cloud benefit determination procedure named Dynamic Cloud Selection (DCS) is adapted. In this procedure of selected services, every cloud benefit business deals with some group of cloud administrations, and executes the DCS method. This paper studies the cloud selection and proposed a way to improve the cloud selection based on related measures. The measures are reliability, response time, throughput, availability, utilization, resilience, scalability, and elasticity. The system is contrived to enhance the cloud benefit choice powerfully and to restore the best administration result to the client. These measures are used to form best selection strategy. User memory requirement is also considered to improve the preferred task. Experimental results proved that using this new strategy, best cloud selection is made efficiently. © 2018 Authors.},

abstract={Incorporation of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in healthcare industry explored the possibilities to optimize the supply of all the available medical resources and provide reliable, efficient healthcare services to the aged people and patients with physical disabilities and chronic illness. In consumer electronics and growing costs of healthcare a vision of connected e-health has evolved which constitute Personal Health Devices (PHD). Present day mobile devices are capable enough to gather data from various sensors and often play a role in physical fitness gateway and then data are collected in PHDs. The network overhead and suitability of the proposed solution for the different environment is presented which includes the integration of different wireless interfaces with cloud services. The work focuses on adapting the MQTT (Message Queue Telemetry Transport) communication model. This protocol is preferred over CoAP which is one-one protocol because it is one of the lightweight protocols used in TCP/IP and it has the feature of many to many communication models. The evaluation of the work is on a PHD prototype device and feasibility of the solution is discussed. The proposed work is to design and develop a Real-time healthcare monitoring system using IoT which is featured with Random Forest algorithm for heart disease prediction by gathering patient's data from various PHD sensors and timely alert the caretaker as well as a doctor by sending messages through MQTT. It monitors the patient's physiological parameters remotely and diagnoses the heart diseases as early as possible.The main motto is to reduce the cost of healthcare and give people the awareness about health and fitness. © 2018 Authors.},

abstract={Data integrity of outsourced data is main problem in CSP (cloud service provider). Space overhead and computation complexity are very high issue in recent PDP(Provable Data Possession) verification schemes. To overcome such issues MPDP (Mobile Provable Data Possession) schemes using hash tree data structure and Boneh-Lynn-Snacham short signature scheme have been used over decade. Data dynamics is well supported in MPDP scheme via block less verification, dynamic data operations, stateless verification, and verification out sourcing. But still there are some operations which can be performed much more efficiently in some other way than that of the two methods prescribed above. Operations in particular, data modification operations like insertion and deletion operations is somewhat difficult or in other words time consuming in hash tree data structure. In this paper, we have deployed an improved hash tree structure called MPT (Merkle Patricia Tree) for integrity checking.MPT is combination of MHT (Merkle Hash Tree) and patricia tree where each node consists of key-value pairs. As of now, MPT has been used only in block chain technology for providing authentication of transactions through Ethereum. © 2018 Authors.},

The usage of HSC in structures has been increased worldwide and has begun to make an impact in India. Ordinary cementitious materials are weak under tensile loads and fiber reinforced cementitious composites (FRCCs) have been developed to improve this weak point. Specimens such as cubes, cylinders were cast for High Strength concrete containing Alccofine as mineral admixture and reinforced with micro steel fibers to study the mechanical and durability properties at 28 days and 56 days of curing. The concrete were designed to have compressive strength of 60 MPa. Mixtures containing 0% and 10% replacement of cement by Alccofine and with 1%, 2% and 3% of micro steel fibers by weight of concrete were prepared. Durability properties such as Sorptivity, water absorption, resistance against Sulphuric acid, Sodium sulphate and Magnesium sulphate were studied for control, Alccofine and Alccofine with steel fibers for different days of curing.

abstract={Epilepsy is, in general, a diseased condition where the brain fires abnormal signals, which results in convolutions in the muscles-which occurs suddenly to the patients. In this work, we prescribe a novel method to automatically identify the onset of epileptic seizures. A moving window approximate entropy (ApEn) is run over the Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal with the epileptic seizures. ApEn value drops at the conjuncture of the onset of the epileptic seizures. This ApEn characteristic drop is considered as feature for detecting the onset. Moreover this ApEn characteristic drop is enhanced using wavelet transform forming the feature to be in ApEn wavelet framework. Three neural networks namely Feed forward Back propagation, Elman and Radial basis networks is employed for automatically detecting the onset of the epileptic seizure. They are compared with each other for their performance with ApEn as feature and ApEn in wavelet framework as feature. It was found that radial basis network is giving a better overall accuracy of 94%, when their inputs are features being ApEn in wavelet framework. Additionally, the onset sample detected by the algorithm and manually identified onset sample by the encephalographers are compared and it was found that our algorithm was able to detect the onset of the epileptic seizures with an average detection delay of only 0.2 second for the 200 segments of EEG considered across 31 patients, which is low compared to earlier works in the literature. © 2018, Scientific Publishers of India.

abstract={We consider a single server retrial queueing system with variant working vacations and vacation interruption where the regular busy server is subjected to breakdown due to the arrival of negative customers. As soon as the orbit becomes empty at the time of regular service completion for a positive customer, the server takes at most J number working vacations until at least one customer is received in the orbit when the server returns from a working vacation. During the working vacation period, the server serves at a lower speed service rate (µv&lt;µb). Using the method of supplementary variable technique, we determined the steady state probability generating function for the system and its orbit. We also obtained some analytical expressions for various performance measures such as system state probabilities, the mean orbit size, the mean system size, and reliability measures of this model.

abstract={Personal Identification Numbers (PIN) are widely used for authenticating users for financial transactions. PIN numbers are entered at Automatic Teller Machine (ATMs), card payments at Point of Sale (POS) counters and for e-banking services. When PIN numbers are keyed in by the users, they are vulnerable to shoulder surfing and keylogging attacks. By entering PIN numbers through virtual keyboards, the keylogging attacks can be mitigated, but it elevates the risk of shoulder surfing. A number of shoulder surfing resistive keyboard schemes have been proposed. But many of them offer inadequate security and are poor in usability. They also demand substantial user intelligence, training, user memory and additional devices for entering the PIN numbers. Keeping in mind that securing PIN number should not be done at the cost of user inconvenience, a new scheme based on key sliding is proposed in this paper. Two variations of the scheme are presented. They are based on manual and automatic sliding of keys and indirect user entry of PIN numbers. Our proposed schemes are simple and easy to adopt. They are sufficiently stronger against attacks. Our extensive analysis and user study of the schemes have proved their security and usability. © 2018, Zarka Private University. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Herein, earth-abundant cost-effective hybrid copper-cuprous oxide nanoparticles have been fabricated in a carbon matrix (Cu-Cu 2 ONPs@C) and used as bifunctional electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). At a 0.1 mg loading, OER studies of Cu-Cu 2 ONPs@C showed a significantly low overpotential of 530 mV @ 10 mA cm -2 with the applied potential of 2.07 V in 0.4 M KOH. HER studies showed an overpotential of -672 mV @ 10 mA cm -2 with the applied potential of -1.058 V in 0.4 M H 2 SO 4 . Cu-Cu 2 ONPs@C showed a good electrocatalytic current density of 57.7 mA cm -2 for OER and -125 mA cm -2 for HER at a significantly low catalyst loading. For controlled studies, Cu 2 ONPs and CuNPs in carbon matrix have also been synthesized, and their catalytic activities (OER and HER) have been compared with those of the hybrid Cu-Cu 2 ONPs@C. The comparative studies indicated that the presence of conducting metal CuNPs along with Cu 2 ONPs in the carbon matrix enhanced the electrocatalytic activity for both OER and HER as compared to that of pure Cu 2 ONPs and CuNPs in the carbon matrix. Interestingly, the solvent used for fabricating different NP electrodes has also shown significant influence on the electrocatalytic current density. The synthesized hybrid Cu-Cu 2 ONPs@C, Cu 2 ONPs@C, and CuNPs@C were characterized using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), and BET analysis. To the best of our knowledge, the fabricated hybrid Cu-Cu 2 ONP@C exhibited a strong bifunctional electrocatalytic response at a high current density with a low catalyst loading (0.1 mg) among the different Cu-based nanostructured catalysts explored for the water splitting reactions. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={Purpose - The main purpose of this proposed parabolic leaf spring (PLS) is to reduce the weight of the steel leaf spring by developing a new design, to increase the load-carrying capacity, to increase the ride comfort for the passengers and also to achieve a substantial weight reduction in the suspension system by replacing the semi-elliptic leaf spring. Design/methodology/approach - The semi-elliptic steel leaf spring and the PLS are compared based on the load-carrying capacity and weight. The design constraints are stresses and deflection. The dimensions of the HM trekker Jeep semi-elliptic leaf springs are taken. A three-dimensional model is created, and the static structural analysis is performed. The semi-elliptic leaf spring is tested on a universal testing machine, and the experimental result is compared with the analytical result for the validation. After validation, the stress analysis of the PLS is carried out and compared with the stress analysis of the semi-elliptic leaf spring. Findings - The results show that the developed PLS performs better than the semi-elliptic leaf spring in terms of load-carrying capacity and weight reduction.

abstract={Purpose - This paper aims to perform an experimental investigation on the impact strength, compressive strength, tensile strength and flexural strength of fly ash-based green composites and to compare with these polyvinyl chloride (PVC), high density polyethylene (HDPE) and low density polyethylene (LDPE). Design/methodology/approach - Fly ash-based polymer matrix composites (FA-PMCs) were fabricated using hand layup method. Composites containing 100 g by weight fly ash particles, 100 g by weight brick dust particles and 50 g by weight chopped glass fiber particles were processed. Impact strength, compressive strength, tensile strength and flexural strength of composites have been measured and compared with PVC, HDPE and LDPE. Impact strength of the FA-PMC is higher than that of PVC, HDPE and LDPE. Structural analysis of pipes, gears and axial flow blade was verified using ANSYS. Barlou's condition for pipes, Lewis-Buckingham approach for gears and case-based analysis for axial flow blades were carried out and verified. Findings - Pipes, gears and axial flow blades made form fly ash-based composites were found to exhibit improved thermal resistance (i.e. better temperature independence for mechanical operations), higher impact strength and longer life compared to those made from PVC, HDPE and LDPE. Moreover, the eco-friendly nature of the raw materials used for fabricating the composite brings into its quiver a new dimension of appeal. Originality/value - Experimental investigation on the impact strength, compressive strength, tensile strength and flexural strength of fly ash-based green composites has not been attempted yet. © 2018 Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The need for alternative fuels in near future is mainly based on the renewable fuels in order to reduce the usage of conventional fuel. Research had already been done to utilise biodiesel to blend with diesel in percentages. Additionally emulsifier or an additive can be mixed with biodiesel blends to increase water tolerance and stability of the mixture. The concept of using biodiesel as an emulsifier for diesel and alcohol blends is recent trend. The rice bran oil was chosen and prepared with esterification process using acid and base catalyst which reduces molecular size there by reducing viscosity and boiling point. The biodiesel was tested with GC- MS (Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry) analysis also, so that the percentage of rice bran oil converted to esters has been found to ensure the purity. Rice bran oil is used here as an emulsifier for the diesel ethanol blend. The phase stability or retention time of diesel ethanol (DE) and diesel biodiesel ethanol (DBE) blends at different concentrations were experimentally observed. The concentrations were prepared with diesel and ethanol blends having 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% of ethanol with fixed 10% biodiesel on a volume basis and with various percentages of biodiesel blends having 6%, 8%, 10%, 12%, 14% keeping ethanol as 15% in the blend. The experimental results of the phase stability and retention time were analysed for these concentrations. © IAEME Publication.},

abstract={Biodiesel is a fuel comprised of mono-alkyl esters of long-chain fatty acids derived from vegetable oils or animal fats. Biodiesel is now well-adopted fuel with benefit of being a renewable energy source and decreasing pollutant. The cotton seed oil contains 18 - 26% and it contains long chain fatty acid. Cotton seed oil is rich in palmitic acid (22-26%), oleic acid (15-20%), linoleic acid (49-58%) and 10% mixture of other acid. The FFA present in the raw cotton seed oil is 3.7%. After transesterification, it is reduced to 1.9%. Similarly, the corresponding value of viscosity also is reduced from 34 Cst to 11.1 Cst. With the recent developments in the fuel injection system and more sophisticated components to meet emission norms, a good variety of fuels can be successfully used in Compression Ignition (CI) engines. Cotton seed oil can be easily blended with diesel in three different blends B10, B20 and B30. Initially the properties of cotton seed oil like calorific value, density, viscosity, %FFA, iodine value, and saponification value were identified and compared with diesel properties. A single cylinder, water cooled, direct injection CI engine at a constant engine speed of 1500 rpm was used for testing at various load conditions. The combustion and emission performance of the engine was obtained and compared with that of diesel. The effect of injection pressure on the engine performance was observed by varying the fuel injection pressure from 195 bar to 215 bar. From combustion analysis B30 blend seems to have better thermal efficiency compared to diesel at high loads. The NOx level was minimum for B30 blend and was better for all blends compared to diesel at high injection pressures. © IAEME Publication.},

abstract={One of the important issue related to the interconnection of Distributed Generation (DG) systems to grid is islanding. An active islanding detection technique (IDT), which employs Average Absolute Frequency Deviation Value (AFDVavg) for the detection of islanding condition, has been proposed in this work. The q-component of inverter's current is controlled using a current controller. A continuous and periodic signal is the reference signal for the current controller. At the point of common coupling (PCC), the deviation in the frequency is observed when the disturbances of frequency other than fundamental are injected during islanding. The active islanding detection method (IDM) provides lower NDZ (Non Detection Zone) compared to passive detection, thereby enhancing the detection of small deviation in the frequency at the PCC. By measuring the value of deviation in the frequency (AFDVavg), the condition for islanding is detected. The islanding condition is reconfirmed by the proposed technique. The reconfirmation of the islanding condition helps to eliminate the false detection of island due to non-islanding switching events. The effectiveness of the technique employed is analyzed with the help of simulation using MATLAB/ Simulink. © 2006-2018 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to determine the optimum level of geometrical parameters such as helix angle, nose radius, rake angle and machining parameters such as cutting speed, feed rate and depth of cut to arrive minimum surface roughness and tool wear during end milling of Al 356/SiC metal matrix composites (MMCs) using high speed steel end mill cutter. Design/methodology/approach: L27 Taguchi orthogonal design with six factors and three levels is employed for conducting experiments. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is carried out using Minitab16 software to find the influence of each input parameter on output performance measure. Grey-fuzzy logic multi optimisation algorithm is used to find the optimum level of the input parameters for minimum surface roughness and tool wear simultaneously. Findings: It is found that optimal combination of helix angle 40°, nose radius 0.8 mm, rake angle 12°, cutting speed 90 m/min, feed rate 0.04 mm/rev and depth of cut 1.5 mm have generated minimum surface roughness of 0.4063 µm and tool wear of 0.0375 mm. From ANOVA analysis, it is found that cutting speed influence is more on output performance followed by helix angle and rake angle compared with other machining and geometrical parameters. Originality/value: The influence of tool geometry during end milling of MMC using Grey-fuzzy logic algorithm has not been explored previously. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Solar energy plays a vital role in distributed generation system for micro grid applications. The interconnection of Photovoltaic (PV) systems with the grid is a difficult task and it requires multiple conditions to be satisfied. One of the major issues in grid connected PV system is islanding; it is a condition where distributed generation system supplies to local loads during grid failure condition. It also creates disturbances in controlling voltage and frequency at the point of common coupling and also degrades the power quality of grid connected PV system. Hence, islanding has to be detected by a suitable anti islanding technique which has faster detection time and smaller non detection zone. Anti islanding techniques are classified into active, passive and hybrid methods. When compared to passive techniques, the active islanding detection techniques have smaller non-detection zone but active methods are not easy to implement and reduces the power system quality. Passive methods are preferred for island detection with reduced non detection zone. This paper compares and analyzes five different passive methods for islanding detection viz. Over and Under Voltage, Current, Frequency (OUVIF) relays Rate of Change of Frequency (ROCOF) relays and Voltage Phase Shift Relays (VPSR) and suggests making them an integral part of islanding detection in the PV system. The proposed passive anti islanding techniques for islanding detection is tested for grid connected distributed generation system by simulation in MATLAB/Simulink platform. The response time of each technique for islanding detection is observed along with non detection zone and the fastest method is identified by comparing the response time of all proposed anti islanding techniques. © 2006-2018 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).},

abstract={Data mining refers to the extraction of meaningful knowledge from large data sources as it may contain hidden potential facts. In general the analysis of data mining can either be predictive or descriptive. Predictive analysis of data mining interprets the inference of the existing results so as to identify the future outputs and the descriptive analysis of data mining interprets the intrinsic characteristics or nature of the data. Clustering is one of the descriptive analysis techniques of data mining which groups the objects of similar types in such a way that objects in a cluster are closer to each other than the objects of other clusters. K-means is the most popular and widely used clustering algorithm that starts by selecting the k-random initial centroids as equal to number of clusters given by the user. It then computes the distance between initial centroids with the remaining data objects and groups the data objects into the cluster centroids with minimum distance. This process is repeated until there is no change in the cluster centroids or cluster members. But, still k-means has been suffered from several issues such as optimum number of k, random initial centroids, unknown number of iterations, global optimum solutions of clusters and more importantly the creation of meaningful clusters when dealing with the analysis of datasets from various domains. The accuracy involved with clustering should never be compromised. Thus, in this paper, a novel classification via clustering algorithm called Iterative Linear Regression Clustering with Percentage Split Distribution (ILRCPSD) is introduced as an alternate solution to the problems encountered in traditional clustering algorithms. The proposed algorithm is examined over an educational dataset to identify the hidden group of students having similar cognitive and competency skills. The performance of the proposed algorithm is well-compared with the accuracy of the traditional k-means clustering in terms of building meaningful clusters and to prove its real time usefulness. © 2016 Authors.},

abstract={The structural stability and electronic properties of zigzag graphdiyne nanosheet is studied using density functional theory (DFT) technique. The adsorption behavior of dimethyl amine (DMA) and trimethyl amine (TMA) vapor molecules on graphdiyne nanosheet are also investigated with DFT method. The density-of-states (DOS) spectrum gives the perception on charge transfer upon adsorption of DMA/TMA on graphdiyne nanosheet. The energy band gap changes upon the interaction of DMA/TMA vapors on graphdiyne nanosheet. The adsorption of DMA/TMA is studied in terms of Bader charge analysis, band gap, adsorption energy and average energy gap variation. A short recovery time is noticed on graphdiyne sensor upon desorption of DMA/TMA molecules. The most prominent adsorption sites of DMA/TMA on graphdiyne nanosheet are identified at an atomistic level. The interaction of DMA on graphdiyne nanosheet is observed to be more prominent rather than TMA vapor molecules. The findings of the present work clearly support the application of graphdiyne nanosheet for the detection of DMA/TMA vapor molecules. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={With the phenomenal growth of World Wide Web and the huge number of web sites with so many web pages, finding relevant information becomes quite difficult for the web users. Web site promoters also need to ensure that their web site is on the top of the search results for better market share. Finding the right combination of keywords and placing them at the appropriate places may help in bringing the web site on the top of search results when a search engine searches the web sites and creates indexes. Over the years web site optimization research has reported encouraging results. Despite promising results, data mining techniques for web sites classification have hardly been applied. An appropriate implementation of classification of web pages may help designing the web pages accordingly. Here in this work data mining using R’s web scraping technique has been used for performing extraction of web pages and also pair of java tools called “website” and “webscrap” were developed to automatically get pages and for further analysis of the downloaded pages.

abstract={In this work, a novel asymmetric dielectric modulated dual short gate (ADMDG) TFET is designed and their performance was analysed. The ADMDG TFET using silicon, germanium, and SiGe as channel and source materials were simulated and results are compared with conventional DGTFET. The device simulation has been performed using Sentaurus TCAD simulator. It is found that the proposed structure provides overall improved performance for silicon TFET such as higher on-current (Ion = 4.2 μA), smaller SS = 40mV/decade and maximum Ion/Ioff ratio (8.2 × 1010) compared to conventional DGTFET. The on-current values obtained for SiGe source, Ge source and Ge channel ADMDG TFET are 0.22 mA, 0.69 mA and 0.14 mA respectively compared to silicon ADMDG TFET but compromises other dc parameters such as SS and Ion/Ioff ratio. For CMOS circuits, the p-type silicon TFET of the proposed structure were also simulated and presented. Moreover, the proposed TFET structure is also simulated for different temperatures and its performance were compared and analysed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

The stability of bare and Ga substituted germanane nanosheet is substantiated with formation energy. The energy band gap opens upon hydrogenation on germanene sheet, which is utilized as a sensor material for the detection of NH3 and H2O molecules. The interaction of ammonia and humidity on germanane nanosheet is explored using the projected density of states, Bader charge transfer, adsorption energy, average energy gap variation, energy gap and electron density. The interaction of H2O and NH3 gas molecules on germanane material is studied in atomistic level.

abstract={Cardio-protective effect of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) against myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury (I/R) via preservation of mitochondria is well documented. But the distinct role of exogenous and endogenous H2S in cardio-protection and its dependency on functional cardiac mitochondria is not understood. The present study was designed to investigate the role of exogenous H2S preconditioning on cardiac mitochondrial subpopulation namely interfibrillar (IFM) and subsarcolemmal (SSM), in attenuating I/R injury in an isolated rat heart model in the absence of endogenous H2S production. The well-known inhibitor of endogenous H2S production DL-propargylglycine (cystathionine gamma lyase inhibitor) used for this purpose. Our previous studies revealed that NaSH (a H2S donor) preconditioning at a dose of 20 μM significantly reduced the infarct size and preserved the functional activities of IFM. However, this protective effect significantly declined, when the heart preconditioned with NaSH in the presence of PAG. Apparently, cardiac recovery was improved hemodynamically to a minimal level by increased concentration of NaSH (40 μM). The rat heart perfused with 2, 4 dinitrophenol a mitochondrial uncoupler, before NaSH preconditioning to understand the mitochondrial dependency of exogenous NaSH, we found that cardio-protective effect of NaSH was negated even with higher concentration of H2S. The result indicates that exogenous NaSH mediated cardio protection depends on functional cardiac mitochondria. However, no functional difference between the subpopulation i.e., interfibrillar and subsarcolemmal mitochondria observed with NaSH preconditioning in the presence of PAG. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS},

Numerical simulations were carried out for CEV and for CEV with undulations at Mach 3.0 and 7.0 for angles of attack ranging from −20° to +20° with increments of +5°. The results show that introduction of undulations did not have a significant impact on mono stability and lift-drag characteristics of the vehicle. It was also observed that introduction of undulations improved the aerothermodynamic characteristics of CEV. A reduction of about 36% in maximum heat flux at Mach 3.0 and about 21% at Mach 7.0 compared to the maximum heat flux for CEV was observed. © 2017 IAA},

abstract={The electronic properties of MnFe2O4 nanostructure including the adsorption behavior of six possible adsorption sites of acetone vapors on MnFe2O4 base material are investigated using the first-principles technique. The adsorption behavior of acetone vapors on MnFe2O4 material was studied using Bader charge transfer, energy band gap, average-energy-gap variation and adsorption energy. The most suitable adsorption sites of acetone vapor molecules on MnFe2O4 nanostructure are studied at an atomistic level. The structural stability of MnFe2O4 nanostructure is ascertained in terms of formation energy. The density-of-states (DOS) spectrum provides the perception of electronic properties of MnFe2O4 nanostructure. The energy band gap and DOS evidently supports the adsorption of acetone molecules on MnFe2O4 nanostructure. The changes in the energy band gap and density of states are noticed upon the interaction of acetone vapors on MnFe2O4 nanostructure. The DOS spectrum shows the variation in peak maxima due to the electron transmission between acetone vapor molecules and MnFe2O4 material. The interaction of hydrogen atom in an acetone molecule onto an oxygen atom in MnFe2O4 is noticed to be a more favorable site rather than other interaction sites. The finding reveals that MnFe2O4 adsorbate surface could be efficiently utilized to check the presence of acetone vapors in the environment. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2017.},

abstract={Optimal Reactive Power Dispatch (ORPD) plays an important role for the secure and reliable operation of power systems. The main purpose of ORPD is to find the settings of control variables such as voltage rating of generators, reactive power injection of VAr compensators and tap ratios of the tap setting transformers in order to minimize the total active power losses of the network while satisfying a given set of constraints. In this paper, Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS) controllers such as Static Var Compensator (SVC), Thyristor Controlled Series Capacitor (TCSC) and Thyristor Controlled Phase Shifting Transformer (TCPST) are considered in addition with the conventional ORPD control variables for additional active power loss minimization. The whole ORPD problem is considered as a non-linear multi-modal optimization problem. Harmony search algorithm is a recent meta-heuristic algorithm which mimics the musician’s improvization process. In this paper, two versions of harmony search algorithm, namely Basic Harmony Search Algorithm (HSA) and Improved Harmony Search Algorithm (IHSA) are applied to solve conventional ORPD, as well as ORPD considering FACTS devices. Studies on the proposed algorithm are carried out on IEEE 14 and 57 bus systems. Comparison of simulation results reveals the effectiveness of proposed algorithms over other well-established population-based optimization techniques. © 2018 The Author(s).

Slump flow, L-box and V-funnel tests were conducted to study the flow characteristics of SCC. Compressive strength, split tensile strength, and flexural strength tests were performed to assess the strength characteristics. It was observed that the SCC with 10% replacement of cement with Alccofine showed better results than the other mixes. Further, the modification of the optimum blend with 10% Alccofine was made by adding variable percentages (0.5%, 1% and 1.5% by volume) of micro steel fibres and strength tests were conducted to optimise the fibre content. The strength degradation of the SCC with optimum Alccofine and fibre content exposed to alkaline, chloride and sulphate solutions was also studied. © 2018 Authors.},

abstract={Electroencephalogram (EEG) sign is the recording of impulsive electrical interest of the mind over a small period of time. Signals are made through attack of neurons in the brains that are measured and calculated through EEG. EEG indicators are low voltage indicators that are contaminated with the aid of various types of noises that are additionally known as artifacts. As these alerts are used to diagnose diverse varieties of mind related diseases like narcolepsy, Sleep apneasyndrome, Insomnia and parasomnia it will become necessary to make those indicators free from noise for correct evaluation and detection of the sicknesses. Various noise elimination strategies together with ICA-Independent Component Analysis, PCA-Principle Component Analysis, Wavelet packet transform and Wavelet Packet Transform are to be had and can be carried out in mat lab. All these strategies may be used for EEG signal de-noising through noise to the original sign and then put in force the noise reduction method and their overall performance can be evaluated based on the elements which includes SNR and MSE. In this article, an arithmetical method for putting off artifacts from EEG demos via wavelet packet transform without thinking about SNR calculation is proposed. © 2018, Editorial office of Journal of International Pharmaceutical Research.

abstract={Lot of discussion is happening about the role of financial products and markets in improving livability standard of people and real economic activity. In Western nations such as the U.S., debate is on the financial sector becoming inefficiently huge and has been providing complex products to consumers like households and firms, whereas in many emerging and developing nations, there has been a significant push to increase the usage of financial products. Indian banking industry has attained substantial improvements in all the areas relating to financial feasibility, profitability and competitiveness and has depicted growth in branch and ATMs penetration in the last few decades. Despite these success and efforts, banks were not been able to pull the vast segment of the populace especially the underprivileged into the basic banking services. The paper finds out how far the commercial banks are able to overcome the barriers such as the lack of reach, mounting cost of transactions and time taken in providing those services to people with a special focus on select villages from Southern part of India. This paper also studies the key drivers of financial inclusion (FI) by using micro and regional data to understand the crucial factors that could stimulate FI. © 2019, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc..

The process of designing ornithopter involves flapping mechanism. The ornithopter developed is subjected to an investigation involving the analysis of flapping rate under various operating conditions. The analysis of flapping rate involving ornithopter is a novel approach, as the research related to this area is found to be very limited. The variation in number of turns winded up for three possible trials have been performed for the elastic band in the ornithopter with and without the application of lubricant. The time and flapping rate for each trial has been measured and influence effects were analysed from the average time and flapping rate. It was found that the maximum number of turns were increased from 100 to 200, in the case of elastic band with lubrication. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Cinnamomum wightii is an endemic species of the Western Ghats, India and is used in Ayurveda and Siddha systems of medicine. Its bark and leaves are adulterated with commercial cinnamon in southern India. Despite its medicinal and commercial importance, the species remains underexplored. The objective of the present work was to screen the chemical composition, in vitro antioxidant, α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibitory activities of the leaf essential oil of C. wightii collected from different populations. GC-FID and GC-MS analyses of the leaf essential oils from seven accessions enabled the identification of a total of 70 constituents, of which only 16 compounds were present in all samples. Eleven major constituents (> 5%) were identified, of which only linalool and spathulenol were present in all accessions as major constituents. Among seven accessions, essential oil from Parson's valley, Nilgiris exhibited better antioxidant activity with IC50 values of 2.552 ± 0.13 and 3.485 ± 0.09 mg/mL for ABTS and DPPH respectively. The essential oil from Korakundah, Nilgiris showed better hypoglycemic activity with IC50 values of 1.617 ± 0.02 and 1.146 ± 0.02 mg/mL for α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibitory activities respectively. The leaf essential oils of C. wightii may be used in nutraceutical products focusing diabetes mellitus as the moderate inhibition of the metabolic enzymes has the advantage of slow release of glucose. © 2018 Natural Product Incorporation.},

abstract={A theoretical study is conducted for magnetohydrodynamic pumping of electroosmotic non-Newtonian physiological nanoliquids through a two-dimensional microfluidic channel. The Sutterby rheological nanofluid model is utilized to characterize the liquid. The normalized two-dimensional conservation equations for mass, longitudinal and transverse momentum, energy and solutal concentration are reduced with lubrication approximations (long wavelength and low Reynolds number assumptions). A coordinate transformation is employed to map the unsteady problem from the wave laboratory frame to a steady problem in the wave frame. Slip and convective conditions are imposed at the channel walls. The emerging boundary value problem is solved numerically using MATLAB software. The flow is effectively controlled by many geometric parameters, viz., electroosmosis, Hartmann and Sutterby fluid parameters. It is observed from the analysis that the rise in magnetic and electroosmosis effects leads to a reduction in the axial velocity field. The radiation parameter decreases the temperature for the positive value of Joule heating parameter and the trend is revered for the negative Joule heating parameter. This study is encouraged by exploring the nanofluid dynamics in peristaltic transport as symbolized by heat transport in biological flows, novel pharmacodynamics pumps and gastrointestinal motility enhancement. The study is also relevant to MHD biomimetic blood pumps. © 2018, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.},

abstract={In recent years, internet technologies and its rapid growth have created a paradigm of digital services. In this new digital world, users suffer due to the information overload problem and the recommender systems are widely used as a decision support tool to address this issue. Though recommender systems are proven personalization tool available, the need for the improvement of its recommendation ability and efficiency is high. Among various recommendation generation mechanisms available, collaborative filtering-based approaches are widely utilized to produce similarity-based recommendations. To improve the recommendation generation process of collaborative filtering approaches, clustering techniques are incorporated for grouping users. Though many traditional clustering mechanisms are employed for the users clustering in the existing works, utilization of bio-inspired clustering techniques needs to be explored for the generation of optimal recommendations. This article presents a new bio-inspired clustering ensemble through aggregating swarm intelligence and fuzzy clustering models for user-based collaborative filtering. The presented recommendation approaches have been evaluated on the real-world large-scale datasets of Yelp and TripAdvisor for recommendation accuracy and stability through standard evaluation metrics. The obtained results illustrate the advantageous performance of the proposed approach over its peer works of recent times. © 2018, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Hypergraphs are tools for matching of point-features incorporating spatial relationships in the form of hyperedges exhibiting topological and geometric features between the points of images to be matched. Considering all possible hyperedges is computationally expensive and are randomly chosen in the state of the art techniques. A Helly Hypergraph based Matching Framework (HHMF) is proposed for the matching of images using point-features with effective hyperedges. The framework includes proposed algorithms such as Construction of Hyperedges using Point-features by Random (CHPR), Combinatorial (CHPC), and Exhaustive (CHPE) sampling techniques with and without Helly selection. The resultant hyperedges are treated with Adaptive Block Co-ordinate Ascent Graph Matching with Integer Projected Fixed Point algorithm. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated in terms of Accuracy, Matching score, Execution time and Tensor Size for synthetic point sets and Willow wine image dataset. Based on the experimental studies carried out against existing framework, CHPC, and CHPE with Helly selection, exhibited better performance with 73.88% & 81% accuracy for 53.64 & 14.8% reduced tensor size respectively, in deformation noise tests, and 98% & 96% accuracy for 97% & 70% reduced tensor size in outlier tests. In the implicit experimental comparisons within sampling techniques, CHPR, and CHPE provided better performance with 81.37%, and 76% accuracy. In general, HHMF framework has reduced the tensor size and execution time for deterministic sampling cases during point sets matching. The framework can be extended in the near future by incorporating learning schemes for automated hypergraph based point sets matching. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={We present PromoterPredict, a dynamic multiple regression approach to predict the strength of Escherichia coli promoters binding the s 70 factor of RNA polymerase. s 70 promoters are ubiquitously used in recombinant DNA technology, but characterizing their strength is demanding in terms of both time and money. We parsed a comprehensive database of bacterial promoters for the -35 and -10 hexamer regions of s 70 -binding promoters and used these sequences to construct the respective position weight matrices (PWM). Next we used a well-characterized set of promoters to train a multivariate linear regression model and learn the mapping between PWM scores of the -35 and -10 hexamers and the promoter strength. We found that the log of the promoter strength is significantly linearly associated with a weighted sum of the -10 and -35 sequence profile scores. We applied our model to 100 sets of 100 randomly generated promoter sequences to generate a sampling distribution of mean strengths of random promoter sequences and obtained a mean of 6E-4 ± 1E-7. Our model was further validated by cross-validation and on independent datasets of characterized promoters. PromoterPredict accepts -10 and -35 hexamer sequences and returns the predicted promoter strength. It is capable of dynamic learning from user-supplied data to refine the model construction and yield more robust estimates of promoter strength. PromoterPredict is available as both a web service (https://promoterpredict.com) and standalone tool (https://github.com/PromoterPredict). Our work presents an intuitive generalization applicable to modelling the strength of other promoter classes. Copyright © 2018 Bharanikumar et al.},

abstract={Knowledge on dry and wet periods of a region or station is essential for effective formulation of policies for water use, agriculture and economics. Dry and wet periods are the recurrent features for the majority of India and those areas depend on monsoon rainfall to fulfil domestic, industrial, and agricultural water requirements. Rainfall varies both in space and time and causes dry and wet periods. These dry and wet periods are generally assessed using drought indicators. The objectives of the present research are (a) to evaluate such periods for Thanjavur city using Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Statistical Z-score index and China Z-index, and (b) to make comparisons of these indicators in different time-scales. The results of the study indicate that China Z-index and Statistical Z-score are close to each other for annual and seasonal rainfall data and they are different from SPI. Monthly moisture categorizations based on these three indicators are distinct from each other. Further, the study confirms that China-Z-index is more appropriate to address the moisture category for those periods in which the rainfall is highly erratic. © 2018, © 2018 Indian Society for Hydraulics.},

abstract={Background: The treatment of epilepsy using antiepileptogenic drugs is complicated by drug resistance, resulting in treatment failure in more than one-third of cases. Human P-glycoprotein (hPGP; MDR1) is a known epileptogenic mediator. Methods: Given that experimental investigations have suggested a role for pharmacogenetics in this treatment failure, it would be of interest to study hPGP polymorphisms that might contribute to the emergence of drug resistance. Changes in protein functional activity could result from mutations as well as altered abundance. Bioinformatics approaches were used to assess and rank the functional impact of 20 missense MDR1 polymorphisms and the top five were selected. The structures of the wildtype and variant hPGP were modelled based on the mouse PGP structure. Docking studies of the wildtype and variant hPGP with four standard anti-epileptic drugs were carried out. Results: Our results revealed that the drug binding site with respect to the wildtype protein was uniform. However, the variant hPGP proteins displayed a repertoire of binding sites with stronger binding affinities towards the drug. Conclusion: Our studies indicated that specific polymorphisms in MDR1 could drive conformational changes of PGP structure, facilitating altered contacts with drug-substrates and thus modifying their bioavailability. This suggests that MDR1 polymorphisms could actively contribute to the emergence of pharmaco-resistance in antiepileptic therapy. © 2018 Varghese and Palaniappan.},

abstract={The process parameters of the laser hardened zone play a vital role in determining the surface hardness of the material after the hardening process. The most influencing input parameters such as laser power and traveling speed are considered in conducting the experimental work. The ultimate aim is to obtain maximum hardness, minimum width, and maximum depth after the laser surface hardening (LSH). The desired output responses are obtained by optimizing the process parameters and suggesting it for future research to eliminate the unnecessary trials. Trial and error procedures of finding out the optimal conditions incur more time and effort. Thus, the optimization was carried out using the non-conventional technique, elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). The laser surface hardening was carried out on the low alloy steel using fiber laser source. The experimental trials were designed using response surface methodology (RSM), and the mathematical equations were developed using regression analysis. The mathematical models are utilized by the NSGA-II algorithm by conducting ‘n’ iterations for ‘m’ population levels to find out the optimized zone for performing the hardening process. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.},

Rotating disk’s outer and inner radius ratio, b/a, material property gradient index, n, thickness index, m, angular speed, w, the temperature difference, T and constraints at the inner and outer surface of the rotating disk are included as the control parameters. These parameters are varied to three levels of value, and the L27 orthogonal matrix is used. The twenty-seven cases are analyzed through FEA technique, and as an outcome, maximum stress and displacement are determined. From the multi-objective optimization, the best value for the control parameters is identified as b/a = 2; n = 1; m = 0; speed = 5000 rpm; temperature difference = 300 °C and clamped constraint at inner and outer surface of rotating disk and the corresponding maximum stress = 0.567 Mpa, deflection = 0.113 μm, and mass = 0.84 kg. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.},

abstract={Gear is an essential power transmitting element used extensively in all kinds of machines, and among the many gear types, involute spur gear is comparatively simple to design and manufacture. However, predominant failure occurs at the gear root portion as a consequence of high bending stress. Several research works have been done in replacing the gear materials to reduce the stress and to improve the load carrying capacity. In this context, this study employs a functionally graded material (FGM) for the gear tooth and the respective stress analysis is carried out through finite element analysis (FEA) technique. The finite element analysis method is verified for grid independence and validated with benchmark problem. FGM materials, namely Al–SiC, Al–Si 3 N 4 , Al–Al 2 O 3 , Al–Steel, Steel–Zirconia are included in this investigation, and the variation in the material property is considered in the radial direction as exponential, linear, elliptical and power law equations. As an outcome of the analysis, the variation of stress, strain and displacement is documented for various FGM materials and the best equation for the material property variation is identified under uniform and varying face width value of gear tooth. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.},

abstract={The demand for high performance gas sensors in IoT applications is of great interest. Gas sensors with high sensitivity and selectivity at room temperature have been expected for practical applications. However, the limitations of conventional metal oxide based sensing materials and unstable outputs caused by ambient environments significantly restrict their practical applications. Herein, we have demonstrated for the first time a heptazine based microporous polymer sensor for the detection of ammonia at room temperature and under ambient conditions. The chemiresistive sensor performance for ammonia was investigated over a wide concentration range (1-200 ppm) and in the presence of a relative humidity range (23-85% RH). The presence of active sites (CN and NH groups) and the porous network of a heptazine gas sensor enables an enhanced response (16.6 at 70% RH and 47 at 84% RH) towards 50 ppm of ammonia with response and recovery times of 65 and 9 s, respectively. The electron withdrawing nature of heptazine enables better selectivity towards ammonia over other VOC analytes. Therefore, we believe that the developed sensing material presents an excellent opportunity for the development of high performance, portable, easy-to-use devices for disease diagnosis via breath analysis and environmental monitoring under ambient conditions. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

Therefore, it is altogether a difficult, too time-consuming, and much tiresome work, exclusively to the newcomers in this field. Therefore, this paper focuses on providing the list of popular databases available belonging to the neurological signals, brain signal/image collections, and so on. The count and the kinds of attacks across the networked computer systems have hiked the significance of computer network security. At present, network administrators use to inspect, examine, scrutinize, review, and analyze the network traffic to figure out what is going on and to set up a prompt response in the event of an identified attack. This paper analyzes the different sweep techniques such as Ping sweep, TCP sweep, and Null sweep on the popular databases about the brain signal/image collections.

abstract={Internet of Things (IOT) is a sophisticated system where day-to-day life becomes easier with the new and smarter technologies enabling more intelligent processing and communication between devices. IoT while is at its development phase, has already been regarded as the future solutions for connecting devices. In precise, IoT is “the family of technologies whose aim is to connect a device to internet and enjoy all the features through the network”. It is the possible technology that can possibly bridge all the boundaries to provide an easier means of remote access. The problem with the conventional methodologies is the lack of proper Architecture at present. This lack is preventing the use to a greater means. Hence IoT is expected to bridge all those shortcomings with its new centric features. The IoT architectures are more welcomed to facilitate the developer’s needs.

This approach uses Meyer Wavelet decomposition to extract the motion artifact, which is subsequently utilized as the reference input of an adaptive filter for noise cancellation. The technique diminishes the overhead of the circuit because it does not need a separate collection of reference input signal which link to noise. Testing results illustrate that this approach can efficiently remove motion artifact and make better the signal quality. © 2018 Authors.},

The additional functionalities which are unique to the proposed system is to (i) export the available active power from renewable energy sources to the grid, (ii) compensate long term PQ problems, (iii) compensate voltage interruption. Additionally, the dc-link voltage of the system is controlled by using the proposed AFPI controller to effectively improve the dynamic performance of the system during disturbances. Unlike conventional PI controller, in the proposed controller, the gains are not fixed. It is dynamically adjusted by the fuzzy logic-based intelligent supervisory control system according to system operating conditions.

abstract={Candle filter filters the contaminated water by blocking the contaminants having size greater than filter’s pore size. It is possible to remove bacteria, protozoa, and microbial cysts through this filter, but it is not effective against viruses as its size is smaller than the pore size of filter. If the filter consists of the certain amount of silver in a form that will not leach away can kill or incapacitate bacteria and also it stops the development of algae in the filter surface. The effectiveness of such filter depends on the pore structure and its distribution. The microstructure and morphological character of candle material provides the under-laying mechanism on effectiveness of the candle. The characteristics of candle filter can be measured based on its density, abrasion resistance, surface area, average pore size, pore size distribution, pore shape, pore volume, and surface chemistry of activated carbon. In the present work, pore size distribution and surface chemistry are taken as prime focus for study. From the analysis, it is evident that existence of complicated path for water to flow and it makes to retain the particle on the surface of filter. Since the pore size of the candle is being less than 40nm, it can be effective in removal of E-Coli bacteria from water as the size of E-Coli bacteria is 2µm. © 2018, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc..

abstract={The role of image encryption in secure communication of confidential images is quite significant and novel schemes to encrypt images always have a demand in the scientific research community. DNA coding has found a noteworthy position in various earlier proposed image encryption schemes because of its simple but effective diffusion capabilities. Similar to the DNA coding, novel coding technique based on an aphorism present in the Sanskrit literature has been utilized in this image encryption work. The utility of Sanskrit sūtra ‘yamātārājabhānasalagam (YRBS)’ for performing scrambling, substitution and cyclic bit shifting promises the usage of this scheme as a part of various image encryption solutions. In this approach, YRBS coding has been employed along with simple one dimensional logistic map for encrypting 256 × 256 grayscale test images. The suggested scheme possesses a keyspace of 4.3769 × 10 46 and average correlation figures of −0.00021, −0.00021, −0.00015 in horizontal, vertical and diagonal directions respectively when applied on ten test images. The encrypted pixels passed the NIST Test suite and this approach also offers a good resistance to chosen cipher text attack which was a challenge in DNA coding. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Owing to its integration with cyber, Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is susceptible to integrity attacks, thereby inflicting fatal consequences both in industrial and economic domains. Compared to traditional networks, IIoT based on Software Defined Network (SDN) provides various network security enhancements thereby decreasing the effects of the integrity attacks. In an industrial process, anomaly detection with negligible false positives is the ideal intrusion detection mode, where the prerequisite of storing the attack patterns or acquiring the exhaustive knowledge of the devices in IIoT is not required. This research is an extension of our previous work, which employed a hybrid of specification and anomaly detection methods to recognize anomalies of critical components from a water treatment test bed at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD). The proposed work defines invariants for all the processes of the test bed. Any conflict from the invariants is notified as an intrusion and the compromised device is identified. The validation is done through Mininet tool with the testbed dataset. Out of the 30 successful attacks, this effort discovers 29 attacks with the detection rate of 96.5% and false positive rate of 6.5%. © 2018 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.},

To investigate the effect of dry sliding wear parameters such as sliding distance, percentage reinforcement, load, sliding velocity and temperature on wear rate and co-efficient of friction, experiments were conducted using a pin on disc wear tester as per Taguchi’s orthogonal array design and the tribological behaviour of synthesized composites was investigated by statistical techniques. Significance and the influence of the parameters over the response were determined by analysis of variances and grey relational analysis was used to find the optimal combination of parameters to obtain minimum wear rate and co-efficient of friction. © 2018 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={The design development and control of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV's) have stimulated great significance in the automatic control research for the past 2 decade. In specific, Quad rotor systems are promising platform in the area of UAV research, due to its simple in construction, maintenance, ability to hover, and their vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) capability. The dynamics and control of quad rotor are highly non-linear and under actuated so it is consider as a test-rig to verify any new proposed nonlinear control algorithm. Dif-ferent control algorithms were proposed and implemented to stabilize the UAV attitude, and altitude. Adaptive control and navigation algorithms also implemented in UAV platform to ensure the maneuvering against the internal and external disturbances.

abstract={This paper presents a new decision-making framework called cloud vendor selector (CVS) for effective selection of cloud vendors by mitigating the challenge of unreasonable criteria weight assignment and improper management of uncertainty. The CVS comprises of two stages where, in the first stage, decision-makers’ intuitionistic fuzzy-valued preferences are aggregated using newly proposed extended simple Atanassov’s intuitionistic weighted geometry operator. Further, in the second stage, criteria weights are estimated by using newly proposed intuitionistic fuzzy statistical variance method and finally, ranking of cloud vendor (CV) is done using newly proposed three-way VIKOR method under intuitionistic fuzzy environment which introduces neutral category along with cost and benefit for better understanding the nature of criteria. An illustrative example of CV selection is demonstrated to show the practicality and usefulness of the proposed framework. Finally, the strength and weakness of the proposal are realized from both theoretic and numeric context by comparison with other methods. © 2018, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.},

abstract={Abstract: Biosorbents from the biomass of Jatropha sp. (JES), Ricinus sp. (RES) and Pongamia sp. (PES) biodiesel extracted seeds were used in natural form for the elimination of hexavalent chromium. The study performed by varying the parameters of biosorbents size, solution pH, biosorbents dosage, metal concentration, contact time and temperature. The equilibrium data were correlated with two parameter isotherm models. Biosorption isotherm modeling showed that the biosorption data better explained by the Langmuir isotherm model with maximum monolayer biosorption capacities of 28.57, 19.60 and 27.77 mg/g for JES, RES and PES, respectively. The applicability of pseudo-second-order kinetics was observed in all the three biosorbents. The results of thermodynamic analysis showed that the biosorption of Cr(VI) ions onto JES, RES and PES was spontaneous in nature. Cr(VI)-loaded biosorbents were evaluated for a recycle studies with 0.1 M NaOH solution. Experiments conducted using Cr(VI) solution along with the coexisting ions demonstrated that the presence of co-ions slightly reduced the biosorption capacities of the JES and RES. Results of current research demonstrated that the JES, RES and PES could be used for the elimination of hexavalent chromium from aqueous system.

abstract={Affective computing is gaining paramount importance in ensuring the better and effective human–machine interaction. As glottal and speech signals depict the characteristics of the emotional nature of the speaker in addition to the linguistic information, speaker’s emotions are needed to be recognised to give meaningful response by the system. This paper emphasises the effectiveness and efficiency in selecting the energy features by passing the speech through the Gamma tone filters spaced in Equivalent rectangular bandwidth (ERB), MEL and BARK scale. Various modelling techniques are used to develop the robust multi-speaker independent speaker’s emotion/stress recognition system. Since EMO-DB Berlin database and SAVEE emotional audio-visual database used in this work contain the only limited set of speech utterances uttered by 10/4 actors/speakers in different emotions, it has become challenging to improve the performance of the stress/emotion recognition system. Speaker independent emotion recognition is done by extracting the Gamma tone energy features and cepstral features by passing the concatenated speech considered for training through the Gamma tone filters spaced in ERB, MEL and BARK scales. Subsequently, VQ/Fuzzy clustering models and continuous density hidden Markov models are created for all emotions and evaluation is done with the utterances of a speaker independent of speeches considered for training. The proposed features for test utterances are captured and applied to the VQ/Fuzzy/MHMM/SVM models and testing is performed by using minimum distance criterion/maximum log-likelihood criterion. The proposed Gamma tone energy/cepstral features and modelling techniques provide complementary evidence in assessing the performance of the system. This algorithm offers 96%, 79%, and 95.3% as weighted accuracy recall for the stress recognition system with respect to the classification done on emotion-specific group VQ/Fuzzy/MHMM/SVM models for GTF energy features with Gamma tone filters spaced in ERB, MEL and BARK scale respectively for the system evaluated for the EMO-DB database. Weighted accuracy recall is found to be 91%, 93% and 94% for the classification done on emotion-specific group models for GTF energy features with Gamma tone filters spaced in ERB, MEL and BARK scale respectively for the evaluation done on the utterances chosen from the SAVEE database. Gamma tone Cepstral features provide the overall accuracy of 92%, 90% and 92% for filters spaced in ERB, MEL and BARK scale for Berlin EMO-DB. Decision level fusion classification based on GTF energy features and modelling techniques provides the overall accuracy as 99.8% for EO-DB database and 100% for SAVEE database. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Earlier the methods adopted for the repair and rehabilitation were the external bonding of the damaged component with steel fibers and steel jackets. But the major problem that caused due to this steel components is corrosion. Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) composite materials used for strengthening of components in the form of confinement is of considerable importance in civil engineering. This paper presents the results of axially loaded RC short columns which are strengthened by providing confinement with new material BFRP. The primary objective of this work is to examine the load carrying capacity of concrete columns confined with basalt fiber reinforced polymer jacket (BFRP) which is considered as an abstruse material for strengthening. BFRP materials are non-corrosive, non-magnetic, and chemical resistant and they are progressively being used for repair, rehabilitation, and strengthening of structures that are not stable enough to carry loads. The parameters considered in the study are full and partial wrapping and the number of layers of confinement. The results obtained from the experimental studies and the analytical models precisely shows that the BFRP confinements will upgrade the compressive strength of columns under the given load condition. © 2018 Authors.},

abstract={Lactate serves as a biomarker for a plethora of microbial contamination in cow milk. In this context, a novel nickel-metal organic framework (Ni-MOF) modified platinum electrode was fabricated for the effective and reliable detection of lactate in cow milk samples. The Ni-MOF of mean size 12 μm in length and 0.7 nm in width was synthesized by an inexpensive mild solution method. The Ni-MOF modified platinum, platinum wire and Ag/AgCl were employed as the working, counter and reference electrodes to design a potentiostatic three-electrode configuration device. The developed Ni-MOF modified platinum electrode exhibits good sensitivities (106.617 and 29.533 μA mM-1) towards lactate over the wide linear ranges of 0.01-0.9 and 1-4 mM with a correlation coefficient of R2 = 0.99, a detection limit of 5 μM, a repeatability of 0.57% RSD and a stability of 95.3% for 20 days. The nano-flower like morphology of Ni-MOF provides accessible sites for the electro-oxidation of lactate and thereby high sensitivity to lactate. Furthermore, the developed electrode remained free from potential interfering species and thus provides a promising tool for rapid detection of lactate in cow milk samples. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.},

abstract={Nanocrystalline MnCO3 is synthesized by hydrothermal reduction of KMnO4 using different amounts of pyrrole. The effect of molar ratio of KMnO4:pyrrole on the phase purity, size of the particle, textural and capacitance properties of MnCO3 is studied systematically using various physico-chemical and electrochemical techniques. While X-ray diffraction studies confirm decline in the phase purity of MnCO3, FTIR, Raman spectroscopic and thermogravimetric studies reveal an increase in the amount of adsorbed water and residual carbon content on increasing the pyrrole concentration during the synthesis. An increase in the size of the particles and reduction in the number of mesopores are observed from the morphological and sorption studies on increasing the pyrrole concentration during the synthesis. A highest specific capacitance value of 296 F g−1 is obtained at a current density of 0.16 A g−1 for the nanocrystalline MnCO3, and this capacitance value found to decrease on increasing the concentration of pyrrole during the synthesis of nanocrystalline MnCO3 (166 and 140 F g−1 for the KMnO4:pyrrole ratio of 1:1 and 1:2, respectively). © 2018 The Electrochemical Society.},

abstract={During the recent years, researchers are attempting to fly Mini Aerial Vehicles (MAV) in highly unconventional missions and constrained space. As a result, the Angle of Attack (AOA) becomes a very critical quantity for operating the aircraft. But the angle of attack is not directly measured by adding separate sensor units in MAVs due to weight constraint. The present note establishes a simple method for estimation of the angle of attack. This method involves converting the dynamical system equation into a nonlinear algebraic equation by separating the pitch rate. This nonlinear algebraic equation is then solved for the angle of attack capturing gross steady state. Later, pitch rate is added to the above algebraic solution to capture the dynamics. This note presents the error statistics of the estimated angle of attack and the estimate exhibits an accuracy of around 4º to 6º. The simulations were carried out with and without considering sensor drift of 1º per second in the gyro measurements. © 2018},

abstract={Introduction: The present study focuses on in silico docking of phytocompounds eugenol and vanillin from the plant Vernonia arborea against mitogen-activated protein kinase-I (MAPK-I) (PDB ID – 4U7Z) to assess their anti-inflammatory potential. Materials and Methods: Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis was carried out on the ethanolic leaf extract of V. arborea and the phytoconstituents present was identified after comparison with the NIST library. In silico analysis of the selected compounds was done by AutoDock software. Indomethacin was used as the reference compound for the study. Results: The results showed that eugenol interacted with the amino acid residues MET106 and ASP104 in the active site of MAPK-I with a bond length of 1.864 Å and 1.8 Å, respectively, and the IC50 value of this compound was found to be 3.21 (µm). The second ligand, vanillin showed interactions with the amino acid residues MET106, THR 108, and LYS112 with a bond length of 1.991 Å, 2.243 Å, and 2.166 Å, and the IC50 value was 3.29 (µm). Indomethacin showed interactions with methionine and lysine at a bond length of 2.165 Å and 2.007 Å with an IC50 value of 9.21 (µm). Discussion and Conclusion: The ligands formed an effective hydrogen bonding with the chosen target and the bonds formed were well within the range of &gt;1.5 Å and &lt;3.2 Å. The median inhibitory concentration values of the selected phytocompounds were also a proof of their superior anti-inflammatory potential when compared to indomethacin. Based on these promising preliminary in silico results, further in vitro and in vivo experiments can be planned to evaluate the anti-inflammatory activity of V. arborea. © 2018 BRNSS Publication Hub.

abstract={A detailed experimental and theoretical investigation on the intermolecular interactions in (Z)-3-(4-halophenyl)-2-(pyridin-2/3/4-yl)acrylonitriles is reported. The intermolecular interactions are analyzed and quantified by PIXEL, DFT and quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) calculations. The results showed that the absence of strong classical hydrogen bonds and the presence of several weak intermolecular C-H⋯N, C-H⋯halogen, halogen⋯halogen and π stacking interactions play important roles in the stabilization of crystal structures. Four different π stacking dimers (homo parallel, homo slipped parallel, hetero anti-parallel and hetero anti-parallel slipped) are observed and found to be the most stabilized dimeric motifs in all structures. The hetero anti-parallel (-10.6 kcal mol-1) and slipped anti-parallel (-9.1 kcal mol-1) π⋯π interactions have the highest stabilization energies among the other interactions observed in the present study. The substituted halogen atoms (X = F, Cl and Br) are involved in the variant and invariant C-H⋯X, C⋯X and halogen⋯halogen interactions in all three families. The relative contributions of various non-covalent interactions are calculated using Hirshfeld surface analysis and 2D fingerprint plots. Further, detailed UV-vis spectral studies are reported for the title compounds in solution and solid phases. These results are compared with the simulated spectra and good agreement is found between experimental and theoretical spectra. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={Electrocodeposition is acknowledged as superior technique for preparation metallic and alloy based composite coatings with enhanced properties. In this study an attempt has been made to deposit micron sized chromium particles in nickel matrix by electrocodeposition principles. The electrocodeposition setup is established and the composite coatings are prepared from watts type nickel bath. The experiments are framed by robust experimental design of Taguhci's orthogonal array approach. The process parameters are considered for study and the L27 orthogonal array is chosen for experimental design. The Ni-Cr composite coatings are prepared over mild steel substrates. The outcomes, mass of deposit, area fractions of particles and microhardness of particles are evaluated methodically. The presence of Cr particles in nickel matrix is examined with SEM, XRD and EDS studies. The direct effects of electrodeposition process variables on microhardness of Ni-Cr thin film coatings are investigated with signal to noise ratio, mean effects and analysis of variances. Base on the significances the parameters are ranked by order. It has been revealed that current density has the predominant effects on microhardness of Ni-Cr and authenticated with scientific and statistical investigations.

abstract={This work aims at investigating the effect of oxygen enriched combustion with water injection at the intake on engine's performance, emission and combustion characteristics of a MO (mahua oil) fueled diesel engine. Initially, experiments were conducted with ND (neat diesel) and neat MO as fuels under variable power output conditions. Subsequently experiments were followed with MO as fuel with different oxygen concentrations such as 21.8%, 22.4%, 23.8% and 24.7% by volume. The optimal oxygen concentration was found based on the engine's BTE (brake thermal efficiency) as 23.8%. At the optimal oxygen concentration water injection was carried out at 1%, 2%, 3% and 4% by volume. The optimal amount of water injection was obtained as 2%. A comparative study was made for the optimal oxygen concentration and optimal water injection conditions. The maximum BTE was noted as 25.4% and 32.8% with neat MO and ND respectively at the maximum engine power output. However, oxygen enrichment increased the BTE with all concentrations and reached the maximum value of 30.6% at 23.8% oxygen enrichment at the maximum power output of 3.7 kW. The smoke, HC (hydrocarbon) and CO (carbon monoxide) emissions were significantly reduced with oxygen enrichment. At peak power output the smoke value was noted as 48% with 23.8% oxygen enrichment whereas it was 67% and 40% with neat MO and ND. However, oxygen enrichment increased the NO (nitric oxide) emissions at all concentrations. Injection of water along with intake air reduced the NO emissions considerably. Shorter ignition delay and combustion duration were observed with oxygen enrichment as compared to ambient oxygen operation. Water injection increased the ignition delay at all power outputs. The peak pressure and heat release rate were improved with oxygen enrichment as compared to neat MO operation. It was concluded that MO could be effective used as fuel in compression ignition engines by combusting it under oxygen enriched condition. The optimal oxygen concentration of 23.8% could be recommended for the highest BTE. However, the penalty in oxygen enrichment is the NO emission. Injection of water at the intake manifold could solve the problem of higher NO emissions. The optimal amount of water that could be injected without affecting the engines power and BTE could be recommended as 2% by volume. © 2018 SAE International. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={Without an iota of doubt, security, safety, and privacy are the most critical aspects of any Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environment. Among the existing intrusion detection methods, knowledge-based methods discover only the recognized attacks, the behavior-based methods suffer from high false positives, and specification-based methods demand the complete knowledge about the elements present in the IIoT environment. Examining the heterogeneous data from different and distributed sensors and sending the correct commands to actuators are vital to the increasingly industrialized economy. This work proposes an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for the IIoT environment that combines both the anomaly and specification-based approaches. The resulting system overcomes the limitations of the contemporary techniques by detecting unidentified attacks. All kinds of data emanating from any IIoT setup comprising sensors and actuators are logged, and specification rules are constructed from it. Any violations of the created rules are treated as attacks. The validation is carried out through simulation using the Mininet tool with the dataset obtained from the real-world water treatment facility at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD). The results show only 3.2% of false positives with the detection rate of 96.4%. © 2018 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.},

In this paper, a hybrid compression model is constructed to accomplish the benefits of both PCA and SPIHT. In the bio-medical research, compression becomes necessary due to transfer of patients images from one group of experts to other experts group. So that, the proposed image compression technique is useful for conserving the storage space needed for healthcare systems. Finally, it is concluded that the proposed PCA-SPIHT performs better than other recent state-of-the-art techniques with acceptable loss of image quality. © 2018, Scientific Publishers of India.

First we go through the original method used by Kuramoto to solve this system of coupled oscillators. Then we use a later approach developed by Ott and Antonsen. We will use this approach first to solve the original system and show that the results match. Next we will solve a variations of the this system using Ott-Antonsen method, after which we will use it to solve our particular system. We consider a variation of the Kuramoto system which shows multiple regions of synchronization. First we observe the effects of attractive and repulsive couplings. Next we qualitatively study the effect of the initial frequency distribution of the internal oscillators, both the mean and the standard deviation of different distributions like the Gaussian and Lorentzian distributions, on these synchronization regions. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.},

abstract={In this paper, we have investigated the development of the robust recognition system to identify the language of the spoken utterance in several classical Indian languages. The ability of the machines to identify the language in which communication takes place globally is a paramount in the current scenario. In this work on VQ clustering based language identification, feature vectors extracted from training speeches are converted into set of language specific clustering models. During testing, features extracted from test speeches are applied to the language specific clustering models and hypothesized language is identified based on minimum of averages corresponding to the model using minimum distance classifier. Clustering technique is evaluated with variations in cluster size and length of the test utterances. Better performance is observed for the cluster size of 64 and 900 test utterances of 2–3 s duration. Noteworthy point to be mentioned is that though the clustering technique is an old technique, it provides 97% as average recognition accuracy, 3.13% as average false acceptance rate and 3.13% as false rejection rate for the testing done on the language specific clustering model with 64 as cluster size. To improve the accuracy, formants are also used as a feature and it is observed that formant frequencies do provide complementary evidence in ensuring better accuracy for some of the languages. Performance of the system is assessed by calculating the identification rate as the one corresponding to the correct identification with respect to either MFPLPC or Formants and the overall average accuracy obtained is 99.4% for clustering model with 32 as cluster size. Experiments are conducted on the database containing speech utterances in seven classical and phonetically rich speaker specific Indian languages such as Bengali, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Tamil and Telugu. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.},

abstract={Recent developments in internet technologies have created a massive demand for online services with the rapidly growing users. Travel recommender systems have been embraced by many researchers due to recent developments and significant requirements in the e-tourism domain. Generating personalised recommendations with minimal interactions is a key challenge and predicting personalised list of locations with the available ratings alone cannot achieve effective recommendations. To address this issue, we develop an intelligent real-time user-specific travel recommender system (IRTUSTRS) through incorporating users' social network profile and current location by exploiting global positioning system (GPS) data for travel recommendation generation. The proposed IRTUSTRS approach helps end users through enhanced travel recommendations with improved accuracy. The experimental evaluation portrays the improved performance of IRTUSTRS over baseline approaches. The presented work helps to understand the performance of recommender systems by utilising online social network profile of users with the current location through the GPS data. © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

The commentary can be made interesting by narrating relevant stories related to live scenario of the sports game. But the knowledge of commentators, however wide for humans, is relatively less compared to that of the story details available about individual players. Here a system is presented called iSCoReS for individuals that can automatically suggest stories for commentators to tell during the live game. The iSCoReS for individuals is equipped with some scored examples of story-game state pairs which learns offline to connect sports stories of individual players to game states. Features describing the viewer would be input into the system, and stories could be selected partly based on these features. The problem addressed is to find and match the interesting stories as live commentary to a sports game for the individuals. Copyright © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

There exist some relationship in the first step, the size of the secret image and size of the shares which are derived from them. In the proposed method, these two steps are done concurrently. A cover image is chosen and according to its embedding capacity, share is generated and subsequently embedded into chosen cover to produce the stego image. This process is repeated till all the image portions are embedded. While generating share, meta-data (i.e.) header is created for each shares and appended to shares before being embedded. At the destination end, shares are extracted from each stego images and are reassembled into a single original secret image according to the meta-data present in each share.

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to propose a new mixed repetitive group sampling (RGS) plan based on the process capability index, Cpk, where the quality characteristics of interest follow the normal distribution with unknown mean and unknown variance. Tables are constructed to determine the optimal parameters for practical applications for both symmetric and asymmetric fraction non-conforming cases. The advantages of this proposed mixed sampling plan are also discussed. The proposed sampling plan is also compared with other existing sampling plans. Design/methodology/approach: In order to determine the optimal parameters of the proposed mixed RGS plan based on Cpk, the authors constructed tables for various combinations of acceptable and limiting quality levels (LQLs). For constructing tables, the authors followed the approach of two points on the operating characteristic (OC) curve. The optimal problem is formulated as a non-linear programming where the objective function to be minimized is the average sample number (ASN) and the constraints are related to lot acceptance probabilities at acceptable quality level and LQL under the OC curve. Findings: The proposed mixed RGS plan will be a new addition to the literature of acceptance sampling. It is shown that the proposed mixed plan involves minimum ASN with desired protection to both producers and consumers compared to other existing sampling plans. The practical application of the proposed mixed sampling plan is also explained with an illustrative real-time example. Originality/value: In this paper, the authors propose a new mixed RGS plan based on the process capability index Cpk, where the quality characteristic of interest follows the normal distribution with unknown mean and unknown variance. Tables are constructed to determine the optimal parameters for practical applications. The proposed mixed sampling plan can be used in all production industries. This kind of mixed RGS plan is not available in the literature. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={When large concentrated loads are acting over limited area of concrete, the bearing strength of concrete is known to be increasing due to the confining pressure of the enveloping concrete in the surroundings of the contact area. At the same time, the high contact pressure may be many fold of the compressive strength of the concrete. There are lots of examples in engineering applications of better utilization of bearing capacity such as steel base plates of steel columns and trusses over pedestals, anchorages in post-tensioned pre-stressed concrete beams, beams at bearings and supports, pile head and capping slab, concrete hinges, rockers, supports for huge street light structures etc. Present study concentrates mainly on the effect of the geometry of the pedestal on the bearing strength of Reinforced cement concrete pedestal under concentric and uniaxial loading conditions. Also, the effect of deformation and crack patterns are investigated. RC pedestals of different cross-section are considered in the study. © IAEME Publication.},

abstract={Physiological signals such as EEG, ECG and PPG are very sensitive in nature and they are invariably corrupted by Power line and environmental noises. Quite often the frequencies of the signal and the noise overlap. Because of the importance of the underlying signal it is imperative to eliminate the noise without altering the time domain representation of the signals. Hence normal frequency selective filtering alone is not suffice for processing these signals. A wavelet based filtering approach is ideal for this problem as wavelet transforms preserve both time resolution and frequency resolution of the input signal. In this manuscript a Multi-scale wavelet based noise removal algorithm is proposed for processing EEG, ECG and PPG signals. And it is shown that the algorithm not only removes the noise effectively but also keeps the time resolution of the input signal intact. The improvement in noise removal is verified by comparing the signal to noise ratio of signal before and after applying wavelet based filtering algorithm. © 2018, Pharmainfo Publications.

abstract={This paper presents the development of the robust speech recognition system for the children with hearing impairment. It is a challenging task to recognise the distorted speeches of the hearing impaired since the characteristics of the speeches uttered by these people normally have variations in terms of accent, pronunciation and speed. Because of their inability to hear, they are not able to speak even though their nasal and oral cavities aiding for the speech production are perfect like normal persons. This work mainly emphasises the use of MFCC & MF-PLP features at the front end and HMM & K-means clustering at the back end. Performance of the system is evaluated and compared for the two modelling techniques and recognition accuracy is 94%, 97% and 84% for MFCC with HMM and accuracy is 98.3%, 93.5% and 93.6% for MF-PLP with K-means clustering for recognition system developed for recognising isolated digits, connected words and continuous speeches of hearing impaired. Noteworthy point to be mentioned is that, though the clustering technique is an old technique, it is proved that it gives better results as compared to HMM.

abstract={Image de-noising is a process of eliminating the unwanted information occupied on the image during image acquisition and image digitization. The noise removal in an image is a challenging preprocess, concern to preserve minute details in the images. The selection of proper noise removal filter will make the sense of retaining the fine details in the image will helpful for feature extraction. Especially in the domain of sperm cell image processing, the better denoising technique is obligatory to maintain the fine details in the image. Generally these images are not clear due to different staining procedures followed during image acquisition. The various emerging noise removal filters are developed for microscopic medical images but they should be identified specifically with respect to the noise in the input image. Most of the microscopic medical images are degraded by Gaussian noise. So that the Gaussian noise is added artificially on the human spermatozoa cell image and de-noised by using several spatial filters. In this paper the performance of various de-noising filters is measured using objective fidelity criteria such as Mean Square Error (MSE), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Entropy. This performance analysis moves forward to have further research in denoising for microscopic sperm cell images. © 2005-ongoing JATIT & LLS.},

abstract={Cerium doped zinc oxide (CeZnO) (0.001–0.004 M) was deposited on the glass substrate using the spray pyrolysis method. We studied the changes in micro-structural, morphological, optical and gas sensing properties of the thin films at different molarity concentrations. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns confirms the hexagonal structure and polycrystalline nature. Crystallite size decreases with increase in Ce concentration. The surface morphology completely modified spherical to hexagonal after adding cerium was observed by using a field-emission scanning electron (FE-SEM). Transmittance and band gap increases with increases in dopant(Ce) concentrations. The 0.003 M CeZnO thin films shows a good response towards room temperature NH3, the response values is found to be 265.12–2040.81 respectively for 5 ppm–25 ppm. Quick response and recovery time is found to be 18 and 12 s at 25 ppm. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

Molecular electrostatic potential analysis shows the existence of σ-hole on the odd numbered clusters, which helps in their highly directional growth. QTAIM analysis show the existence of two intermolecular hydrogen bonds, of type S[sbnd]O ⋯ H[sbnd]C hydrogen bonds and methyl C[sbnd]H ⋯ H[sbnd]C dihydrogen bonds. The computed ρ and Laplacian values were all positive for the intermolecular bonds, supporting the existence of noncovalent interactions. The computed ellipticity for the dihydrogen bonds have values > 2, which confirms the delocalization of electron, are mainly due to the hydrogen-hydrogen interactions of methyl groups. A plot of total hydrogen bonding energy vs the observed total local electron density shows linearity with correlation coefficient of near unity, which indicates the cooperative effects of intermolecular dihydrogen H·H bonds. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Epigenetic and genomic alterations regulate the transcriptional landscape of cells during cancer onset and progression. Recent clinical studies targeting the epigenetic ‘readers’ (bromodomains) for cancer therapy have established the effectiveness of bromodomain (BRD) and extraterminal (BET) inhibitors in treating several types of cancer. In this review, we discuss key mechanisms of BET inhibition and synergistic combinations of BET inhibitors with histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), histone methyltransferase inhibitors (HMTi), DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi), kinase, B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and proteosome inhibitors, and immunomodulatory drugs for cancer therapy. We also highlight the potential of such combinations to overcome drug resistance, and the evolving approaches to developing novel BET inhibitors. Inhibition of BET Bromodomains has evolved as a promising strategy in cancer therapy. Synergistic combinations involving BET inhibitors and other drugs have proven successful in the clinic and may define new dimensions in epigenetic therapy. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) demand driving safety as an eminent design requirement for future generation vehicles. Collision evasion as well as consequent casualties minimization command timely delivery of significant precautionary information to the drivers. Consequently, the driver may get a clear view about the present driving situation and be able to adopt timely decision to circumvent the forthcoming dangers. This research work proposes an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) based situation assessment method that supports the drivers to take up suitable decisions by analyzing the driver behavior of preceding/succeeding cars. The proposed approach models the stability of drivers in the perspective of connected cars and deduce the current stability situations from the sensors which are implanted in the cars. This connected cars scenario for Collision Warning System (CWS) is simulated using three Raspberry Pi boards along with ultrasonic sensor, gas sensor and accelerometer sensor. These sensor data are transmitted to other preceding or succeeding cars using visible light communication. Subsequently, these data are processed using both Mamdani and ANFIS model for situation assessment which provides the stability level of drivers. The result concludes though the Mamdani model quickly computes the stability of driver by analyzing the sensor data, it suffers from low sensitivity and precision when compared to ANFIS which showcases higher sensitivity and precision. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.},

abstract={In general, the technologically important ferrites nanoparticles, magnetite and maghemite, are converted from cubic to the more stable rhombohedral structure above 500°C-700°C under air/vacuum/inert atmosphere. Here, we report, the superior thermal stability of polymer capped Fe3O4 (PCIO) nanocluster (synthesized using microwave-assisted polyol approach) up to 1000°C under vacuum and inert atmosphere. Raman spectra of post annealed PCIO nanoclusters show the Fe3O4 phase with carbon signature due to the decomposition of polymer matrix. The carbon layer seems to act as a thermal shield and increases the activation energy thereby preventing the intrusion of heat, oxygen, volatiles mass into the magnetic core. The presence of carbon layer was further confirmed from the high-resolution transmission electron microscopic image. After thermal annealing at 1000°C, PCIO nanoclusters showed superparamagnetic behavior with a saturation magnetization of 89 emu/g, close to the bulk saturation magnetization of Fe3O4 phase. In contrast, the uncoated Fe3O4 (UCIO) nanoclusters decompose at 700°C into α-Fe2O3 and FeO phases under similar annealing conditions. Our findings open up new possibilities of stabilizing nanomaterials for high-temperature applications. © 2017 The American Ceramic Society},

abstract={Blade vibration and blade clearance are effective diagnostic features for the identification of blade damage in rotating machines. Blade tip-timing (BTT) is a noncontact method that is often used to monitor the vibration and clearance of blades in a rotating machinery. Standard signal processing of BTT measurements give one blade response sample per revolution of the machine which is often insufficient for the diagnosis of damage. This paper uses the raw data signals from the sensors directly and employs a wavelet energy-based mistuning index (WEBMI) to predict the presence and locations of damage in rotating blades. The Lipschitz exponent is derived from the wavelet packet coefficients and used to estimate the severity of the damage. In this study, experiments were conducted to obtain BTT measurements on rotating blades at 100 rpm using three different sensors: an active eddy current sensor, a passive eddy current sensor, and an optical sensor. In addition, hammer excitation experiments were conducted for various added mass (damage) cases to compute the damage severity for a bladed disk. To simulate the damage experimentally in the bladed disk and rotating blades, masses were added to the blades to alter their dynamics and mimic the damage. The results indicate that the WEBMI can detect the presence and location of damage in rotating blades using measurements from common BTT sensors. To check the robustness of the proposed damage severity index, the experimental results were compared with numerical simulation for the bladed disk and showed good agreement. Copyright © 2018 P.

abstract={Several researchers have considered non-contact methods to monitor blade vibration such as the blade tip timing method. This method uses contactless sensors mounted on the casing around the engine. Eddy current sensors are investigated in this work due to their efficacy for monitoring blade vibration in harsh environments compared to other type of sensors. Very little experience in the modelling of eddy current sensors is available in the literature; therefore, a detailed 3D finite element model to simulate a rotating bladed disk passing an eddy current sensor was performed. In addition, a laboratory scale test rig was designed and manufactured in order to validate the proposed model with experimental measurements. Numerical and experimental results are presented in this paper. The integrated measured output of the sensor was investigated to show the effect of the blade deformation and clearance on the accuracy of the Blade Tip Timing measurements.

abstract={An experimental investigation of the fatigue response of commonly used structural stainless steel - SS 304 L(N) and SS 316 L(N) - and its weld was carried out through automated cyclic ball indentation (ABI). A Tungsten Carbide (WC) spherical ball indenter of 1.57 mm diameter was used for compression-compression fatigue testing of the specimen under load control at a low frequency of loading (typically 0.1 Hz to 1 Hz). The force-displacement response during fatigue loading was logged continuously during fatigue test and the data was analyzed to extract details such as variations in: total depth of penetration, loading and unloading slopes, loading/unloading intercept, displacement range as a function of number of cycles. From the results, one could identify an unsteady response of material during cyclic loading after some cycles of fatigue loading - typical of failure; this input was used to compare the fatigue response of different zones of the weld. Even though the applied frequency of loading is relatively less (~ 1 Hz), due to the high levels of plastic deformation that is developed during the indentation process, one could expect an effect of strain rate on the fatigue response during cyclic ball indentation. To verify this, experiments were carried out at three distinct frequencies of 0.1 Hz, 0.5 Hz and 1 Hz for a given loading condition. Further, it was observed that the material response in weld region is the best, followed by the base metal. This can be corroborated with the weld microstructure that is obtained as a consequence of processing. Frequency of loading did not have significant influence on the fatigue failure life. Numerical simulation of cyclic ball indentation was carried out to extract some relevant parameters for failure life such as mean stress and local stress ratio. This will serve as input to correlation of failure life data obtained from conventional specimens. Copyright © 2018 ASME},

abstract={Background: Stargardt disease is the most common cause of juvenile macular degeneration leading to early central visual loss. Dispensing of correct low-vision devices based on the residual visual function and specific visual requirements of a patient can result in a positive outcome. It is important to know the factors involved in the selection of these devices. This study was undertaken to assess these factors. Methods: Patients with Stargardt disease referred to a low-vision clinic underwent evaluation of visual status, disease stage, visual requirements and lifestyle. They were evaluated for suitability for successful use of various low-vision devices. Their education level and occupation were noted. They were counselled regarding the proper use of the devices and lifestyle modifications. For patients with extensive use of computers, modifications related to contrast, font size and audio software were explained. Results: Among the 97 patients in the study (age range 7–66 years, mean 23.7 ± 13.1), there were 49 (50.5 per cent) students, 36 (37.1 per cent) employed, eight (8.2 per cent) unemployed, and four (4.2 per cent) homemakers. Except for seven patients (7.2 per cent), all were literate, with education ranging from primary school to college graduation. The presenting visual acuity for distance was 0.10–1.47 (0.79 ± 0.28), and for near was N4–N40 (N9.95 ± 6.65). This acuity showed positive correlation with age (p &lt; 0.0001, R 2 = 0.16) and with magnification required (p &lt; 0.0001, R 2 = 0.26). Patients above 40 years preferred higher adds and half-eye glasses, whereas younger patients preferred dome magnifiers. The occupation also influenced the choice. Disease stage was seen to affect the choice with advanced stages requiring higher magnifiers (p = 0.03, R 2 = 0.11). Duration of disease and the magnification of low-vision devices showed a positive correlation (p = 0.03, R 2 = 0.049). Conclusions: Age, presenting visual acuity, disease stage, duration, education and occupation influenced the choice of low-vision devices in patients with Stargardt disease. However, they appear to be interdependent and a larger, controlled study is required to provide information on the individual effect. © 2018 Optometry Australia},

abstract={As a powerful extension to fuzzy set, hesitant fuzzy set (HFS) attracted many scholars in the recent times. The HFS had the ability to accept multiple membership values for a specific instance, which helped in handling uncertainty to a certain extent. However, the previous studies on the hesitant fuzzy theory consider only single occurring probability value for each element which is problematic for decision-makers (DMs) to associate an accurate occurring probability with each element. To alleviate this issue, in this paper, a new concept called interval-valued probabilistic hesitant fuzzy set (IVPHFS) is proposed. Some desirable properties of IVPHFS are also investigated. Further, a new aggregation operator called simple interval-valued probabilistic hesitant fuzzy weighted geometry (SIVPHFWG) is presented and some interesting properties are discussed. Following this, a new extension of statistical variance (SV) is put forward under IVPHFS for calculating the weights of each criterion. A new extension to the popular VIKOR (VlseKriterijumskaOptimizacijaKompromisnoResenje) method is also presented under IVPHFS for ranking objects. The practicality of the proposed decision framework is analyzed by presenting two illustrative examples, viz., supplier selection problem and smartphone selection problem. Finally, the strength and weakness of the proposed decision framework are realized by comparison with other methods. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={South Asia is home to ∼20% of the world population and characterized by distinct ethnic, linguistic, cultural and genetic lineages. Only limited representative samples from the region have found its place in large population-scale international genome projects. The recent availability of genome scale data from multiple populations and datasets from South Asian countries in public domain motivated us to integrate the data into a comprehensive resource. In the present study, we have integrated a total of six datasets encompassing 1213 human exomes and genomes to create a compendium of 154 814 557 genetic variants and adding a total of 69 059 255 novel variants. The variants were systematically annotated using public resources and along with the allele frequencies are available as a browsable-online resource South Asian genomes and exomes. As a proof of principle application of the data and resource for genetic epidemiology, we have analyzed the pathogenic genetic variants causing retinitis pigmentosa. Our analysis reveals the genetic landscape of the disease and suggests subset of genetic variants to be highly prevalent in South Asia. © The Author(s) 2018. Published by Oxford University Press.},

abstract={In developing countries, wounds are a major health concern and pose a significant problem. Hence, the development of new materials that can act as scaffolds for in situ tissue regeneration and regrowth is necessary. In this report, we present a new class of injectable oleogel and composite gel derived from glycolipids that provide reversible interlinked 3D fiberous network architecture for effective wound closure by tissue regrowth and regeneration. Glycolipids were derived from α-chloralose and various vinyl esters using Novozyme 435, an immobilized lipase B from Candida antarctica as a catalyst, in good yield. These glycolipids undergo spontaneous self-assembly in paraffin oil to form an oleogel, in which curcumin was successfully incorporated to generate a composite gel. Morphological analysis of the oleogel and composite gel clearly revealed the formation of a 3D fiberous network. Rheological investigation revealed the thermal and mechanical processability of the oleogel and composite gel under various experimental conditions. Interestingly, the developed injectable oleogel and composite gel are able to accelerate the wound healing process by regulating the overlapping phases of inflammation, cell proliferation and extracellular matrix remodelling. Since chloralose displays anesthetic properties, this study will establish a new strategy to develop anesthetic wound healing oleogels in the future. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={A vertex coloring of a graph G is a mapping that allots colors to the vertices of G. Such a coloring is said to be a proper vertex coloring if two vertices joined by an edge receive different colors. The chromatic number χ(G) is the least number of colors used in a proper vertex coloring. In this paper, we compute the χ of certain distance graphs whose distance set elements are (a) a finite set of Catalan numbers, (b) a finite set of generalized Catalan numbers, (c) a finite set of Hankel transform of a transformed sequence of Catalan numbers. Then while discussing the importance of minimizing interference in wireless networks, we probe how a vertex coloring problem is related to minimizing vertex collisions and signal clashes of the associated interference graph. Then when investigating the χ of certain G(V, D) and graphs with interference, we also compute certain lower and upper bound for χof any given simple graph in terms of the average degree and Laplacian operator. Besides obtaining some interesting results we also raised some open problems. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={In this paper, adaptive neural networks (NNs) are employed in the event-triggered feedback control framework to enable a robot manipulator to track a predefined trajectory. In the proposed output feedback control scheme, the joint velocities of the robot manipulator are reconstructed using a nonlinear NN observer by using the joint position measurements. Two different configurations are proposed for the implementation of the controller depending on whether the observer is co-located with the sensor or the controller in the feedback control loop. Besides the observer NN, a second NN is utilized to compensate the effects of nonlinearities in the robot dynamics via the feedback control. For both the configurations, by utilizing observer NN and the second NN, torque input is computed by the controller. The Lyapunov stability method is employed to determine the event-triggering condition, weight update rules for the controller, and the observer for both the configurations. The tracking performance of the robot manipulator with the two configurations is analyzed, wherein it is demonstrated that all the signals in the closed-loop system composed of the robotic system, the observer, the event-sampling mechanism, and the controller are locally uniformly ultimately bounded in the presence of bounded disturbance torque. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed design, simulation results are presented. IEEE},

abstract={The computation of fast Fourier transform (FFT) plays a vital role in all fields of science and engineering, especially in the medical domain. Spectral results of the data convey more information to the clinicians to take handy decisions during the diagnosis. If a problem happens during the computation of FFT, the incorrect results misinterpret the information and hence the suggestions and decisions by practitioners would be the useless one moreover, it may yield harmful result to the patients. This paper deals with how to recover the spectrum from the faulty one with the heart sound case reports. The heart sound recording is the phonocardiogram (PCG) signal. Stethoscopes are commonly used to hear the heart sound for diagnosis. The two PCG signals of normal and abnormal subjects in each were analyzed in this paper. The normal subject produce clear lub and dub sounds, where the abnormal subject produce a kind of whistling or swishing sound in middle which may be due to the problem of septal defect in a heart. This paper analyzes four PCG signals spectrally with fault and the recovered ones along with the execution time results in each using Matlab R2016b tool. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Along with tRNAs, enzymes that modify anticodon bases are a key aspect of translation across the tree of life. tRNA modifications extend wobble pairing, allowing specific ("target") tRNAs to recognize multiple codons and cover for other ("nontarget") tRNAs, often improving translation efficiency and accuracy. However, the detailed evolutionary history and impact of tRNA modifying enzymes has not been analyzed. Using ancestral reconstruction of five tRNA modifications across 1093 bacteria, we show that most modifications were ancestral to eubacteria, but were repeatedly lost in many lineages. Most modification losses coincided with evolutionary shifts in nontarget tRNAs, often driven by increased bias in genomic GC and associated codon use, or by genome reduction. In turn, the loss of tRNA modifications stabilized otherwise highly dynamic tRNA gene repertoires. Our work thus traces the complex history of bacterial tRNA modifications, providing the first clear evidence for their role in the evolution of bacterial translation. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={Aluminium alloys are of much use in several vital areas including aerospace, marine, defence and railways, which becomes obligatory to have a welded joint of high strength. The input considerations of the friction stir welding process of double-sided type play an imperative part in identifying the performance and characteristics of the joints. This research is a novel approach to investigate the influence of weld input parameters on the output responses of aluminium 6082-T6 alloy using tapered square and tapered pentagonal tool pin profiles. The double-sided friction stir welding (FSW) was chosen for the research work, as it gives better strength joint than single-sided ones. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to establish the interactions through mathematical relationships, considering the FSW process parameters and output responses. The influence of tapered square (TSP) and tapered pentagonal pin (TPP) profiles on the welding characteristics was analysed. Also, an extended investigation was carried out in achieving the welding parameters in optimum level, so as to maximize the output responses. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.},

abstract={The continuous developments of the computer technologies in the intelligent transportation systems (ITS) place an important role in the various applications such as vehicle detection, traffic control detection and so on. Hence, in this paper we use the robust principal fuzzy subtraction method and gradient partial equation method (RPFGPE) for investigating the multi-modal background detection-subtraction with illumination changes and cast shadow removal method to effectively recognise the vehicle from the video footage. These methods analyse each and every pixel present in the video frame images while analysing the background as well as cast shadow. The effectiveness of the proposed system is evaluated with the help of the experimental results which is compared with the other methods for background subtraction, cast shadow removal with different illumination changes.

abstract={The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 300 million people have asthma and that this disease causes about 250 thousand deaths per year worldwide. The number of deaths from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease increased by 30% in 2015, and this disease will, according to WHO, be the third major cause of death worldwide in 2030. The identification of diseases using medical image processing techniques is in high demand to assist medical doctors to make more accurate diagnoses. However, although these techniques contribute in making medical diagnoses, most of them still need to have some parameters set and this can be a difficult and tedious process. In this paper, a new automatic approach to identify and classify lung diseases from a structural co-occurrence matrix (SCM) in chest computed tomography images is proposed. The most important novelty of this approach is that only the image is used as the input data and extract the structural information of the disease which, in this case, is related to the lower frequencies. In order to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed technique, it was compared with other well-known state-of-art feature extractors. In addition, the SCM was evaluated with four filters (Gaussian, Fourier, Laplace and Sobel) using linear discriminant analysis, multi-layer perceptron, support vector machines and minimal learning machine classifiers. The results showed that the SCM, when using low frequencies, is able to adapt to different images and extract the most significant structural data, without the need of any additional parameters, yet maintaining the diagnostic precision. © 2018, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.},

abstract={Electrochemical ultracapacitors exhibiting high energy output and an ultra-long cycle life, utilizing green and sustainable materials, are of paramount importance for next-generation applications. Developing an ultracapacitor that has high output energy under high power conditions in a high-voltage non-aqueous electrolyte and maintaining a long cycle life is an ongoing challenge. Herein, we utilize watermelon seeds, a bio-waste from watermelons, for use in high-voltage, high-energy, and high-power ultracapacitors in a sodium ion-based non-aqueous electrolyte. The as-synthesized hierarchically porous, high surface area carbon is surface-engineered with a large quantity of nitrogen and sulfur heteroatoms to give a high specific capacitance of ∼252 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 and 90 F g-1 at 30 A g-1. An ultra-high stability of ∼90% even after 150000 cycles (10 A g-1) with 100% coulombic efficiency is achieved at room temperature (25 °C), equivalent to an ultra-low energy loss of ∼0.0667% per 1000 cycles. Furthermore, the porous carbon demonstrates remarkable stability even at high temperature (55 °C) for 100000 cycles (10 A g-1), ensuring the safety of the device and enabling it to outperform graphene-based materials. A maximum energy of ∼79 W h kg-1 and a maximum power of 22.5 kW kg-1 with an energy retention of ∼28.2 W h kg-1 was attained. The results provide new insights that will be of use in the development of high-performance, green ultracapacitors for advanced energy storage systems. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={The microstructure of nodular cast irons is characterized by the presence of spheroidal graphite nodules. Metallographic tests may show irregular or degenerated graphite nodules that indicate a reduction in tensile strength of the material as well as its yield limit. This work proposes a computer vision algorithm to estimate the amount of degenerated graphite nodules as well as image analysis necessary to determine the relationship between this quantity of degenerated nodules and the loss of mechanical properties of the nodular cast iron. The proposed algorithm was tested using two cast iron samples, by measuring their microhardness and tensile strength. The results show that the amount of degenerated graphite nodules is inversely proportional to the limit of traction resistance. Sample “A”, of the two samples tested, presented more degenerated nodules than “B” and a lower limit of traction resistance; therefore, it needs less strength to break. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Timely reperfusion is considered an optimal treatment for AMI. Paradoxically, the procedure of reperfusion can itself cause myocardial tissue injury. Therefore, a strategy to minimize the reperfusion-induced myocardial tissue injury is vital for salvaging the healthy myocardium. Herein, we investigated the cardioprotective effects of fisetin, a natural flavonoid, against ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury (IRI) using a Langendorff isolated heart perfusion system. I/R produced significant myocardial tissue injury, which was characterized by elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase in the perfusate and decreased indices of hemodynamic parameters. Furthermore, I/R resulted in elevated oxidative stress, uncoupling of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, increased mitochondrial swelling, a decrease of the mitochondrial membrane potential, and induction of apoptosis. Moreover, IRI was associated with a loss of the mitochondrial structure and decreased mitochondrial biogenesis. However, when the animals were pretreated with fisetin, it significantly attenuated the I/R-induced myocardial tissue injury, blunted the oxidative stress, and restored the structure and function of mitochondria. Mechanistically, the fisetin effects were found to be mediated via inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), which was confirmed by a biochemical assay and molecular docking studies.

abstract={Herbal medicine is one of the oldest valuable bestowal that was given to mankind. Many plants and herbs hold their prestigious position in the field of medicine among which Ficus religiosa belonging to the family Moraceae is the vital one. It is commonly named as “sacred fig”, “Bo tree” “Peepal” or “Ashwattha” in Sanskrit. It is found all over India, as it is one of the sacred tree worshipped by Hindus. The different parts of the F. religiosa species tree namely bark, fruits, leaves, seeds and latex are used as chief indigenous medicines to cure various ailments. Recent studies have reported that F. religiosa is used in the traditional medicine to relieve about 50 types of disorders including diabetes, diarrhea, epilepsy inflammatory disorders, and gastric problems, sexual and infectious disorders. Green synthesis of Nano Particles (NPs) plays significant roles in medicines, clinical applications and in vitro diagnostic applications. This has also attracted the use of F. religiosa in the process of green synthesis of NPs where specific targeted treatment and theranostics are made easier. The applications of the green nanotechnology using F. religiosa has shown that the phytochemical investigation of plant extracts exhibits the presence of flavonoids, tannins, phenoids, alkaloids, saponins and terpenoids. The studies also prove that the extracts express pharmacological activities like anti-oxidant, anti-bacterial, hypoglycemic, hypo-lipidemic, wound-healing, anti-helmintic, immune-modulatory, anti-convulsant and anti-ulcer in Humans. The present study is an attempt to compile and provide a brief review on the phytochemical investigations and pharmacological applications of F. religiosa. © 2016 EManuscript, C/o Phcog.Net.

The most prominently utilized system is continual. Static authentication has been slow to develop, whereas continual systems have rapidly evolved. To solidify effectiveness of authentication, we have introduced a new model which is robust. In this approach, user draws a gesture using mouse. These gestures are collected and evaluation through a cover markov model classifier, a remarkable consistency in mouse gesture systems, in regards to False Rejection Ratio and False Acceptance Ratio in comparison to conventional systems. From the results, one can observe that there is improvement in terms of precision and authentication in comparison with conventional systems.

TPA with N-methylbarbituric acid (BA-1) showed bright yellow fluorescence (λmax = 550 nm, Φf = 22.8%) whereas OCH3 substitution at the phenyl rings of TPA, (BA-2 and BA-3) produced strong red (λmax = 602 nm, Φf = 41.1%) and orange fluorescent solids (λmax = 582 nm, Φf = 19.1%). Indanedione acceptor dyes exhibited red to deep red fluorescence. ID-1 showed red fluorescence at 604 nm (Φf = 17.7%) whereas ID-2 and ID-3 showed fluorescence at 611 (Φf = 19.4%) and 636 nm (Φf = 14.1%) in the solid state. Solid state structural analysis revealed alteration of the molecular conformation and packing by OCH3 substitution which led to tunable fluorescence. BA and ID compounds showed turn-off fluorescence/substantially reduced fluorescence intensity upon hard crushing (Φf = 1.2 to 3.1%). Interestingly, heating of BA and ID crushed powders led to turn-on fluorescence/significant enhancement of fluorescence intensity (Φf = 5.6 to 22.5%). Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) studies indicated the conversion of the crystalline phase to amorphous and the amorphous phase to crystalline by hard crushing and heating. The reversible conversion of the crystalline phase to amorphous phase was responsible for the fluorescence switching of BA and ID. Computational studies have been performed to get an insight into the energy level modulation upon the change of the molecular conformation. Thus, we have presented the facile preparation of strong red fluorescent dyes exhibiting high contrast stimuli-responsive reversible dark and bright fluorescence switching in the solid state. © This journal is The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={Facial expressions are essential to recognize human emotions. This paper focuses on facial expression analysis based on hybrid approach using principal component analysis (PCA) and local binary patterns (LBP). In this paper, the data set contains six various face expressions that include a set of emotional expressions like anger, disgust, fear, happiness, neutral and surprise. It covers five elements like face detection; face part detection; localization of points; feature extraction and classification. The first step is executed by famous Viola-Jones algorithm. Active Shape Model technique is applied for locating feature point in certain area of the face. The feature extraction is performed using PCA and LBP technique. Finally the classification step is performed by multi-class support vector machine (SVM) classifier. PCA technique converts whole facial expression image into global gray scale features as well as reduces the data size. LBP technique is used to extract the texture of the specified region which is in the form of gray scale image. The recognition rate for PCA with multi-class SVM is found to be 67 % and accuracy is 42% whereas the recognition rate of 75% and accuracy of 75% are achieved after the inclusion of LBP. Hence, the proposed hybrid approach gives better recognition rate and accuracy in terms of recognizing facial emotions. © 2006-2018 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).},

abstract={The realization of any wireless sensor network (WSNs) clearly determined on how the key quality of service (QoS) attributes/non-functional requirements (NFRs) gets accomplished. The well-known issues to be taken into account while designing WSNs for setting up smarter environments are information precision (timeliness and accuracy), data accretion, network latency, and energy efficiency. A wisely employed clustering algorithm for interconnecting sensor nodes can significantly enhance the energy efficiency of WSNs. However, the aspect of clustering involves additional overheads due to cluster head selection and cluster construction. This research work proposes a workaround that utilizes Type-II fuzzy for fusing the data and tree driven clustering algorithm that employs Type-2 fuzzy logic to improve the QoS parameters as well as preserving the power/energy of sensor networks. The primary objectives of the proposed cluster algorithm are two folded. Firstly, it constructs the clusters and chooses the cluster head (CH) by considering the remaining energy in the nodes and its distance from the base station (BS). Secondly, it performs the data fusion which contains meaningful information that has been sensed and captured. An extensive experimental analysis has been done on the proposed FBDF-TBC method by comparing it against its counterparts. The simulation results conclude that the proposed fuzzy-based technique for data fusion and tree-based clustering routing algorithm (FBDF-TBC) outperforms other clustering algorithms and improves the overall network lifetime of WSN from a minimum of 16% to maximum of 76%. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.},

abstract={The variations in impact strength of steel Fibre Reinforced Concrete (FRC) were statistically, commanded in this research. For this purpose, the experimental impact test results of earlier researchers were investigated using two statistical approaches. Firstly, normality test was carried out on first crack strength (N1) and failure strength (N2) using distribution plot and its accuracy was verified with Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Shapiro-Wilk and Chen-Shapiro test. Secondly, strength reliability analysis was carried out using two parameter Weibull distribution and their Weibull parameters were determined using three methods viz., Empherical Method of Justus (EMJ), Method of Moments (MOM) and Empherical Method of Lysen (EML). Results suggested that, if three samples are used to determine the N1 value for researchers’ data, at 95% levels of confidence, then the error in the measured value is about 50%. The 0.1 reliability level of the impact strength values of EMJ, EML and MOM were 153, 120 and 153 respectively in case of N1 and were 198, 156, and 198 respectively in case of N2 based on earlier researcher’s data. © 2017, Korean Society of Civil Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Impact strength data is a noteworthy factor for designing airport pavements, civilian and military structures etc and it is ought to be modelled precisely. In order to achieve an appropriate modelling data, it is important to select a suitable estimation method. One such commonly used statistical tool is the two parameter Weibull distribution for modelling impact failure strength accurately besides the variations in test results. This study statistically commandsthe variations in the impact failure strength (number of blows to induce failure) of fibre reinforced concrete (FRC) subjected to drop hammer test. Subsequently, a four-different novel method for the computation of Weibull parameter (Shape parameter) based on the earlier researchers test results has been proposed. The accuracy of the proposed four novel method is demonstrated by comparing with power density method and verified with goodness of fit test. Finally, the impact failure strength of FRC is offered in terms of reliability.

abstract={Molecular photoswitching, light induced reversible color/fluorescence modulation, has mostly been realized in organic molecules via E/Z isomerization of azobenzenes and stilbenes and ring opening/closing reactions of spiropyrans and diarylethenes. We report here new fluorescent molecular photoswitches based on triphenylamine (TPA)-imidazole derivatives, N-phenyl-N-(4-(1,4,5-triphenyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl)phenyl)benzenamine (NTPB) and N-phenyl-N-(4-(1-phenyl-1H-phenanthro[9,10-d]imidazol-2-yl)phenyl)benzenamine (NPPB), that exhibited light induced reversible fluorescence switching via conformational change from a twisted molecular structure to more planar. NTPB and NPPB in CHCl3 showed red shift of absorption and fluorescence upon UV light irradiation whereas white light exposure reversed both absorption as well as fluorescence. The role of the TPA-imidazole twisted molecular structure in photoswitching was established based on structure property, computational and photophysical studies. The isobestic point observed in time dependent fluorescence change under UV light irradiation clearly demonstrated the presence of two different conformational isomers. Interestingly, polymorphism and torsion angle (τ) dependent fluorescence of NTPB and NPPB in the solid state also supported the role of the twisted molecular structure of TPA-imidazole in fluorescence switching/tuning. Interestingly, NTPB showed fluorescence photoswitching in the solid state also whereas rigid phenanthrene based NPPB did not show fluorescence photoswitching. Thus the present studies provide structural insight for designing a new type of fluorescent organic molecular photoswitches based on conformational modulation that could be of potential interest in optoelectronic devices. © the Owner Societies 2018.},

abstract={The development of the Internet of Things (IoT) is predicted to change the healthcare industry and might lead to the rise of the Internet of Medical Things. The IoT revolution is surpassing the present-day human services with promising mechanical, financial, and social prospects. This paper investigated the security of medical images in IoT by utilizing an innovative cryptographic model with optimization strategies. For the most part, the patient data are stored as a cloud server in the hospital due to which the security is vital. So another framework is required for the secure transmission and effective storage of medical images interleaved with patient information. For increasing the security level of encryption and decryption process, the optimal key will be chosen using hybrid swarm optimization, i.e., grasshopper optimization and particle swarm optimization in elliptic curve cryptography. In view of this method, the medical images are secured in IoT framework. From this execution, the results are compared and contrasted, whereas a diverse encryption algorithm with its optimization methods from the literature is identified with the most extreme peak signal-to-noise ratio values, i.e., 59.45 dB and structural similarity index as 1. © 2018, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.},

abstract={The energy obtained from the photovoltaic array is dependent on the available solar insolation, the panel tilt angle and the power point tracking algorithm of the system. Some of the Conventional MPPT methods are developed by considering uniform solar irradiance. During partial shading conditions, solar panel may produce multiple Local Maximum Power Points (LMPPs) in its power voltage characteristic curve. A new algorithm has been developed in this paper by using sequential sampling embedded with existing incremental conductance procedure in order to predict the Global Maximum Power Point (GMPP). The tracking capability of proposed algorithm is verified with simulation works carried out in MATLAB/SIMULINK. The results of proposed algorithm are likened with the results classical Perturb and Observe (P & O) and Incremental Conductance algorithms. © 2018 University of Banja Luka, Faculty of Electrical Engineering.},

abstract={In this investigation, the heat and mass transfer characteristics in boundary layer flow about a stretching sheet in a porous medium filled with TiO2–water and Al2O3–water-based nanofluids, in the presence of internal heat generation or absorption and viscous dissipation with variable suction or injection effects is numerically studied. The similarity transformations are used to transform the governing boundary layer equations for momentum, energy and species transfer into a set of non-linear ordinary differential equations which are solved numerically by Keller-box method. The obtained numerical results are validated against results computed by using MATLAB bvp4c routine, and excellent agreement is observed. The impact of various pertinent parameters on velocity, temperature and concentration as well as the friction factor coefficient, local heat and mass transfer rates are derived and discussed through graphs and tables for TiO2 and Al2O3 water-based nanofluids. The present study reveals that an increase in Eckert number (Ec) and heat generation/absorption parameter (Q) significantly decreases local heat transfer rate. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is a non-invasive method for investigating the structure and function of the brain. Using fMRI, brain functions and areas responsible for the particular activities are investigated. The objective of the image processing methods using fMRI is to investigate the functional connectivity. To localize mental functions of specific brain regions and to identify the brain regions, those are activated simultaneously. Correlation and cross-coherence of the time series of the pixels are used for the detection of functional connectivity in fMRI images for the different motor movements (upper and lower limb movement and finger tapping action). The methodology was applied to three groups (six subjects) consisting aged between 10 and 75 years: (1) Normal and healthy subject performing finger tapping actions, (2) brain tumour patient performing lower limb movement (LL), and (3) brain tumour patient performing upper limb movements (UL). The threshold applied for the cross-correlation is 5000. Similarly, the threshold applied for cross-coherence and power parameters is in the range of (0.6–0.9). The algorithm implemented is found to be non-destructive, and there is no loss of temporal or spatial data. The result shows that for the normal subject, functionally connected pixels are more as compared to the brain tumour patients. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Every day risk of cardiovascular diseases is increasing in young adults. Now researchers are working on study related to a single bio-signal for prediction of maximum physiological parameters. One of such a bio-signal is photoplethysmogram (PPG). Non-invasive measurement of blood volume change is carried out by using PPG. PPG captured from a cranial site is known as cranial photoplethysmogram (CPPG). Most of the time various bio-signals acquired from the brain are used to study only the brain-related disorders. Near-infrared spectroscopy-based sensor used to record CPPG from frontal region can be used to predict heart rate, oxygen saturation, blood pressure, cardiac output and respiration rate. This paper explains the design specifications of sensor used and study of various time and amplitude indices of differentiated CPPG signal. Authors have studied two levels of differentiation of CPPG obtained by applying MATLAB-based algorithm. Features obtained from differentiated CPPG signal are compared with the standard available values to check the feasibility of this brain signal in the prediction of vascular health. The study was carried out on 19 healthy subjects aged between 19 and 30 years. Our results showed that the optical brain signal used to study hemodynamic changes in brain can also be used for the prediction of vascular health. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Heart Rate Variability (HRV) has been a growing major health concern worldwide. It is a key factor to determine an individual’s cardiovascular condition. The imbalance in the heart rate has profound impact in causation of several heart diseases. This study aimed to investigate the HRV risk factors that are predominant in the development of heart diseases in motorbike riders. It involves 10 healthy subjects riding five different Indian make motorbikes. Photo plethysmography signal was recorded in three different conditions such as before, during and after motorbike riding using pulse oximeter. The acquired physiological signals from different motorbike riders were processed to determine the variability in the heart rate. The parameters such as systolic amplitude, diastolic amplitude and dicrotic notch for all considered motorbikes were extracted. The results of this study shows an exceptionally high risks of variation in the heart rate among motorbike riders for vehicles having overall kerb weight of 187 kg, moderate risks for kerb weight between 144-145 kg and low risks for motorbikes having kerb weight between 132-137 kg. Body vibration too had an impact on the heart rate variability. Our study thus, reveals that existence of abnormal HRV owing to increase in motorbike kerb weight and speed. The other factors such as vehicle suspension, body design and wheels dimension also indirectly influences HRV. We suggest that essential ergonomic interventions are required to eliminate HRV exposure risks in motorbikes. © 2018, Scientific Publishers of India. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Until recently, it has been relatively hard to prepare vertically aligned vanadium sesquioxide (V2O3) nanosheets on glass substrates due to their extreme sensitivity to the atmosphere, doping, external pressure, and temperature. In this study, we present a simple one-step sputtering technique for the preparation of high-density vertically aligned V2O3 nanosheets on glass substrates without the use of any catalyst or template. To date, this structure has not been achieved using the V2O3 phase through sputtering. The definite oxidation state and phase of V2O3 with V3O5 inclusions were confirmed from the binding energies of the V2p3/2 and O1s peaks via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The growth mechanism of nanosheets has been briefly explained. In this way, hierarchical V2O3 nanosheets interconnected with each other, which would allow easy electron transport between electrodes, favour remarkable sensing performance. The nanosheets exhibited trace-level ammonia (NH3) detection under ambient conditions for a wide concentration range of 10-500 ppm. Moreover, the selectivity and stability of the V2O3 nanosheets was studied. The present study may permit the design and fabrication of new electronic materials with multiple advantages based on V2O3 nanosheets. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={Diabetes is the major health problem in modern civilization which occurs due to inadequate metabolism of carbohydrate and lipid could cause tremendous changes in the metabolic activities of liver. In this study, we investigated the antihyperglycemic, antioxidant and antihyperlipidemic effects of hesperetin, a citrus flavonoid against streptozotocin (STZ)-induced experimental rats. To stimulate diabetes mellitus, rats were injected with STZ intraperitoneally at a single dose of 45 mg/kg. STZ induced rats showed marked increase in the level of plasma glucose and significant reduction in the level of plasma insulin. The activities of carbohydrate metabolic enzymes, hepatic glycogen, lipid profiles, enzymic antioxidants in circulatory system and pancreas, hepatic and renal functional markers were explored. Supplementation with hesperetin (40 mg/kg b.w) to STZ-induced experimental rats for 45 days established a significant decline in plasma glucose and a marked improvement in plasma insulin and glycogen levels in STZ-induced rats. The altered activities of hepatic glucose metabolic enzymes, lipid profiles, enzymic antioxidants and serum biomarkers of liver and kidney toxicity were restored to almost normal. The acquired outcome were compared with glibenclamide (1 mg/kg b.w), a standard oral hypoglycemic drug. Hesperetin treatment was found to be efficient in protecting the normal histological manifestation of hepatic, renal and insulin positive β-cells in STZ induced rats. On the basis of current experimental findings, we concluded that administration of hesperetin attenuates the hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia through ameliorating antioxidant competence in STZ-induced experimental rats. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS},

abstract={Neuromuscular disorder is a complex progressive health problem which results in muscle weakness and fatigue. In recent years, with emergence and development of machine learning- and sequencing-driven technologies, the prediction of neuromuscular disorders could be made on the basis of gene expression for accurate diagnosis of disease. The intent is to correctly distinguish the patients affected from neuromuscular disorder from the healthy one with the help of various classification methods used in machine learning. In this paper, we proposed a novel feature selection method which applies deep learning method for grouping the outputs generated through various classifiers. The feature selection is performed on the basis of integrated Bhattacharya coefficient and genetic algorithm (GA) where fitness is computed on the basis of ensemble outputs of various classifiers which is performed using deep learning methods. The Bhattacharya coefficient computed the most effective gene subset; then, the most discriminative gene subset will be formulated using GA. The proposed integrated deep learning multi-model ensemble method was applied on two commercially available neuromuscular disorder datasets. The obtained results encouraged that the proposed integrated approach enhances the prediction accuracy of neuromuscular disorders as compared with different datasets and other classifier algorithms. The proposed deep learning-driven ensemble method provides more accurate and effective results for neuromuscular disorder prediction and classification with the help of distinguished classifiers. © 2018, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={This paper presents the design of the Internet of Things (IoT)-based greenhouse traceability model for the tracking and recordkeeping of seedlings and other agricultural products in the germination and growth stages. Traced products are generally of high quality and high commercial value, making the voluntary adoption of traceability processes for the market in processed products and trade in fresh products more common today. The transmission of diseases to humans, along with the cases of chemical poisoning, provided the motive for changes in trade relations between the countries and in the manner of assessing consumer safety. The model allows the tracking of variables, such as luminosity, humidity, temperature, and water consumption, thereby revealing overall water use, growth patterns of the plants, and the timeline for harvest of produce. The system enables automated control of the indoor environment of the greenhouse using an irrigation system or temperature control and presents the main outline of internal traceability of agricultural products from seed to final produce. By means of an IoT platform, this greenhouse design finally facilitates a novel analysis of the behavior of a number of species that comprise the local agriculture in one region of Colombia. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Alcoholism is an adverse situation that changes the functioning of important part of nervous system which is neuron. This changes the functional behavior of alcoholic person. The diagnosis of this state is done with the help of EEG signals which gets modified with the electrical activity of the brain. The EEG data sets used in this paper are taken from the University of California at Irvine, Irvine, knowledge discovery and databases. A review on how the EEG signals get affected by the consumption of alcohol and the extraction of features from these signals help to differentiate alcoholic and uninfluenced people with the help of graphical user interface (GUI) is presented in this paper. GUI is an interface that showcases the features extracted from the raw EEG data and classifies the two different classes. This is achieved with the help of sample entropy, approximate entropy, mean, and standard deviation of raw EEG data collected from the electrodes frontal polar, frontal, and central. This GUI system is economical and efficient which is used as a proper clinical decision support system by clinicians and also helps rehabilitation centres in getting to know about the subject. Quadratic SVM gives a highest accuracy of 95% for the detection of alcoholic EEG signal. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={India is one of the largest producers of jute, its potential use in many branches of engineering should be developed for the prosperity of the nation. The recent trends in utilizing the natural fibers has increased due to its advantages over synthetic fibers due to low cost, low environment hazard and easy availability. The properties of the fiber is improved by treating the jute fiber with alkali and latex polymer. Since, very few studies been conducted using the treated jute fiber concrete, an experimental work was carried with 0.6% as optimum percentage of treated jute fibers based on the mechanical properties of concrete. The influence of flexural characteristics of concrete was compared with control beams and beams cast with fibers in whole area and also only in tension zone of beam for M20 and M25 concrete grade. The beams with fibers of whole area had better strength, stiffness characteristic than the control beam and the beam with fibers in tension zone only. The initial cracking load was increased by 12.92% and 11.23 % and ultimate load was increased by 6.94% and 7. 20% for the beams cast with fibers in whole area for M20 and M25 grade of concrete, respectively. © 2018 Authors.},

The pathological detection and identification of brain tumor and comparison among normal and abnormal tissues need grouped scientific techniques for features extraction, displaying, and measurement of the disease images. Our study shows an improved automated brain tumor segmentation and identification approach using ANN from MR images without human mediation by applying the best attributes toward preparatory brain tumor case revelation. To obtain the exact district region of brain tumor from MR images, we propose a brain tumor segmentation technique that has three noteworthy improvement focuses. To begin with, K-means clustering will be utilized as a part of the principal organization in the process of improving the MR image to be marked in the districts regions in light of their gray scale. Second, ANN is utilized to choose the correct object in view of training phase. Third, texture feature of brain tumor area will be extracted to the division stage. With respect to the brain tumor identification, the grayscale features are utilized to analyze and diagnose the brain tumor to differentiate the benign and malignant cases. According to the study results demonstrated that: (1) enhancement adaptive strategy was utilized as post-processing in brain tumor identification; (2) identify and build an assessment foundation of automated segmentation and identification for brain tumor cases; (3) highlight the methods based on region growing method and K-means clustering technique to select the best region; and (4) evaluate the proficiency of the foreseen outcomes by comparing ANN and SVM segmentation outcomes, and brain tumor cases classification.

abstract={Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a name for a group of neurodevelopmental conditions that are characterized by some degree of impairment in social interaction, verbal and non-verbal communication, and difficulty in symbolic capacity and repetitive behaviors. The only protocol followed currently for ASD diagnosis is the qualitative behavioral assessment by experts through internationally established descriptive scaling standards. The assessment can, therefore, be affected by the degree of the evaluator experience as well as by the level of the descriptive standard robustness. This paper presents an EEG-based quantitative approach intended for automatic discrimination between children with typical neurodevelopment and children with ASD. The suggested work relies on second-order difference plot (SODP) area as a discriminative feature: First, every EEG channel in a 64 electrode cap—for every volunteer—is decomposed into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) by empirical mode decomposition (EMD). Next, the second-order difference plot for the first ten intrinsic mode functions—of every channel—is sketched. Third, the value of the elliptical area —for every plot—is calculated. The 95% confidence ellipse area is used as the discriminative feature. Fourth, paired t-student test is applied to the vectors consisting of discriminative feature values for counterpart channels/IMFs (e.g., channel FPz/IMF7 in autistic and neurotypical) for all volunteers. Finally, principal component analysis (PCA) and neural network (NN) are applied to the SODP area feature matrix for two-class classification (ASD and neurotypical). Moreover, the 3D mapping of EEG SODP area values was implemented and analyzed. The obtained results show that the conducted t-student tests yield values of less than 0.05, and that the NN two-class classification based on SODP features leads to a 94.4% accuracy, which indicates significant differences between SODP area values of children with neurotypical development and those diagnosed with ASD. The obtained results have also been emphasized by the analysis of the findings of the performed 3D mapping. © 2018, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.},

abstract={The segregation among benign and malignant nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) from endoscopic images is one of the most challenging issues in cancer diagnosis because of the many conceivable shapes, regions, and image intensities, hence, a proper scientific technique is required to extract the features of cancerous NPC tumors. In the present research, a neural network-based automated discrimination system was implemented for the identification of malignant NPC tumors. In the proposed technique, five different types of qualities, such as local binary pattern, gray-level co-occurrence matrix, histogram of oriented gradients, fractal dimension, and entropy, were first determined from the endoscopic images of NPC tumors and then the following steps were executed: (1) an enhanced adaptive approach was employed as the post-processing method for the classification of NPC tumors, (2) an assessment foundation was created for the automated identification of malignant NPC tumors, (3) the benign and cancerous cases were discriminated by using region growing method and artificial neural network (ANN) approach, and (4) the efficiency of the outcomes was evaluated by comparing the results of ANN. In addition, it was found that texture features had significant effects on isolating benign tumors from malignant cases. It can be concluded that in our proposed method texture features acted as a pointer as well as a help instrument to diagnose the malignant NPC tumors. In order to examine the accuracy of our proposed approach, 159 abnormal and 222 normal cases endoscopic images were acquired from 249 patients, and the classifier yielded 95.66% precision, 95.43% sensitivity, and 95.78% specificity. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins (PITPs) are essential regulators of PLC signalling. The PI transfer domain (PITPd) of multi-domain PITPs is reported to be sufficient for in vivo function, questioning the relevance of other domains in the protein. In Drosophila photoreceptors, loss of RDGBα, a multi-domain PITP localized to membrane contact sites (MCSs), results in multiple defects during PLC signalling. Here, we report that the PITPd of RDGBα does not localize to MCSs and fails to support function during strong PLC stimulation. We show that the MCS localization of RDGBα depends on the interaction of its FFAT motif with dVAP-A. Disruption of the FFAT motif (RDGB FF/AA ) or downregulation of dVAP-A, both result in mis-localization of RDGBα and are associated with loss of function. Importantly, the ability of the PITPd in full-length RDGB FF/AA to rescue mutant phenotypes was significantly worse than that of the PITPd alone, indicating that an intact FFAT motif is necessary for PITPd activity in vivo. Thus, the interaction between the FFAT motif and dVAP-A confers not only localization but also intramolecular regulation on lipid transfer by the PITPd of RDGBα. © 2018.

abstract={Making an accurate diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) disease is a challenging task that involves many parties such as radiology specialists often times need to delineate NPC boundaries on various tumor-bearing endoscopic images. It is a tedious and time-consuming operation exceedingly based on doctors and experience of radiologist. NPC has complex and irregular structures which makes it difficult to diagnose even by an expert physician. However, the diagnosis accuracy results of such methods are still insignificant and need improvement in order to manifest robust solution. The study aim is to develop and propose a new automatic classification of NPC tumor using machine learning techniques and feature-based decision-level fusion scheme from endoscopic images. We have implemented the fusion of the three image texture-based schemes (local binary patterns, the first-order statistics histogram properties, and histogram of gray scale) at the decision level and tested the performance of this scheme using the same experimental setup in the previous section for simple score-level fusion, but for comparison, We used the classifiers methods which are support vector machines (SVM), k-nearest neighbors’ algorithm, and artificial neural network (ANN). The results demonstrate that the majority rule for decision-based fusion is outperformed considerably by the single best performing feature scheme (FFGF) for the SVM classifier, but for the ANN and KNN classifier it is significantly outperformed by each of the components features. The classifiers approaches were listed a high accuracy of 94.07%, the sensitivity of 92.05%, and specificity of 93.07%. © 2018, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={An automated detection system for Parkinson’s disease (PD) employing the convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed in this study. PD is characterized by the gradual degradation of motor function in the brain. Since it is related to the brain abnormality, electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are usually considered for the early diagnosis. In this work, we have used the EEG signals of twenty PD and twenty normal subjects in this study. A thirteen-layer CNN architecture which can overcome the need for the conventional feature representation stages is implemented. The developed model has achieved a promising performance of 88.25% accuracy, 84.71% sensitivity, and 91.77% specificity. The developed classification model is ready to be used on large population before installation of clinical usage. © 2018, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.},

abstract={The pituitary function is regulated by a complex system involving the hypothalamus and biological networks within the pituitary. Although the hormones secreted from the pituitary have been well studied, comprehensive analyses of the pituitary proteome are limited. Pituitary proteomics is a field of postgenomic research that is crucial to understand human health and pituitary diseases. In this context, we report here a systematic proteomic profiling of human anterior pituitary gland (adenohypophysis) using high-resolution Fourier transform mass spectrometry. A total of 2164 proteins were identified in this study, of which 105 proteins were identified for the first time compared with high-throughput proteomic-based studies from human pituitary glands. In addition, we identified 480 proteins with secretory potential and 187 N-terminally acetylated proteins. These are the first region-specific data that could serve as a vital resource for further investigations on the physiological role of the human anterior pituitary glands and the proteins secreted by them. We anticipate that the identification of previously unknown proteins in the present study will accelerate biomedical research to decipher their role in functioning of the human anterior pituitary gland and associated human diseases.
