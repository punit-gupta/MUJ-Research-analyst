abstract={The aim of this study is to select significant features that contribute for accuracy in classification. Data mining is a field where we find lots of data which can be useful or useless in any form available in Data Warehouse. Implementing classification on these huge, uneven, useless data sets with large number of features is just a waste of time degrading the efficiency of classification algorithms and hence the results are not much accurate. Hence we propose a system in which we first use PCA (Principal Component Analysis) for selection of the attributes on which we perform Classification using Bayes theorem, Multi-Layer Perceptron, Decision tree J48 which indeed has given us better result than that of performing Classification on the huge complete data sets with all the attributes. Also association rule mining using traditional Apriori algorithm is experimented to find out sub set of features related to class label.

abstract={A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) consists of one or more sinks and large number of sensor nodes scattered in an area. It is a collection of sensor nodes are interconnected by wireless communication channels. Wireless sensor networks will be used for such tasks as surveillance, widespread environmental sampling, security and health monitoring. With this data simple computations are carried out and communicate with other sensor nodes or controlling authorities in the network. Most of the time the sensor nodes are designed with limited energy, as a result the sensor nodes lacks recharging issues. But still wireless nodes packet-based computation is preferred since it is generally known that the computation utilizes reduced energy than the communication. In this study focus about to control the congestion and each node can achieve fair throughput whenever the congestion occurs in WSN environment. The congestion traffic is found in two streams, named downstream traffic and upstream traffic. The downstream traffic from the sink to the wireless sensor nodes is a one-to-many communication model. We present two general approaches to control congestion, network resource management and traffic control. The first approach tries to increase network resource to mitigate congestion when it occurs. The second approach tries for power control and multiple radio interfaces. It can be used to increase bandwidth and weaken congestion. When congestion occurs, the long-rage radio is used as a more direct route or "siphon" to mitigate congestion. © Maxwell Scientific Organization, 2013.},

abstract={To develop an efficient image fusion algorithm based on visual attention model for images with distinct objects. Image fusion is a process of combining complementary information from multiple images of the same scene into an image, so that the resultant image contains a more accurate description of the scene than any of the individual source images. The two basic fusion techniques are pixel level and region level fusion. Pixel level fusion deals with the operations on each and every pixel separately. The various pixel level techniques are averaging, stationary wavelet transforms, discrete wavelet transforms, Principal Component Analysis (PCA). But because of less sensitivity to noise and mis-registration, the region level image fusion is an emerging approach in the field of multifocus image fusion. The most appreciated approaches in region-based methods are multifocus image fusion using the concept of focal connectivity and spatial frequency. These two methods works well on still images as well as on video frames as inputs. A new region based technique is been proposed for the multifocus images having distinct objects. The method is based on the visual attention models and results obtained are appreciating for the distinct objects input images. The Proposed method results are highlighted using tenengrade and extended spatial frequency as performance parameters by taking several pairs of multi-focus input images like microscopic images, forensic images and video frames. © Maxwell Scientific Organization, 2013.},

UV-visible spectroscopy and scanning electron microscope study reveals the formation of silver nanoparticles which was predominately spherical shape in the range of 2-20 nm and polydispersed. Silver nanoparticles exhibit enhanced antiquorum sensing and antibacterial activity on selected pathogens. Furthermore, antagonistic activity of amoxicillin, methicillin and ampicillin were increased in the combination of silver nanoparticles against the selected human pathogenic strains. The silver nanoparticles would be alternative strategies for treating the bacterial infection caused by multi-drugs resistance bacteria in upcoming era.},

abstract={Computer system architecture is a combination of processor, different levels of memory and peripheral devices. The memory in a computer determines the stability and efficiency. The different layers of the memory hierarchy can be distinguished by the response time and potentiality to withstand the data. The upper layer of the hierarchy is the main memory, which is expected to be fast, non volatile and should able to withstand higher number of write cycles. DRAMS are being used currently, which fails in the case of non volatility. Hence the research on non-volatile memories is at full swing. The introduction of PCM (phase change memory) is considered to be a major achievement in non volatile memory. But the major drawback with PCM is the lesser life time or ability to withstand minimal number of write cycles, longer write time and high power utilization during writes. This paper proposes an architectural framework to exploit the best out of both memories, in which PCM will share the load of the DRAM. This proposed architecture will deliver the expected main memory layer with higher speed, non volatile nature and higher lifetime. © IDOSI Publications, 2013.},

abstract={The main aim of this study is to inject insulin for type 1 diabetes using pumping of insulin. The blood glucose level has to be monitored with the help of glucose tolerance test. For efficient method to control type 1 diabetes researcher will use embedded linear parameter varying methodology controller. In this study, there are three things researchers need to focus. The first is the sensor values read from the sensors has to be monitored and the second is the lab information (patient's basic level of tests). Depending on the patients test details, the insulin has to be injected. For example, if the person sensor value is greater than the reference limit then he has to be provided with insulin for a longer period. So, the comparison of lab details with the patients current sensor values play a vital role in determining the insulin level for a patient. Finally, the feedback has to be obtained with the help of those comparisons and it has to be sent once again as a loop to the controller for later comparison and also for database information. Here, the controller is the key element for updating all the information about the patient and it will control all the parameters of the board. Here, researchers will use EEPROM for saving all the data on a location basis.

abstract={The objective in wound management is to heal the wound in the shortest time possible, without infection and fast wound closure.This investigation is to check the rationale behind the traditional use of leaves of Wrightia tinctoria by evaluating the wound healing property of formulated ointment containing Wrightia tinctoria which may facilitate in vivo quantification of skin curative property of the ointment.Controlled wound healing efficacy studies were done on Guinea pig model with incision and excision wounds. Suitable ointment base was selected by Preformulation studies. The ointment was prepared by melt pour and mixing technique with incorporation of Wrightia tinctoria extract in coconut oil. The wound healing effects of the formulations were compared to that of 0.2% w/w nitrofurazone ointment. A better healing pattern with complete wound closure was observed with the treated groups in contrast to the control group. The total epithelization period was 14 days (allopathic control and Wrightia tinctoria ointment) with 19 days for ointment base. The wound contraction to 50% took 6.3 days (allopathic control), 6.5 days (Wrightia tinctoria ointment), against 12.7 days for ointment base. The tensile strength of the test was almost the same as standard ointment. Increased wound breaking strength indicates increase in collagen strength and obviously facilitating wound healing, thus proving that Wrightia tinctoria ointment could be used for wound healing as a safe alternative to synthetic drug ointments.},

abstract={The aim of this paper is speaker recognition of the letter 'zha' in Tamil language, which consists of comparing a speech signal from an unknown speaker to a known speaker. The speech signals of the letter 'zha' of male and female speakers are recognized by the Vector Quantization (VQ) technique called Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients (MFCC). The recorded sampling frequency was at 16 kHz and the bit rate was at 15450 bits per second, where the original bit rate was at 128K bits per second with the help of wave surfer audio tool. The real time recognized output is taken by using Finite Fourier Transform (FFT) and this result is compared by using Mel Frequency Cepstral coefficients and vector Quantization. The speaker recognition system results are analyzed in MATLAB. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={In an efficient design of routing protocols in ad hoc wireless networks, the connected dominating set (CDS) is widely used as a virtual backbone. To construct the CDS with its size as minimum, many heuristic, meta-heuristic, greedy, approximation and distributed algorithmic approaches have been proposed in the recent years. These approaches mostly concentrated on deriving independent set and then constructing the CDS using Steiner tree and also these algorithms perform well only for the graphs having smaller number of nodes and also for the networks that are generated in an one fixed 2D simulation area. This paper provides a novel approach for constructing the CDS, based on the concept of total dominating set and bipartite theory of graphs. Since the total dominating set is the best lower bound for the CDS, the proposed approach reduces the computational complexity to construct the CDS through the number of iterations. Moreover the conducted simulation reveals that the proposed approach finds better solution than the recently developed approaches when all the three important factors of ad hoc network such as number of nodes, transmission radio range and area of network density varies.},

The present work involves the formulation of Triphala churna as tablets by wet granulation method, to increase the stability as single unit dosage form and to mask the bitter taste of the powder. Tamarind seed polysaccharide (TSP) isolated from the kernel of tamarind seeds is used as the binder for the tablet formulation since it is degraded by the enzymes present in the colon region, so that the drug release is more in the lower part of the intestine, which is the site for increased absorption and its pharmacological action. The formulation is optimized by changing the concentration of TSP binder as the variable. The powder and granules are evaluated for pre-formulation parameters and optimized for tablet compression with required hardness. The addition of TSP in tablets show good disintegration in alkaline media with enzymes and ensure complete release of the drug. The microbial load and XRF studies performed for the optimized batch of tablets prove the formulation's sterility, stability and standard limits of metal ions concentration.},

The circle packing problem is one of the variant of cutting and packing problems. We propose four different nature inspired Meta heuristic algorithms for solving this problem. These algorithms are proved to be the best in finding local solutions. The algorithms are based on food foraging process and breeding behavior of some biological species such as bat, bee, firefly and cuckoo. Circle packing problem is one of the NP hard problems. It is very difficult to solve NP hard problems exactly, so the proposed approaches tries to give approximate solution within the stipulated time. The standard benchmark instances are used for comparison, and it is proved that firefly is giving the best solution. © 2013 Springer International Publishing.},

abstract={In this paper, a new approach is adopted to embed an image within an image using a modified Hill cipher method. The secret image is taken and rearranged to form N 2 × 2 matrices. A key matrix of length 2 × 2 is multiplied with all the N matrices and modulo-256 operation is performed. Then the new N matrices are rearranged to form a one-dimensional matrix. Each element of this matrix is converted to its binary value. A cover image is taken and in each of its pixels, the two least significant bits (LSB) are replaced with two bits from the binary matrix successively. While retrieving, the last 2 bits from each cover pixel are taken out, arranged to form a binary matrix and are converted into their respective 8-bit values. This one dimensional array is converted into N 2 × 2 matrices. These matrices are multiplied with the inverse of the key matrix to get the original values. These values are then rearranged appropriately to get the secret image which was transmitted. © Copyright 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

The proposed paper attempts to develop data scalability in a cloud environment by implementing Cloud based Gateway Clustering (CBGC) mechanism with fault tolerant design. The Client accesses the data from the cloud using Cloud core storage gateway, which is an API. This paper proposes a core gateway which is divided into multiple sub virtual gateways to improve the data access speed. Also an enhanced Gateway Cut Detection (GCD) Algorithm is proposed to detect and recover sub-gateway failures and make sub- gateways to be available throughout the communication. The proposed CBGC mechanism with GCD is highly scalable and reliable to cloud resources.},

abstract={The consumer satisfaction towards the services provided by any organization will depend mainly upon the extent of communication with the customers. To be effective in terms of communication, a company must train its own intermediaries to behave in a manner in which the consumers want to behave. Positive staff attitude, sincerity, integrity, and reliability, sensible advice, delivery of promise, reliable delivery of superior quality service, simplicity and ease of doing business, superior after-sales service, reasonable and competent complaints handling policy on the part of the intermediaries are the determinants of customer loyalty. In India, the private sector banks are highly depending on the agencies outside their organization for the enhancement of their business. This is so because; they have found the investment to be cheaper to appoint the franchisees rather than to open their own branches. Private banks need to sell and cross-sell their products though doorstep banking which is achieved by a widespread direct sales force. The compensation of sales personnel depends on the volumes of business they fetch for the bank. To assess the behaviour of intermediaries of ICICI Bank, a survey is conducted with a sample size of 473 customers by administering an interview schedule. The data collected has been analysed with ANOVA single factor to study the impact of intermediaries' behaviour on customer satisfaction and Weighted ANOVA to know the preference of the customers. The results show that, though ICICI Bank is viewed as an immediate service provider, the customers' rate the service of the bank based on the attitude and behaviour of the intermediaries. This study is applicable to all service sectors like insurance, tourism, hospitality and computer education institutions operating with the marketing intermediaries.},

A general decrease in the viscosity of oils is observed with increase in temperature and the difference in the variation in terms of percentage of adulteration is also studied. An empirical correlation between viscosity and temperature is also determined so as to predict viscosity and adulteration in oil at intermediate temperatures. The changes in the quality of olive oil is premeditated from the changes in the parameters such as viscosity, density, ultrasonic velocity, acoustic impedance, adiabatic compressibility and intermolecular free length, from which the adulteration in the oil can be easily perceived compared to analytical techniques.},

As the baby cannot take any cadence to save its life or prevent itself from drowning, special note of importance is concentrated. Once the baby starts going below certain threshold value in the water level an alarm will be automatically set to ringing state. This will help the family members to save the tot before something fatal occurs. SVM classifier is used for the purpose of classification.

Most of the previous experiments were done in either a straight rectangular structure or with 90° bend. In this paper, different shapes of spur dike are investigated to understand the drag, backwater, reduction in the velocity of flow in the upstream side. Experiments were conducted in laboratory level flume with six different models with varying discharge in both partially submerged and completely sub- merged conditions. The flow energy, velocity and discharge around the spur dike were calculated from the experimental data. The model structure which gives less drag force and maximum reduction in velocity with minimum backwater effect is identified through the plots between discharge, energy upstream and pressure head with drag coefficient. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Protein Data Bank (PDB) is a freely accessible archive of the 3-D structural data of biological molecules. Structure based studies offers a unique vantage point in inferring the properties of a protein molecule from structural data. This is too big a task to be done manually. Moreover, there is no single tool, software or server that comprehensively analyses all structure-based properties. The objective of the present work is to develop an offline computational toolkit, PDB@ containing in-built algorithms that help categorizing the structural properties of a protein molecule. The user has the facility to view and edit the PDB file to his need. Some features of the present work are unique in itself and others are an improvement over existing tools. Also, the representation of protein properties in both graphical and textual formats helps in predicting all the necessary details of a protein molecule on a single platform. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={Mesoporous materials with pore sizes between 2 and 50 nm have elicited widespread interest in catalysis, separation, adsorption, sensors, and drug delivery applications due to its highly ordered pore size along with high hydrothermal stability and easily modifiable surface functionalities. Fabricating these mesoporous materials as continuous fibers offers exciting vistas for biomedical applications especially in tissue engineering. The aim of the present study was to fabricate, characterize, and evaluate the cellular and gene expression of mesoporous silica with a long ordered fibrous morphology to support regeneration of bone tissue. Tetraethyl orthosilicate, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, and the tri-block copolymer P-123 were subjected to electrospinning to fabricate continuous ordered mesoporous silica nanofibers by optimizing solution and operation parameters. Mesoporous silica fibers with an average diameter of 470 nm and mesopores of dimension 5.97 nm were obtained. The combination of micropores, mesopores, macropores, and the nanofibrous morphology imparted excellent bioactivity to the mesoporous silica fibrous scaffolds as demonstrated by the proliferation of human osteoblast-like cells (MG63) and by the maintenance of its phenotype. The upregulation of collagen I, alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, osteopontin, and bone sialoprotein signifies the maturation of MG63 cells on the silica scaffold. Hence, these novel scaffolds are promising new biomaterials for orthopaedic applications. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Introduction: The worldwide increased bacterial resistance to antibiotics and the undesirable side effects associated with constant use of synthetic drugs has prompted the search for novel antimicrobial agents, particularly those manufactured from plants. This study is designed to ascertain the antibacterial potential of Rhus succedanea leaf gall extracts on the growth of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Methods: The methanolic and hexane extract of different concentrations (100, 250, and 500 μg/ml) were prepared and their antibacterial efficacy was tested against clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Micrococcus luteus, and Staphylococcus aureus using agar well diffusion method and the size of inhibition zone was measured in millimeters. Results: The methanol and hexane extracts differed significantly in their antimicrobial activity with methanol extract showing a potent inhibitory activity in the range of 16±2 to 23±1, which was almost equal to the values of ciprofloxacin (25±3), used as a standard. Further, the methanol extract was mostly potent and effective in inhibiting the growth of gram-negative bacteria, namely, E. coli, when compared to gram -positive bacteria stains, which are responsible for antimicrobial activities. The phytochemical screening showed positive results for the presence of steroids, triterpenes, alkaloids, and carbohydrates. Conclusion: The potent antibacterial activity of Rhus succedanea leaf gall extracts indicates its useful therapeutic application against bacterial infection. Furthermore, this study indicates that the extract might be exploited as natural drug for the treatment of infectious diseases and could be useful in understanding the relations between traditional cures and current medications. © 2013 by Tabriz University of Medical Sciences.},

abstract={The proper mixing of nanoscale fillers in conventional dielectric materials leads to an enhancement in the breakdown strength and voltage endurance. In this study experimental investigations are carried out to compare the breakdown characteristics of epoxy nano-composites with that of a base epoxy resin under the influence of divergent electric fields so as to obtain inferences on its breakdown performances. This would in turn enable providing solutions to acquire more effective electrical insulation systems and explore the prospect of tapping the merits of utilizing the rapid strides made in field of fabrication of nano-dielectrics. The main objective is such studies are to enhance the electrical properties of the epoxy dielectric by employing nano-fillers such as SiO2, TiO2 etc. This research envisages the use of epoxy resin mixed with nano-fillers for ascertaining the ability of the nano-composite to be utilized as a dielectric/ insulator in power apparatus. The epoxy resin is mixed with appropriate proportion of SiO2 and TiO2 and experimentation is carried out under the influence of divergent electric fields. Classical breakdown voltage withstand tests such as AC power frequency, DC voltage, lightning impulse and switching impulse test is carried out on epoxy dielectrics (with and without nano-fillers) and the results are compared. In addition, a non-classical breakdown voltage test (high frequency high voltage) is also devised to analyze and ascertain the breakdown characteristics due to varying frequencies so as to investigate the possibility of utilizing such nano-composites in applications related to high speed switching devices.},

abstract={Fabrication of wear resistant and low friction carbon films on the engineered substrates is considered as a challenging task for expanding the applications of diamond-like carbon (DLC) films. In this paper, pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique is used to deposit DLC films on two different types of technologically important class of substrates such as silicon and AISI 304 stainless steel. Laser power density is one of the important parameter used to tailor the fraction of sp2 bonded amorphous carbon (a-C) and tetrahedral amorphous carbon (ta-C) made by sp3 domain in the DLC film. The I(D)/I(G) ratio decreases with the increasing laser power density which is associated with decrease in fraction of a-C/ta-C ratio. The fraction of these chemical components is quantitatively analyzed by EELS which is well supported to the data obtained from the Raman spectroscopy. Tribological properties of the DLC are associated with chemical structure of the film. However, the super low value of friction coefficient 0.003 is obtained when the film is predominantly constituted by a-C and sp2 fraction which is embedded within the clusters of ta-C. Such a particular film with super low friction coefficient is measured while it was deposited on steel at low laser power density of 2 GW/cm2. The super low friction mechanism is explained by low sliding resistance of a-C/sp2 and ta-C clusters. Combination of excellent physical and mechanical properties of wear resistance and super low friction coefficient of DLC films is desirable for engineering applications. Moreover, the high friction coefficient of DLC films deposited at 9GW/cm2 is related to widening of the intergrain distance caused by transformation from sp2 to sp3 hybridized structure. © 2013 Author(s).},

abstract={Objective: To investigate the protective role of the Tinospora cordifolia root extract against cisplatin induced nephrotoxicity in albino rats. Methods: In the present study, the ethanol extract of roots of T. cordifolia (200mg & 400mg/kgbd.wt) was examined for its protective effect against cisplatin induced renal injury in rats. Thirty healthy male and female albino rats (150-200g weight) were chosen and divided into five groups. Vehicle, cisplatin and ethanolic extract were given according to the experimental design. After 8 days of treatment, urinary functional parameters were analysed. Results: Histopathological characters were examined after scarifying and dissecting the rats. Cisplatin (6mg/kg) alone significantly elevated serum markers level, increased urinary protein excretion, reduced urine to serum creatinine ratio and creatinine clearance. In curative regimen, the extract significantly reduced the elevated serum creatinine and urea levels. Renal antioxidant defense systems, such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxides activities and reduced glutathione level, depleted by cisplatin therapy were restored to normal by treatment with the extract. Conclusion: The present investigation suggests that the hydro alcoholic extract of roots of T.cordifolia has protective effect against cisplatin induced nephrotoxicity. © 2013 JPR Solutions.},

abstract={The weld defects in nuclear power plants and petrochemical industries may cause disaster if undetected at the initial stage of installation. Identifying the defects in radiographic images by human interpreter or automated programs is a challenging task due to the presence of various noises and the highly dark nature of the industrial radiography. This paper proposes a new advanced fast processing Median filter for noise removal and also proposes an enhanced method of segmentation using Hough Transform for a restricted triangular region. A novel improvement for the Dijkstra's three way partitioning technique for sorting pixels of an image faster in less number of swaps when compared to the Bentley McIlory algorithm and the Dijkstra's algorithm, is used for designing a fast processing median filter for noise removal. The Hough transform is a reliable technique that can be used for segmenting lack of Penetration weld defect which is basically straight line in nature. In Hough Transform based segmentation the entire image is processed for accumulating votes in an array of accumulator. But the main limitation is its high computational complexity and the large amount of memory that needed to be allocated while processing. Experimental results show that the Hough Transform applied on the restricted triangular region provides an accurate segmentation of lack of penetration weld defect with reduced search space.},

abstract={The east coast of Tamil Nadu, particularly Chennai-Nagapattinam was worstly affected by the 2004 tsunami. Run-up shows remarkable variation of 2-8 m with maximum at Cuddalore port and minimum at Marina beach. Factors like width of dislocation, source distance, orientation of the coastline, and bathymetry guide tsunami surge. While most of the parameters are similar in characteristics for the entire coast, it is presumed that variation in bathymetry have played an imperative role in guiding run-up. Based on gradient bathymetry, up to 50 km off the coast was classified into five classes, viz shallow, moderate, and steep continental slope and continental shelf. Statistical analysis was performed between offshore bathymetry and run-up. The results clearly indicate that moderate slopes have guided tsunami to attain maximum height. While steeper slope have acted as barriers and gentle slopes have shoaled tsunami surge resulting in reduced run-up height. The study offers early but potentially meaningful guidance on the role of bathymetry on run-up. © 2012 Saudi Society for Geosciences.},

abstract={Gels are a relatively newer class of dosage form created by entrapment of large amounts of aqueous or hydro alcoholic liquid in a network of colloidal solid particles. Gel formulations generally provide faster drug release compared with conventional ointments and creams. In spite of many advantages of gels, a major limitation is in the difficulty in delivery of hydrophobic drugs. So to overcome these limitations, emulgels are prepared. When gels and emulsions are used in combined form, the dosage forms are referred as Emulgels. Emulsions possess a certain degree of elegance and are easily washed off whenever desired. They also have a high ability to penetrate the skin. Emulgels for dermatological use have several favourable properties such as being thixotropic, greaseless, easily spreadable, easily removable, emollient, non-staining, water-soluble, longer shelf life, bio-friendly, transparent & pleasing appearance. Other important factor is to extend the drug release of even hydrophilic drugs by making w/o emulgel.},

abstract={Since the introduction of public-key cryptography by Diffe and Hellman in 1976, the potential for the use of the discrete logarithm problem in public-key cryptosystems has been recognized. Although the discrete logarithm problem as first employed by Diffe and Hellman was defined explicitly as the problem of finding logarithms with respect to a generator in the multiplicative group of the integers module a prime, this idea can be extended to arbitrary groups and in particular, to elliptic curve groups. The resulting public - key systems provide relatively small block size, high speed, and high security. In the present paper we define a metric on the fundamental group of elliptic curve over the Galois field GF(25). The fact that defining a new metric among the elliptic curves has potential application in the theory of cryptography; especially to thwart fixed table attack. © 2013 Academic Publications, Ltd.},

abstract={Chitosan is a natural polysaccharide that has attracted significant scientific interest during the last two decades and chitosan based nanodrug delivery systems seem to be a hopeful and viable strategy for improving disease treatment. This study aims to evaluate the potency of the polymer based nanochloroquine in application for attenuation of Plasmodium berghei infection in Swiss mice and effectiveness against the parasite induced oxidative stress and deoxyribo nucleic acid (DNA) damage in lymphocytes. Nanoparticle was prepared by ionotropic gelation between chitosan and sodium tripolyphosphate. The chloroquine was treated by the actual drug content of effective nanochloroquine and the nanodrug was charged with its effective dose for fifteen days, after successive infection development in Swiss mice. Gimsa staining of thin smear and flow cytometry analysis was pursued to reveal the parasitemia. Different oxidative markers, inflammatory markers, antioxidant enzymes level and also lymphocytic deoxyribo nucleic acid damage study were performed. The present study reveals the potency of the nanodrug which has been found as more prospective than only chloroquine treatment to combat the parasite infection, oxidative stress as well as inflammation and DNA damage. From the study, we conclude this nanodrug may be applicable as potent therapeutic agent than only chloroquine. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Background: Marine environment is inestimable for their chemical and biological diversity and therefore is an extraordinary resource for the discovery of new anticancer drugs. Recent development in elucidation of the mechanism and therapeutic action of natural products helped to evaluate for their potential activity.Methods: We evaluated Gracilaria edulis J. Ag (Brown algae), for its antitumor potential against the Ehrlich ascites tumor (EAT) in vivo and in vitro. Cytotoxicity evaluation of Ethanol Extract of Gracilaria edulis (EEGE) using EAT cells showed significant activity. In vitro studies indicated that EEGE cytotoxicity to EAT cells is mediated through its ability to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and therefore decreasing intracellular glutathione (GSH) levels may be attributed to oxidative stress.Results: Apoptotic parameters including Annexin-V positive cells, increased levels of DNA fragmentation and increased caspase-2, caspase-3 and caspase-9 activities indicated the mechanism might be by inducing apoptosis. Intraperitoneally administration of EEGE to EAT-bearing mice helped to increase the lifespan of the animals significantly inhibited tumor growth and increased survival of mice. Extensive hematology, biochemistry and histopathological analysis of liver and kidney indicated that daily doses of EEGE up to 300 mg/kg for 35 days are well tolerated and did not cause hematotoxicity nor renal or hepatotoxicity.Conclusion: Comprehensive antitumor analysis in animal model and in Ehrlich Ascites Tumor cells was done including biochemical, and pathological evaluations indicate antitumor activity of the extract and non toxic in vivo. It was evident that the mechanism explains the apoptotic activity of the algae extract. © 2013 Patra and Muthuraman; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={An electrochemical biosensor was developed to determine lactate that plays an important role in clinical diagnosis, fermentation and food quality analysis. Abnormal concentration of lactate has been related to diseases such as hypoxia, acute heart disorders, lactic acidosis, muscle fatigue and meningitis. Also, lactate concentration in blood helps to evaluate the athletic performance in sports. The main aim of the work is to fabricate NADH/LDH/Nano-CeO2/GCE bio-electrode for sensing lactate in human blood samples. Toward this, CeO2 nanoparticles were synthesized by a hydroxide mediated approach using cerium nitrate hexahydrate (Ce(NO3)3{dot operator}6H2O) and NaOH as precursors. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM) studies were carried out to determine the structural and morphological characteristics of CeO2 nanoparticles. XRD pattern indicated the formation of highly crystalline CeO2 nanoparticles with face centered cubic structure. The FE-SEM studies revealed the formation of nanospherical particles of size 29.73±2.59nm. The working electrode was fabricated by immobilizing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) on GCE surface with CeO2 nanoparticles as an interface. Electrochemical studies were carried out through cyclic voltammetry using a three electrode system with NADH/LDH/NanoCeO2/GCE as a working electrode, Ag/AgCl saturated with 0.1M KCl as a reference electrode and Pt wire as a counter electrode. From the amperometric study, the linearity was found to be in the range of 0.2-2mM with the response time of less than 4s. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Moreover many of the existing tools that appraise the web pages are not capable of evaluating the operation and quality of a webpage and amongst those tools most of them focus on predicting the functionality and accessibility characteristics of a quality model. Hence the Usability quality characteristics of the quality model have been analyzed and a study has been made on the quality metrics for the various websites. Based on the studied quality metrics, a training set has been made for predicting the quality characteristics of the websites using the various classification methodologies like Bayes theorem, Conditional probability, Tree induction etc. This paper mainly proposes a Quality evaluation tool for evaluating the usability characteristic and predicting the quality level of that characteristic through Bayes theorem and Tree Induction.

abstract={The rheological characteristics of ZnO-propylene glycol nanofluid have been studied over a temperature range of 10-140 C and nanoparticle concentration range of 0-2 vol%. The addition of ZnO nanoparticles (35-40 nm) to propylene glycol (PG) weakens the inter-molecular hydrogen bonding in propylene glycol. This is reflected in the reduced values of viscosity for nanoparticle dispersions (nanofluids) compared to that of base fluid. The viscosity decrease is more pronounced at lower temperatures and at higher nanoparticle concentration. The percentage reduction in viscosity is 53 and 32 % at 10 and 28 C, respectively, for 2 vol% ZnO-propylene glycol nanofluid compared to pure PG. This dispersion has immense potential for cooling application owing to lower viscosity. At high temperatures where the hydrogen bonds in the base fluid are substantially weaker, viscosity of ZnO-PG dispersions is higher than that of PG. An estimated 80 and 37 % enhancement in heat transfer coefficient can be achieved using 2 vol% ZnO-PG nanofluid at temperatures of 10 and 28 C, respectively. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={Steganography is the art of concealing data within data in such a way that it is almost untraceable. Out of the multitude of information carriers, digital images are the most popular ones used in steganography. Various techniques of concealing information exist for various kinds of applications. Every application calls for different requirements and appropriate techniques have to be chosen accordingly. Steganography contributes vastly to the field of security and helps to lessen foul play or breach of information sharing rules. Embedding a small amount of pixel information of an original image into a larger image where each of its pixels contains information related to the original image makes it almost difficult to retrieve the actual information. The reverse process points towards the decompression of the larger image until the original information is found. This type of process uses LSB technique of pixel embedding and is widely used for a variety of applications. It serves the dual purpose of securing vital information by obscuring it in addition to compressing the image information for resourceful use of memory. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) is now being a solution for packet switched networks. The future generation network is amalgamating the infrastructure of Wireless/wireline for providing the standard interface for Internet services. Nevertheless, the network infrastructures like multimedia and non-multimedia do not have any native mechanism to interpret the key schema of client media tools to establish the communication such as voice and data. To establish, as such services, a signaling protocol of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is being put to use to control the communication on Internet for establishing, Maintaining and terminating the communication session. Many papers have been proposed for authentication and authorization for securing the communication media. However, so far, no paper has been proposed for interpreting the built-in schema of multimedia tools. Thus we propose the Interoperation Key Schema to successfully exchange the mismatched schema between media client and server. Also we analyze the proposed mechanism with Internet security systems of Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) and Transport Layer Security (TLS). We deploy a real time platform of multimedia to examine the interoperation success rate and call setup time between the media clients. © 2013 Engineering and Technology Publishing.},

abstract={Tag recommender schemes suggest related tags for an untagged resource and better tag suggestions to tagged resources. Tagging is very important if the user identifies the tag that is more precise to use in searching interesting blogs. There is no clear information regarding the meaning of each tag in a tagging process. An user can use various tags for the same content, and he can also use new tags for an item in a blog. When the user selects tags, the resultant metadata may comprise homonyms and synonyms. This may cause an improper relationship among items and ineffective searches for topic information. The collaborative tag recommendation allows a set of freely selected text keywords as tags assigned by users. These tags are imprecise, irrelevant, and misleading because there is no control over the tag assignment. It does not follow any formal guidelines to assist tag generation, and tags are assigned to resources based on the knowledge of the users. This causes misspelled tags, multiple tags with the same meaning, bad word encoding, and personalized words without common meaning. This problem leads to miscategorization of items, irrelevant search results, wrong prediction, and their recommendations. Tag relevancy can be judged only by a specific user. These aspects could provide new challenges and opportunities to its tag recommendation problem. This paper reviews the challenges to meet the tag recommendation problem. A brief comparison between existing works is presented, which we can identify and point out the novel research directions. The overall performance of our ontology-based recommender systems is favorably compared to other systems in the literature. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The films were characterized for their structural, morphological and electrical properties using X-ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) and resistance/capacitance measurement by LCR-Z meter. The grain size of the films increased with increase in the substrate temperature, which in turn reduced the defects. Due to this the resistance of the films decreased. The fabricated capacitor using the Cu film, exhibited different capacitance values with respect to the flow of fluid in the capillary tube. © 2013 IEEE.},

Several virulence factors are important for disease manifestation in APEC of which, role of quorum sensing has not been investigated. Quorum sensing is a population dependent cell-cell signaling system which modulates numerous physiological processes such as biofilm formation and virulence in multiple species. LuxS, a well-known controller in the QS, plays a role in regulating virulence in various bacterial species. Here we investigated the role of LuxS in regulating virulence in APEC O78:K80:H9. Mutation of luxS resulted in a significant reduction of virulence in APEC O78:K80:H9, evidenced by both in vivo and in vitro assays such as decreased invasion of internal organs in chicken embryo, reduced lethality in chicken embryo lethality assay, and altered lipopolysaccharide (LPS) profile. In addition, the abilities of the knockout strain to survive in chicken macrophage cell lines and to invade in chicken embryo fibroblast cells were significantly diminished. Further, structure and expression level of the LPS profile was significantly altered in the knockout strain, which may be one of the contributing factors for the persistence and virulence of APEC. Complementation of luxS gene in trans restored the virulence of the knockout strain to the level of wild-type bacteria. Taken together, these results show that LuxS contributes to the virulence in APEC O78:K80:H9 strain and partly explain the role played by LuxS in the pathogenesis of APEC strains. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Sleep apnea is a dishevelment that causes interruption in breath or shoal of the respiration. The respiratory signal is classified into three states such as normal respiration, motion artifacts, and sleep apnea and it is obtained from a physionet. Firstly, using a second order auto regressive modeling, an algorithm is developed to attain the energy and frequency parameters of the signal and then the signal is classified with threshold based manual classification into any of the above taxonomy. In addition to this dataset, MLP is trained with a back propagation learning algorithm that results in reduced time, iterations and errors. Consequently, the training of SVM, a binary classifier used to solve multiple class problems is done with the same data set and classification is made to reduce overall errors. The overall efficiency of the above techniques is compared.},

The antioxidative property was determined on the basis of total phenol content in the six honey samples and their antiradical scavenging activity (DPPH assay). From the honey samples analysed, honey sample AP3 was found to have maximum antioxidative property. The total phenol content of honey sample AP3 was found to be 1.1 mg/L and the antiradical scavenging activity was found to be about 63.63%. Hence further honey sample AP3 was subjected to LC/MS analysis in order to know its composition. From the LC/MS analysis it was found that honey sample AP3 contains L- ethionine, N- acetyl glycine, oxamic acid, succinimide, xanthurenic acid, brivudin, histidine, quisqualic acid, quanosine and sissotrine. As the honey sample AP3 has significant antioxidative property, it can act as a good antimicrobial agent, effective wound healer which has no side effects, food preservative which is rich in nutrition. © IDOSI Publications, 2013.},

abstract={Objective: Phytase is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of phytic acid. It is a class of phosphatase enzyme and finds use as a major animal feed supplement. In this study the effect of culture conditions for the maximum production of Phytase was assessed from a phytase producing bacteria which is screened and isolated from poultry faeces. Methods: After the initial screening procedure, it was found that three isolates were able to hydrolyze sodium phytate. Batch production studies were carried out by varying carbon, nitrogen and phosphate sources and varying physical conditions of temperature and pH. Results: Amongst those three isolates, Pseudomonas fluorescens had very high phytate degrading activity. Wheat bran, Yeast extracts and potassium dihydrogen phosphate at pH 6 was identified as the better carbon, nitrogen and phosphate sources respectively. The enzyme was stable with CaCl2 at temperature 40-50°C and pH 6-7. Scaled up production was carried out in a 3L bioreactor and the enzyme activity found to be 32.94 U/ml. The phytase enzyme was partially purified by ammonium sulphate precipitation at 50% saturation resulting in a yield of 48.6%. Further purification was carried out using Gel filtration chromatography with a yield of 26.77%. Conclusion: The results show that the maximum production of phytase is from Pseudomonas fluorescens in a 3L fermenter at pH-6, 72 hours, using wheat bran, yeast extract, potassium dihydrogen phosphate as carbon, nitrogen and phosphate sources respectively and the enzyme activity was found to be 32.94U/ml at the optimized conditions.},

AgNPs synthesized using fresh neem leaf extracts (NF-AgNPs) selectively detected Hg2+ whereas sun-dried neem leaf extract based AgNPs (ND-AgNPs) were observed to selectively sense Hg2+ and Pb 2+ at micromolar concentrations. Neem bark extract based AgNPs exhibited selective colorimetric sensing of Hg2+ and Zn2+. Similarly, AgNPs synthesized from mango leaf (fresh, MF-AgNPs; sun-dried, MD-AgNPs) and green tea extracts (GT-AgNPs) showed selective colorimetric sensing of Hg2+ and Pb2+ ions. AgNPs obtained using pepper seed extracts exhibited Hg2+, Pb2+ and Zn2+ selective colorimetric sensor properties. Importantly these green synthesized AgNPs selectively detected the presence of hazardous metal ions in aqueous solutions across a wide range of pH values (2.0-11), which is a highly desirable attribute from the perspective of different sources of water pollution. The selective colorimetric sensing of Hg2+, Pb2+ and Zn 2+ ions by green synthesized AgNPs over a wide pH range demonstrates the multi-functional utility of plant extracts in green nanotechnology and environmental sensor applications. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013.},

abstract={Background: Diabetes mellitus is becoming the commonest non-communicable disease in the world. Strict control of diabetes mellitus is associated with fewer incidences of complications. Screening for control of diabetes is a useful intervention, because diabetes is a highly morbid illness with a long asymptomatic phase. Glycosylated Haemoglob in (HbA1C) is the ideal parameter which can be used to assess the diabetic control, as this parameter is not alterable with single day manipulations. Aims: Our main objective was to find out the mean HbA1C in a random assessment. The other supplementary objectives were to find out the prevalence of hypertension, smoking, obesity, vascular events and hypoglycaemic episodes and any possible correlation with HbA1C values. Methodology: The selection of 100 diabetic patients who reported to the diabetic centre in a randomly selected day was done. They were subjected to a simple questionnaire with on spot HbA1c assessment. The questionnaire described the evidence of vascular events, risk factors, hypoglycaemic episodes, etc. R esults: A mean HbA1C value of 8.91 was found out, which was far higher than the normal (7.0%). The prevalences of other variables coincided with those which were seen in previous studies. The hypoglycaemic episodes were high, but the patients with such episodes had a higher mean HbA1C. This could be possible as our patients consumed sweet and sugar with such events and had higher mean glucose values. It has been suggested that physicians and patients should work synchronously to achieve better diabetic control. The physician should strictly enforce weight reduction and quitting of smoking.},

abstract={The hardware design of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) is the crux of its effective deployment. Nowadays these networks are used in microscopic, secure and high-end embedded products. WSN's potentiality in terms of effcient data sensing and distributed data processing has led to its usage in applications for measurement and tracking. WSN comprises of small number of embedded devices known as sensor nodes, gateways and base stations. Sensor nodes consist of sensors, processors and transceivers. The property of embedded sensor devices, also called motes, is to determine the strength of WSN. Thus processor selection for the motes plays a critical role in determining a WSN's competency. In this article, the absolute and obvious hardware characteristics of available and proposed sensor nodes are discussed. The objective of this work was to increase the effciency and provision of sensor nodes by evaluating their processing and transceiver units. During this work, a sensor node was developed with ARM processor and XBee series 2 Unit. LPC 2148, LPC 2378 ARM processors were posed as processing unit and XBee series 2 acted as communication unit. Results of this experimental setup were recorded. Also a comparative study of the various available sensor nodes and proposed sensor nodes was done extensively. Copyright © 2013, IGI Global.},

abstract={Nanostructured zinc oxide (ZnO) thin film was deposited using spray pyrolysis technique on the glass substrates at the substrate temperature of 523 K. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the as-deposited sample showed the formation of zinc (Zn) dominant thin film. After the annealing process at 523, 623 and 723 K for 6 h in atmosphere, the zinc dominant thin film evolved as poly crystalline zinc oxide thin film with hexagonal wurtzite structure. The field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) image showed the formation of sprouts (also like Agal Villaku) like morphology for the as-deposited film. A considerable change was observed in the morphology of the films after the annealing process. Optical properties of all the samples were studied using UV-vis spectrophotometer and the optical band gap was found to be 3.27 eV. Further, the room temperature ethanol sensing characteristics of the film annealed at 623 K is also reported. © 2013 American Scientific Publishers.},

abstract={Atorvastatin calcium is a class II drug, with low oral bioavailability (14%), primarily used for the treatment of dyslipidemia and also for unstable angina, coronary heart disease, stroke and multiple risk factors for myocardial infarction. The purpose of this research is to formulate Atorvastatin as oral dissolving films to provide an immediate releaseof drug and fast onset of action, thereby improving the bioavailability. The films are prepared by solvent casting method using polymers such as HPMC, PVA and PVP in different composition in addition with propylene glycol as plasticizer. The formulated films are assessed for their physicochemical parameters such as weight, thickness, folding endurance, percentage moisture absorption, surface pH and drug content uniformity. The in-vitro release studies are done in USP dissolution apparatus maintained at the temperature of 37±1oC and the stirring speed of 100 rpm. The optimized films were characterized using thermal analysis by DSC, interaction studies by FTIR and surface morphology by SEM. To increase the percentage of drug release at minimum duration, the drug with β cyclodextrin is prepared as, inclusion complex by kneading method and nanoparticles by emulsification solvent evaporation method, and are incorporated into the films, and further optimized by the evaluation studies.},

abstract={Experiments were performed on the formulation of MWCNT-Propylene glycol nanofluid through acid-treatment of MWCNT followed by ultrasonication. While acid-treatment introduced hydrophilic groups to facilitate dispersion in a polar liquid like propylene glycol, probe ultrasonication contributed to de-agglomeration of large clusters. The viscosity of acid-treated MWCNT-propylene glycol increases non-linearly with MWCNT volume concentration due to high aspect ratio and clustering. The analysis of viscosity and thermal conductivity data as a function of MWCNT concentration and temperature reveal the role of particle clustering in thermal conductivity enhancement. The nanofluid maintains colloidal stability even at temperatures as high as 140 °C. © 2013 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.},

GC-MS analysis of ethanolic extract of S. nigrum and E. officinalis fruits revealed the presence of 51 and 25 phytoconstituents respectively. S. cerevisiae cells cultured in YEPD medium were divided into eight groups of 1X106 cells/ml each. The groups pre-treated with plant extract were subjected to oxidative stress by H2O2. Decreased apoptosis was observed with the yeast cells treated with fruit extract as compared with the cells treated with H2O2 alone. Antioxidant nature of the fruit extracts was determined by assessing SOD and catalase activity in yeast cells. The level of protein, SOD and catalase activity showed significant increase in yeast cells treated with plant extract than H2O2 treated cells. These extracts also protected the cells, its protein and other biomolecules from the oxidative damage, thereby increased the cell viability and stability. The protective mechanism may be due to the phytoconstituents with antioxidant nature and hence these plant fruits could be used as an alternate as therapeutic agents in free radical mediated diseases.},

abstract={Staphylococcus aureus pathogenesis is an intricate process involving a diverse array of extracellular proteins, biofilm and cell wall components that are coordinately expressed in different stages of infection. The expression of two divergent loci, agr and sar, is increasingly recognized as a key regulator of virulence in S. aureus, and there is mounting evidence for the role of these loci in staphylococcal infections. The functional agr regulon is critical for the production of virulence factors, including α, b and d hemolysins. The sar locus encodes SarA protein, which regulates the expression of cell wall-associated and certain extracellular proteins in agr-dependent and agr-independent pathways. Multidrug-resistant S. aureus is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the world and its management, especially in community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus infections, has evolved comparatively little. In particular, no novel targets have been incorporated into its treatment to date. Hence, these loci appear to be the most significant and are currently at the attention of intense investigation regarding their therapeutic prospects. © 2013 Future Medicine Ltd.},

The objective of the current review is to describe the comprehensiveness of the various advanced anti-HIV drug delivery systems and compounds that have been developed for targeting drugs to the macrophages, gastric mucosa and brain. Novel drug delivery system gives an opportunity to bypass the shortcomings related to the anti-retroviral treatment. It helps in addressing towards the complexity of dosage form development such as instability, insolubility and limited entrapment of the drugs. Several optional routes have been identified for the management of the ARV therapy which includes transdermal, mucosal (vaginal, rectal, buccal, etc.) and also lymphatic delivery, with the application of novel systems like nanoparticles, vesicular systems (liposomes, niosomes, ethosomes, emulsomes), micellar assemblies, etc. This review spotlights the prospectives of novel drug release systems used in preventing the transmission and treatment of retroviral infections. © 2013 By IYPF All rights reserved.},

abstract={Artificial neural networks are often used as a powerful discriminating classifier for tasks in medical diagnosis. They have several advantages over parametric classifiers such as discriminate analysis. Acute and Chronic Renal failures or Kidney Diseases (CKD) are being observed as a serious challenge to the field of Medical and health industry with its impact on a mass population of the world. This paper presents an efficient and effective model of forecast and classification of functional abnormalities of kidney using Associative Neural Network (ASNN) and Polynomial Neural Network (PNN). The ASNN and PNN are constructed with neurons arranged in such a way that the network consists of ten, eight and one neurons in the input, hidden and output layers respectively. Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) which can indicate the efficiency of functionality of kidneys is arrived using Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula and the network is trained with these data sets. The trained ASNN and PNN are used for testing and used as an effective model for the forecast, categorization of renal functional abnormalities and severity level of CKD. The result of this study shows that ASNN provides satisfactory results for the diagnosis and classification of kidney dysfunction with excellent correlation co-efficient (R2 = 0.987) for training and 0.951 for testing. In the end part the results are cross validated by Leave-One-Out (LOO) procedure. Correlation coefficient of 0.955for training and 0.958 for testing confirms the classification ability of PNN. The projected model has been proved to be the most reliable tool with high degree of accuracy of its kind in terms of forecasting and classification of renal functionality. The Network model is also useful as an effective tool for the physicians in the diagnosis or screening of CKD, communicating the patients about the risk factor involved in their renal function and deciding the course of therapy and medication.},

abstract={Objective: To find out whether linarin can be used as a potential natural inhibitor to target CDK4 in retinoblastoma using virtual screening studies. Materials and Methods: In this study, molecular modeling and protein structure optimization was performed for crystal structure of CDK4 (PDB id: 3G33), and was subjected to Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation for 10 nanoseconds, as a preparatory process for docking. Furthermore, the stable conformation obtained in the MD simulation was utilized for virtual screening against the library of natural compounds in Indian Plant Anticancer Compounds Database (InPACdb) using AutoDock Vina. Finally, best docked ligands were revalidated individually through semi-flexible docking by AutoDock 4.0. Results: The CDK4 structure was stereochemically optimized to fix clashes and bad angles, which placed 96.4% residues in the core region of Ramachandran plot. The final structure of CDK4 that emerged after MD simulation was proven to be highly stable as per different validation tools. Virtual screening and docking was carried out for CDK4 against optimized ligands from InPACdb through AutoDock Vina. This inferred Linarin (Inpacdb AC.NO. acd0073) as a potential therapeutic agent with binding energy of-8.9 kJ/mol. Furthermore, it was also found to be valid as per AutoDock 4.0 semi-flexible docking procedure, with the binding energy of-8.18 kJ/mol and Ki value of 1.01 μM. Conclusion: The docking results indicate linarin, a flavonoid plant compound, as a potential inhibitor of CDK4 compared to some of the currently practiced anticancer drugs for retinoblastoma. This finding can be extended to experimental validation to assess the in vivo efficacy of the identified compound.},

This method provides more accurate results by dynamically adjusting the computational mesh and scales the CPU time linearly with the number of mesh points using polynomial interpolation, hence reducing the numerical cost.

abstract={In order to ascertain whether autistic children display characteristic metabolic signatures that are of diagnostic value, plasma amino acid analyses were carried out on a cohort of 138 autistic children and 138 normal controls using reverse-phase HPLC. Pre-column derivatization of amino acids with phenyl isothiocyanate forms phenyl thio-carbamate derivates that have a λmax of 254 nm, enabling their detection using photodiode array. Autistic children showed elevated levels of glutamic acid (120 ± 89 vs. 83 ± 35 μmol/L) and asparagine (85 ± 37 vs. 47±19 μ,mol/L); lower levels of phenylalanine (45 ± 20 vs. 59 ± 18 μ,mol/L), tryptophan (24 ± 11 vs. 41 ± 16 μmol/L), methionine (22 ± 9 vs. 28 ± 9 μ,mol/L) and histidine (45 ± 21 vs. 58 ± 15 μ,mol/L). A low molar ratio of (tryptophan/large neutral amino acids) × 100 was observed in autism (5.4 vs 9.2), indicating lesser availability of tryptophan for neurotransmitter serotonin synthesis. To conclude, elevated levels of excitatory amino acids (glutamate and asparagine), decreased essential amino acids (phenylalanine, tryptophan and methionine) and decreased precursors of neurotransmitters (tyro sine and tryptophan) are the distinct characteristics of plasma amino acid profile of autistic children. Thus, such metabolic signatures might be useful tools for early diagnosis of autism.},

Central authority based authentication schemes have been proposed and with every movement of a node outside the network demands re-authentication of the nodes by the central authority before the node rejoins the network. This research contribution intends to propose a novel Non-Interactive Zero Knowledge Protocol (NIZKP) to address this problem of re-authentication. The proposed NIZKP achieves re-authentication by neighborhood authentication of the node that wants to rejoin the network. This reduces the dependences on the central authority for re-authentication thereby avoiding the attacks that are possible during re-authentication. © 2013 Academic Journals Inc.},

abstract={In this study, a steganographic run is espoused for images with LSB as a building block. Living in the world of advanced technologies where zillions of people get connected online every day, problem of cyber crimes has also become inevitable. Since innumerable digital files are exchanged, importance given to problem solving measures has also up risen. For the security of images sake, steganography has introduced many modus operandi which are implementable both commercially and domestically. Steganography involves the hiding of data such that it is invisible to the naked eye and it also aims at hiding the very existence of the message itself by a cover medium which could be image or audio or video. Depending on the need of the user, any type can be used. Image steganography is very prevalent among these three. The choice of the algorithm is driven by parameters such as veracity, sturdiness, capacity and availability. Modified LSB is used in this algorithm but with a different perspective that give adequate implication to all of the previously mentioned. The algorithm is rationalized by means of MSE and PSNR results. © 2013 Academic Journals Inc.},

abstract={Taxation plays a vital role in international operation of firms. It isthe core of various financial decisions, such as international investment decisions, international working capital decisions, funds raising decisions concerning dividend and other payments. It is true that the tax issue is relevant to such decisions also in respect of domestic firms. But, the management of taxation is a highly complex issue for international corporations. There are two types of foreign investment, namely foreign direct investmentand foreign portfolio investment. Pursuing the objectives of utilizing the firms' cash resources most efficiently and minimizing the firms' global taxliability requires the firm to be able to transfer funds from one location to another around the global. International businesses use a number of techniques to transfer liquid funds across borders. These include dividend remittances, royalty payments and fees, transfer prices and fronting loan. The investors are interested in real rates of return net of taxes. The international tax system should be neutral that is it should not affect economic efficiency. At the same time, it has to be equitable ensuring equal sacrificeby different tax payers. Besides, a firm should not be taxed twice for the same income. Some firms use tax havens to minimize their tax liability. TheOECD has published a list of 35 tax havens. So, the OECD is very much concerned to remove the loopholes in the tax system and other obstacles in crossborder trade and investment. ©Medwell Journals, 2013.},

abstract={The last few decades have seen a tremendous growth in computing machines as well as the digital information with internet expansion. The transmission and storage of this huge volume of information is a high priority issue and has lead to the evolvement of information hiding and cryptographic techniques. Cryptography scrambles the message to be transmitted safely and different key sizes implement different security levels. Steganography is an information hiding technique and embeds the information in undetectable files like images or texts such that their very presence is not detected with the naked eyes. Cryptography and steganography have their own advantages and disadvantages and though each is resistant to attacks in their own ways, a combination of both results in a better cryptosystem and is a chief domain of research these days. Completely different from other methods, this paper makes use of the basic traits of statistical distribution given by mean and standard deviation; the basic building block for this paper. Embedding is done by adopting LSB substitution and PI. Bits to be infixed are decided by some prerequisites for increasing ramification. Justification for this algorithm is given by rudimentary of images along with bits per pixel and capacity of embedding. This paper promises high security and enhanced robustness as well. © 2013 Academic Journals Inc.},

abstract={The Internet mostly uses insecure links, where information for communication is put to test through its open exposure to interception. As far as information is concerned, its safeguarding1 measures are of prime concern nowadays. Some solution to be discussed is how to pass the not to be disclosed message in a fashion that its subsistence is made unidentified to invaders. Stenography is a hiding mechanism where the charisma of the secret is veiled by infixing the same in cover files. Steganalysis is the field associated with steganography detection by all its attributes which has now acknowledged much notice from media, law enforcement etc. Chi square test is the one such statistical technique used for steganalysis. This paper purports an algorithm for embedding data within images such that the chi square test fails to detect the hidden information. Merits and demerits of the algorithm are also discussed. Simple LSB substitution along with proposed modified LSB substitution is discussed with the help of PSNR and Chi square value. Another algorithm called as IPMCS (Increased Probability of matching between Cover and Secret data) is introduced which can be used to improve the image quality in terms of PSNR. It is important to know that IPMCS works well only for those images whose PSNR value obtained after applying OPAP is below a threshold value. Stegnographers should obtain stego outputs which when seen from naked eye, are impossible to tell apart from their corresponding covers. © 2013 Academic Journals Inc.},

abstract={In this study, we highlighted a new and efficient steganographic modus operandi based on pixel indicator routine to infix covert data in an RGB image. Usually when pixel indicator technique is employed on an RGB image, only one among the three planes (R, G and B) is labeled the indicant plane and the other two as depository planes in which the data can be stored. The proposed method is a similar concept by considering all the three planes for storage of the data instead of just two. This is carried out by using 5, 6 and 7 bits of a plane as indicator bits which increases the possible fields (from 4-8) to store the data. Because of this, the data embedding capacity of the image is improved to a greater extent since the indicator plane can also be used for embedding data in it. Optical Pixel Adjustment Process (OPAP) is also used here for reducing Mean Square Error. Furthermore the OPAP technique is not applied on the indicator plane as it modifies the indicator bits for reducing the MSE. © 2013 Academic Journals Inc.},

abstract={This study proposes an innovative methodology that incorporates the famous Rubik's cube into steganography. Rubik's cube is a pivot mechanism that enables each face to turn independently thus allowing mixing up of colors. By using this mechanism to represent the three planes of a color image (Red, Green, and Blue) the randomness of the stego image can be improved. The pixel intensity values can additionally be used as pointers to indicate the type of shift that needs to be done to the pixels in three planes. This study contains the experimental results that validate the superiority of this methodology compared to other existing ones in terms of imperceptibility, robustness and with reasonable embedding capacity. It is also found to be more resistant to steganalysis. © 2013 Academic Journals Inc.},

Due to irregular node distribution energy consumption is not a balanced one in cluster-based wireless sensor networks. The proposed system provides techniques to rectify this problem through: (i) Forming Maximal Independent Set (MIS) (ii) Effective Set Head selection (iii) Multi-hop communication. Non adjacency of nodes has been leveraged for creating MIS. Intra-set energy consumption has been reduced by selecting a node as Set Head (SH), which is geographically nearer to all other nodes. Inter Set efficient energy consumption is achieved by using multi-hop communication between SH to BS. The proposed system EECDC forms more efficient and stable sets, which increases the lifetime of sensor networks i.e., Number of data collection rounds.},

abstract={The cerium(IV) ammonium nitrate (CAN)-catalyzed sequential multicomponent reaction between tryptamine, α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, and β-dicarbonyl compounds affords highly substituted indolo[2,3-a]quinolizines in a single synthetic operation. Two rings are generated through the creation of two C-C and two C-N bonds by a domino process comprising initial β-enaminone formation, followed by individual Michael addition, 6-exo-trig cyclization, iminium formation, and Pictet-Spengler steps. Furthermore, the reaction is diastereoselective and affords exclusively compounds with a trans relationship between the H-2 and H-12b protons. The use of amines bearing a less nucleophilic side chain aromatic ring (5-bromotryptamine, 3,4- dimethoxyphenylethylamine) prevents the Pictet-Spengler final step and leads to N-indolylethyl or N-phenylethyl-1,4-dihydropyridines, which are cyclized to the corresponding indolo[2,3-a]quinolizines or benzo[a]quinolizines in the presence of HCl in methanol/water. Treatment of the fused quinolizine derivatives with sodium triacetoxyborohydride led to the corresponding indolo[2,3-a] quinolizidines or benzo[a]quinolizidines, possessing four stereogenic centers, as mixtures of two diastereomers. One operation, four bonds: The cerium(IV) ammonium nitrate (CAN)-catalyzed reaction between tryptamine, α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, and β-dicarbonyl compounds affords indolo[2,3-a]quinolizines in a single operation (see scheme).

Each MD simulation was performed for 25ns and trajectory structures stored at every 25ps were used to probe various structural events occurring in the temperature-induced unfolding of the proteins. Notwithstanding their similar scaffolds, the two proteins are drastically differing in their unfolding stabilities from each other. The structural orders of flexibilities for the CTX1 and LNTX2 were found to be loop II>loop III>loop I>C-terminal and C-terminal>loop I>loop III>loop II, respectively. Based on the comprehensive analyses of the simulation data and studies on the various structural interactions of all cardiotoxins (CTXs) and alpha-neurotoxins (NTXs) for which three-dimensional structures determined by experimental techniques are available to date, we have herein proposed a hypothesis ('CN network') rationalizing the differential stabilities of the CTXs and NTXs belonging to a three-finger toxin superfamily of snake venoms. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={TRPV1 (Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid Type 1) receptor, a member of Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid subfamily of ion channels, occurs in the peripheral and central nervous system, and plays a key role in transmission of pain. Consequently, this has been the target for discovery of several pain relieving agents which have undergone clinical trials. Though several TRPV1 antagonists have progressed to become clinical candidates, many are known to cause temperature elevation in humans, halting their further advancement, and signifying the need for new chemotypes. Different chemical classes of TRPV1 antagonists share three important features: an amide or an isostere flanked by an aromatic (or fused aromatic) ring with polar substitutions on one side, and a hydrophobic group on the other. Recent work identified new series of compounds with these and additional features, leading to improvement of properties, and development of clinical candidates. Herein, we describe a 3D-QSAR model (n = 62; R2 = 0.9 and Q2 = 0.75) developed from the piperazinyl-aryl series of compounds and a novel 5-point pharmacophore model is shown to fit several diverse scaffolds, six clinical candidates, five pre-clinical candidates and three lead compounds.

abstract={People started to replace natural aggregate with recycled aggregate for a number of years due to disposal problem and certain other potential benefits. Though there are number of drawbacks with use of recycled aggregates like lesser modulus of elasticity, low compressive strength, increase in shrinkage, there are results of earlier studies that use of chemical and mineral admixtures improves the strength and durability of recycled concrete. The use of recycled aggregate from construction and demolition wastes is showing prospective application in construction as alternative to natural aggregates. It conserves lot of natural resources and reduces the space required for the landfill disposal. In the present research work, the effect of recycled aggregate on strength and durability aspects of concrete is studied. Grade of concrete chosen for the present work is M50 (with a characteristic compressive strength of 50 MPa). The recycled aggregates were collected from demolished structure with 20 years of age. Natural Aggregate (NA) was replaced with Recycled Aggregate (RA) in different percentages such as 25, 50 and 100 to understand its effect. The experiments were conducted for different ages of concrete such as 7,14, 28,56 days to assess the compressive and tensile strength. Durability characteristics of recycled aggregate concrete were studied with Rapid chloride penetration test (as per ASTMC1202), sorptivity test and acid test to assess resistance against chloride ion penetration, capillary suction and chemical attack respectively. Mix design for 50 MPa gives around 35 MPa after replacing natural aggregate with recycled aggregate in concrete mix and the chloride penetration range also lies in moderate limit. Hence it is understood from the results that replacement of NA with RA is very much possible and will be ecofriendly. © 2013 Techno-Press, Ltd.},

abstract={The thoughtful complication in wireless communication arrangement consuming multi carrier inflection performance resembling OFDM is enormous Peak to Average Power Ratio. The competence of broadcast high power amplifier is diminished by this enormous Peak to Average Power Ratio. In this paper permutation of interleaving performance along with peak windowing performance has been projected. The permutation of this performance consequence in the reduction of Bit Error Rate thereby diminishing PAPR by 3.5dB. As a result out-of-band radiation gets enhanced within the existence of power amplifier which is not random in nature. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Nanostructured Zn doped Bi2O3 thin films was spray deposited on the glass substrate at the optimized temperature of 250°C. The structural studies confirm that the prepared film has β-phase tetragonal structure with polycrystalline nature. The grain size was calculated to be around 30 to 40 nm. The annealing effect improves the crystallinity and reduces the defect present in the film. The nanoflake like morphology was seen in the surface studies, upon annealing an even nanoflake was seen on the film. From the optical studies the band gap of the film is found to be 3.25 eV and on annealing the band gap decreases to 2.8 eV. The transmittance varies between 30 % - 35% for as deposited film and 20% - 28% for annealed film. The electrical studies confirm the semiconducting nature of the film. The resistance of the annealed film is more than the resistance of the as deposited film. The influence of Zn incorporation and annealing effect on the electronic properties of Bi2O3 is discussed and reported.},

abstract={[Cr(III)] is used in tannery processing and when left untreated, it is converted to its toxic form [Cr(VI)], due to oxidation. The toxic hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] is a known carcinogen and a mutagen. Extensive use of hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] in various industrial applications has caused substantial environmental contamination. The present work involves the evaluation of two bacterial strains, Ochrobactrum anthropi and Chromobacterium violacieum, for their hexavalent chromium reduction activity. Samples were collected from tanneries during the stages of animal hide processing, chrome tanning and final processing. Initial parameters like COD, BOD and pH were measured in the samples. In this study, strains were experimented on the final tannery effluent sample and on the nutrient broth amended with 50 and 36mg/l of chromium (VI) concentrations and their comparative efficiency for detoxification of chromium(VI) were analysed and compared. Aspergillus niger and other precipitating agents were experimented on chrome tanning effluent samples and their efficiencies for the removal of trivalent chromium were analysed and compared.},

This paper proposes the implementation of Wi-Fi based architecture for location estimation and navigation system, which is cost-effective by employing existing IEEE 802.11 network infrastructure available in many office and home environments. The proposed approach can provide meter level accuracy, which is sufficient for most location-aware applications. The positioning system is deployed to estimate the present location of the computing device such as a PDA by approximating the relation between improved Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) values and relative distance between the sender and receiver. It makes use of Modified Kalman Filtering which processes the available measurements, to estimate the current value of user's position. Using the location information obtained and the inputs from the user, positioning system navigates the user to desired destination. Thus the proposed system is able to position the user in a complex indoor environment with improved accuracy. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Context-aware computing is an emerging computing paradigm that can provide new or improved services, which are human centered and proactive in responding to the surrounding environment by exploiting user context information. In this paper an attempt is made to implement the TOA based indoor positioning scheme using Ultra Wide Band (UWB) radio. The TOA values are obtained based on symbol rate samples that are obtained from a square law device. These TOA values are then used for position estimation. Position estimation is done by two methods namely, Direct method and Objective method. It makes use of Kalman filter which processes the available measurements, to estimate the current value of user's position. The simulated results show that the Objective method gives the better performance when compared to Direct method. There are many applications that provide context-aware services based on the location of the user in emergency services which include gas explosions, aircraft crashes, earthquakes, train accidents and tsunami, where there is a major requirement to identify the presence of human beings within the disaster zones and also to provide accurate positioning and personal identification for possible presence of humans under debris. © 2013 IEEE.},

The results shows that the load carrying capacity is increased due to retrofitting and deflection, flexural stress and cracking were reduced.

abstract={Electric power system is undergoing changes as a result of constant increase in power demand and it leads to the system stretched beyond their stability and thermal limit. Transmission systems should be flexible to respond to changes in generation and load patterns. Alternatively, FACTS devices ensure effective utilization of existing transmission networks. In this proposed method, SVC devices is used to minimize the total active power loss in the transmission system, thereby increasing the power being transmitted. SVC devices can be inserted to the existing Transmission system itself. Hence it is a cost-effective solution to the minimization of power loss. Considering the high cost of SVC devices and its non-optimal placement may lead to increase in power loss, so it is important to decide their optimal location. In this proposed work, a sensitivity factor based method has been used to decide their optimal placement of SVC devices. The SVC device are implemented and tested in IEEE 14-bus system. Minimization of the transmission loss can be achieved by finding suitable reactive power compensation and optimal rating from SVC devices using Evolutionary Programming Technique. Power loss can be estimated before and after placing SVC device in the proposed IEEE 14 Bus system and results are compared. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Gyrases are DNA topology modifying enzymes, present only in prokaryotes which make them an attractive target for various antimicrobials. Quercetin, a major flavonoid, is known to inhibit supercoiling activity of DNA gyrase. Docking studies were performed to check the effect of quercetin against DNA gyrase of Mycobacterium smegmatis and Mycobacteirum tuberculosis. The results show that, quercetin effectively binds with the subunit B of DNA gyrase through interaction with residues that are in the Toprim domain of the protein. This domain is found to be very much essential for the cleavage and reunion of DNA. Using resazurin microtitre plate assay, the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of quercetin against both M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis was found to be 100μg/ml. The effect of quercetin against cytoplasmic membrane integrity of bacilli was assayed by potassium ion loss both in M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis. The results imply that there is no cytoplasmic membrane damage caused by quercetin. Therefore, we report that DNA gyrase might be a probable target for the quercetin in mycobacterium. © 2013 University of Bucharest.},

abstract={Apoptosis is a major cell death mechanism in multi-cellular organisms. Bcl-B (also known as Bcl2-L-10) is an anti-apoptotic protein and protects cells from apoptosis upon sequestering proapoptotic Bax protein. BIM, the BH3-only protein, binds on the BH3-binding groove of the protein and promotes Bax-mediated apoptosis. In this context, we retrieved 14 BH3-mimetics reported to the Bcl-B to date and the compounds were used for designing novel inhibitor to the protein using fragment-based drug designing (FBDD) method. The 14 BH3-mimetics showed 12 unique scaffolds and 51 nonredundant fragments. The 14 parent compounds, the 12 scaffolds and 51 fragments were docked on the BH3-binding groove of the protein and comprehensive analysis of the docking data resulted in a scaffold (1-phenyl-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione) and a set of fragments, which were effectively used to design tens of novel small molecular compounds by means of CombiGlide. High-throughput virtual screening of the novel compounds on the binding groove of the protein brought into fore a de novo antagonist, (5- amino-2-(ethylamino)-N-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-3-(1-phenyl-2,5-dioxo-2,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-3- yl)benzenesulfonamide), which showed binding affinities on the Bcl-B about two folds greater than the binding affinities of the 14 parent compounds reported in the literature. © 2013 University of Bucharest.},

abstract={Plants have always been a supreme source of drugs and India is endowed with a wide variety of them with high medicinal values. The Quorum Sensing (QS) quenching efficiency of various solvent extracts of Melia dubia seeds was investigated against uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) to screen the competitive inhibitor of SdiA, a transcriptional activator of quorum sensing in E. coli. In this study, potentiality of five different extracts of Melia dubia seeds for quorum sensing inhibitory activity was investigated against uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). Assays such as cell density, swarming motility, protein, protease, hemolysis, hemagglutination, hydrophobicity and biofilm inhibition were performed. Biofilm, hemolysis and swarming motility were found to be inhibited by 92.1%, 20.9 % and 48.52% respectively, when the medium was supplemented with 30 mg/ml of the ethanolic extract. GC-MS spectrum of the ethanolic extract showed an array of 27 structurally unlinked compounds with natural ligand C8HSL. The docking against QS transcriptional regulator SdiA was predicted by in silico studies and the ligand C6 showed significant activity with -10.8 GScore. In vitro and in silico docking analysis showed fairly a good correlation, suggesting that the ethanolic extract showed potency to attenuate quorum sensing of uropathogenic E. coli. Further studies by in vitro and in vivo strategies are necessary to foresee the quorum quenching effect of the ligands. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={Component Based Software (CBS) development is the assembling of already developed components and preparing for integration. For the last two decades, researchers have been concentrating much on CBS both in industry and academia, because CBS helps in the reduction of manpower, cost, software development time and better system maintainability. The selection of the best component from the large collection of components is a difficult task and only few researchers have addressed this issue so far by using optimization techniques. In this paper, we propose a new methodology to group the components effectively, based on the software architecture, by using fuzzy concepts. Again, Fuzzy Clustering Technique (FCT) is introduced to find the optimal grouping between the reusable components and the software architectures. The proposed model has the following advantages: (i) the proposed Fuzzy Weighted Relational Coefficient (FWRC) is used to measure the fuzzy relational value of the suggested 9 component parameters; (ii) A mathematical model is established to remove all less utility leveled components before grouping; (iii) FCT performs on newly developed similarity coefficient formula; (iv) Zero - One programming (optimization) technique is used to optimize the group; (v) Fuzzy Weighted Approach is used to find the dominant component among the component grouping, and (vi) Optimal grouping is achieved by the property, namely, maximizing the cohesion and minimizing the coupling when compared to other methods. Finally, the validation of the derived methodology is verified with sample Business Enterprise Applications. © 2013 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={Synthetic dyes are widely used in textile, food, paper and cosmetic industries. The effluents of these industries are highly coloured and the disposal of these wastes into receiving waters causes damage to the environment and can possess toxicity to human and aquatic life. The adsorptive removal of Direct Red 28 (DR) from aqueous solution by Pseudomonas putida MTCC 4910 was investigated. The effect of pH (4-9) and NaCl concentrations (1. mM-1. M) on the adsorptive removal of DR was investigated. There was no change in the adsorption of DR on bacterial cells observed at different pH and NaCl concentrations. The effects of initial dye concentration, initial inoculums size, contact time and temperature on the sorption of DR on cell surface were investigated. The interactions were assayed with respect to pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, Elovich and intra-particle diffusion kinetic models by linear regression methods, and were found to follow closely the pseudo-second-order. Equilibrium data also were fitted by linear regression methods through Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin and Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherm models. The equilibrium process was fitted well to Freundlich model, which indicates the multilayer adsorption of DR on bacterial cell surface. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Time of flight diffraction (TOFD) technique is a well-developed ultrasonic non-destructive testing (NDT) method and has been applied successfully for accurate sizing of defects in metallic materials. This technique was developed in early 1970s as a means for accurate sizing and positioning of cracks in nuclear components became very popular in the late 1990s and is today being widely used in various industries for weld inspection. One of the main advantages of TOFD is that, apart from fast technique, it provides higher probability of detection for linear defects. Since TOFD is based on diffraction of sound waves from the extremities of the defect compared to reflection from planar faces as in pulse echo and phased array, the resultant signal would be quite weak and signal to noise ratio (SNR) low. In many cases the defect signal is submerged in this noise making it difficult for detection, positioning and sizing. Several signal processing methods such as digital filtering, Split Spectrum Processing (SSP), Hilbert Transform and Correlation techniques have been developed in order to suppress unwanted noise and enhance the quality of the defect signal which can thus be used for characterization of defects and the material. Wavelet Transform based thresholding techniques have been applied largely for de-noising of ultrasonic signals. However in this paper, higher order wavelets are used for analyzing the de-noising performance for TOFD signals obtained from Austenitic Stainless Steel welds. It is observed that higher order wavelets give greater SNR improvement compared to the lower order wavelets. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The supercontinuum generation (SCG) in liquid core photonic crystal fiber (LCPCF) with versatile nonlinear response and the spectral broadening in dual core optical fiber is presented. The analysis is presented in two phase, phase I deals with the SCG in LCPCF with the effect of saturable nonlinearity and re-orientational nonlinearity. We identify and discuss the generic nature of the saturable nonlinearity and reorientational nonlinearity in the SCG, using suitable model. For the physical explanation, modulational instability and soliton fission techniques is implemented to investigate the impact of saturable nonlinear response and slow nonlinear response, respectively. It is observed that the saturable nonlinearity inevitably suppresses the MI and the subsequent SCG. On the other hand, the re-orientational nonlinearity contributes to the slow nonlinear response in addition to the conventional fast response due to the electronic contribution. The phase II features the exclusive investigation of the spectral broadening in the dual core optical fiber. © 2013 EDP Sciences and Springer.},

abstract={Analysis of audio and musical information signals deals with the decomposition into atoms. This subject is most interesting and useful for the researchers who want to invent the inherent properties of the signal under decomposition and to construct a new version of it. Many algorithms have been proposed for the decomposition of audio and musical content and methodologies have been demonstrated to visualizing the behavioral characteristics of such signals. This article outlines an overview of various decomposition algorithms such as high resolution matching pursuit, molecular matching pursuit, cyclic matching pursuit etc. and states the basis for that structural decomposition. Atomic decomposition of signal leads to represent the structure of audio or musical signal, allows to morph on sound into another by varying the parameter of an atom. This paper provides an overview of sound decomposition by Dictionary Based Methods (DBM). Audio signal can be decomposed into atoms by means of user-defined dictionary. This decomposition of signal using DBM can be achieved in different methods based on different parameters. DBM is useful to analyze the signal in multiple time scales such as music, environmental sound and biomedical signals. © IDOSI Publications, 2013.},

abstract={Management and disposal of municipal solid waste (MSW) is one of the major environmental problems in Indian cities. The current practices of the uncontrolled dumping of waste on the outskirts of towns/cities have created a serious environmental and public health problem. The annual rate of growth of urban population in India is 4% and rate of generation of solid waste increases exponentially with growth rate. Typical landfill of MSW may occupy an area of several acres. Unscientific dumping pollutes the environment to a greater extent and hence it is difficult to find the balance between economic growth and environmental protection. The dumping of municipal solid waste causes changes in the geotechnical properties of the soil and the quality of ground water. The focus of the present study is to carry out a comprehensive laboratory study on soil and water collected from in and around MSW dumping yard in Ariyamangalam, Tiruchirapalli and to investigate the changes in the index properties, compaction characteristics, hydraulic conductivity and shear strength properties of the soil .The results show that dumping has increased the the cohesion and compressibility of the soil, making it more plastic. Co-efficient of volume change, compression index and consolidation co-efficient show a similar trend. Diffusion of organic content into the soil causes the increase in its compressibility. The increase in compressibility is also evident from the increase in liquid limit. This can be attributed to reaction of leachate with the soil. The groundwater is also severely polluted in the vicinity of the dumping yard. This observation of change in geotechnical properties may be useful to carryout land development and water quality assessment activities in order to meet the land requirement in urban areas like Trichy and improving the quality of suburban environment in the vicinity of the dump yard sites. © 2013, EJGE.},

abstract={Objective: The present study was to evaluate the oral toxicity of acute, sub acute and histopathological studies of the active fraction of Stereospermum tetragonum DC using albino mice. Methods: In acute toxicity studies the active fraction of Stereospermum tetragonum DC was administered orally at doses ranging from 500-2000 mg/kg p.o the animals were observed for mortality and any toxic symptoms up to 14 days. In sub acute toxicity studies the active fraction was administered daily for 28 days with doses ranging from 100-400 mg/kg. The animals were observed for signs of toxicity, morbidity and mortality for 28 days. The animals were subjected to bio-chemical and hematological parameters on the 29th day and the animals were sacrificed for histopathological study. Results: The results of 14 days acute toxicity studies up to a dose of 2000mg/kg of the active fraction neither produced mortality nor show any symptoms of behavior or any physiological changes in body weight, food and water intake. The 28 days sub acute studies repeated doses of oral toxicity did not show any toxic signs or any mortality when three doses 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg of the active fraction administered. No significant changes were absorbed in Biochemical and hematological parameters when compared with the control group. The two higher doses slightly reduced serum glucose concentrations. The relative weights of animals were found to be comparable with control. The vital organs treated with the active fraction of the drug for 28 days did not show any gross abnormalities, histopathological changes or pathological lesions. Conclusion: From the results it is concluded that the dose at 400mg/kg is safe for long term treatment in diabetic conditions.},

It aims at increasing the processors performance by reducing its idle time. It is the ability of the processor to execute multiple threads simultaneously on different cores present inside. Multi-threading concepts have also been incorporated in embedded systems which employ either a single-core or multi-core architecture. The aim of this study is to evaluate how effectively multi-threading improves pro- cessor utilization on multiple cores by taking both single and dual core processors and evaluating the performance of each by comparing the number of instructions executed per second. The results of this study give an edge to multi- threading in a single-core processor when compared to a dual-core processor when performance aspects are consid- ered. Our analysis helps us to design the processor architec- ture in such a way that we utilize both the concepts of multi- threading and multi-core architecture to achieve maximum performance. The results of Simultaneous Multi-threading (SMT) performance improvement is encouraging when com- pared with dual-core processors. Copyright 2013 ACM.},

abstract={In this recent multimedia world, the significant challenges are the optimized use of storage space and Bandwidth. In order to reduce the storage space of images and transmission of information with limited Bandwidth availability, Image compression plays a imperative role by diminishing the size of image and to utilize the Bandwidth in economical and valuable manner without degrading the quality of image. In this paper we explore the performance analysis of different wavelet function for compression of images using wavelet thresholding. The wavelets used here are Biorthogonal 4.4, Haar, for decomposition of image. Hard and Soft thresholds are used for neglecting certain wavelet coefficients and the threshold methods used here are Global and Local thresholding. We analyzed the performance of this technique using metrics Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Mean Square Error (MSE) and Compression Ratio (CR). The obtained results shows that local thresholding provides better reconstruction of image than Global thresholding © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={In Wireless Sensor Networks, sensor nodes depends on battery power thus energy efficiency plays a major role as critical challenge in the lifetime improvement of networks. The lifetime of network is also based the key characteristics like number of nodes, mobility, coverage area and connectivity of nodes in the network. Recent research works says that the important of Wireless Sensor Network in various applications like sensing and monitoring based on dependency of applied applications which deals with lifespan of network. By using Backbone Scheduling technique in Wireless Sensor Networks, we can reduce and balance the consumption of energy to improve the lifetime of network. In this paper, we studied the performance of Virtual Scheduling Backbone (VSB) technique by combining Virtual Scheduling Graph (VSG) based algorithm with Local Replacement algorithm and the combined algorithm is named as Virtual Scheduling Backbone Replacement (VSBR) algorithm. Here replacement of node based on energy plays a major role for the improvement of life span of network. Thus the proposed algorithm is used to maintain long term processing and effective monitoring to overcome fault tolerance and to provide effective Quality of Service for sensing in the network. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={In food handling industry, grading of granular food materials is necessary because samples of material are subjected to adulteration. In the past, food products in the form of particles or granules were passed through sieves or other mechanical means for grading purposes. In this paper, analysis is performed on basmati rice granules; to evaluate the performance using image processing and Neural Network is implemented based on the features extracted from rice granules for classification grades of granules. Digital imaging is recognized as an efficient technique, to extract the features from rice granules in a non-contact manner. Images are acquired for rice using camera. Conversion to gray scale, Median smoothing, Adaptive thresholding, Canny edge detection, Sobel edge Detection, morphological operations, extraction of quantitative information are the checks that are performed on the acquired image using image processing technique through Open source Computer Vision (Open CV) which is a library of functions that aids image processing in real time. The morphological features acquired from the image are given to Neural Network. This work has been done to identify the relevant quality category for a given rice sample based on its parameters. The performance of image processing reduced the time of operation and improved the crop recognition greatly. Grading results obtained from Neural Network system shows greater accuracy when compared with the outputs from human experts. © 2013 IEEE.},

However, the increasing rate of data piracy accentuates the need for a secure wireless transmission. In this paper, we propose a technique to increase the efficiency of OFDM by incorporating embedding in it. The data is embedded in the system following the steps of modulation and cyclic prefix in the OFDM process. The BER graphs for various modulation schemes like BPSK, QPSK and QAM are analyzed to arrive at the best modulation scheme having higher error tolerance than others. © 2013 IEEE.},

In recent times, DWT (Discrete Wavelet Transform) & WT (Walsh Transform) are developed as a prevalent methods for compressing an image. In this, WT (Wavelet Transform) is one such significant transform of image compression. Outcome of this is altered with the wavelet type changes. In this paper, we used MSE & PSNR parameters to estimate the performance of several wavelets in image compression. The wavelet filters used in this process are Daubechies (db-x), Discrete meyer (dmey), Coiflets (coif-x), Biorthogonal (bior-x), Symlets (sym-x), Reverse Biorthogonal (rbio-x) along with 3 different color images. With this results, it is suggested that good choice of wavelet improves the quality as well as PSNR remarkably. MSE versus PSNR simulation results are tabulated with different wavelet filters. These results yielded 'dmey' wavelet filter produced better results. © 2013 IEEE.},

The indispensable facets of secure data transmission are none other than sheltered, hasty last but not least multifarious cryptosystem. The other dimension of information hiding is steganography. The downside of cryptography is though the secret is cloaked, communication is not rather disguised. For salvation steganography comes into play since the communication here is more obscured. Its prime façade lies in imperceptibility and the eminence of the resultant picture produced. If each of these can do wonders in information hiding separately, think of their blend! That too their unique and different perspective one cannot even think of! One such simple-to-implement yet complex-to-attack technique is what we present here. In this manuscript, without the need of cover the secret image itself undergoes manipulation using either of the two patterns defined and then is transmitted.

Analysis showed that better performance could be achieved with RS-CC combination than single codes. Furthermore the fast Fourier transform and the inverse fast Fourier transform blocks of the multiband OFDM system is exchanged with the discrete wavelet transform and inverse wavelet transform respectively. With the use of wavelet transform the interference due to symbol spread and the interference caused by the adjacent channel can be mitigated. It also eludes the use of cyclic prefix in the OFDM system. Finally the significance of interleaver in the system is also analysed.

abstract={The advent of the internet age has led to the increase of prominent network security issues. Information encryption has long been a method used for information security. With the rapid development of parallel computing capacities of computer hardware, this method alone could not be trusted to ensure security by increasing the key sizes, thus bringing in the information hiding techniques into the scenario. Cryptography scrambles the data to be secured while information hiding embeds the information into files which do not reveal the presence of information. Steganography and water marking are two information hiding techniques. While steganography is used for secretly embedding the sensitive information in files, watermarking is used to implement copyright protection. Steganographic techniques are being widely used these days to increase the security of information. A combination of cryptography and steganography results in very strong cryptosystems. This is a paper of unexampled prosperity, which elicits easy-to-implement, difficult-to-sense proficiency for image steganography enforcing the statistical distribution's profound laws. Bit length for embedding is adjudicated via some delineated conditions and is done so by making use of Least Significant Bit. These conditions are the index for increasing complexity as well as security. Experimental ensues in terms of BPP, embedding capacity, and stego outputs also vindicate this paper. This paper prognosticates the crucial imputes of steganography. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Electroactive polymers have applications in tissue engineering as a physical template for cell adhesion and carry electrical signals to improve tissue regeneration. Present study demonstrated the biocompatibility and biodegradability of poly(lactide-co-glycolide)-poly(3-hexylthiophene) (PLGA-PHT) blend electrospun scaffolds in a subcutaneous rat model. The biocompatibility of PLGA-undoped PHT, PLGA-doped PHT, and aligned PLGA-doped PHT nanofibers was evaluated and compared with random PLGA fibers. The animals were sacrificed at 2, 4, and 8 weeks; the surrounding tissue along with the implant was removed to evaluate biocompatibility and biodegradability by histologic analysis and GPC, respectively. Histology results demonstrated that all scaffolds except PLGA-undoped PHT showed decrease in inflammation over time. It was observed that the aligned PLGA-doped PHT fibers elicited moderate response at 2 weeks, which further reduced to a mild response over time with well-organized tissue structure and collagen deposition. The degradation of aligned nanofibers was found to be very slow when compared to random fibers. Further, there was no reduction in the molecular weight of undoped form of PHT throughout the study. These experiments revealed the biocompatibility and biodegradability of PLGA-PHT nanofibers that potentiate it to be used as a biomaterial for various applications. © 2013 Anuradha Subramanian et al.},

abstract={Affinity partitioning in aqueous two phase extraction is a single step purification process in downstream processing. Integrating metal ligands to the phase forming polymers in aqueous phase extraction known as ATPi ensures high selectivity and also promises good partition. In the present work, the effect of metal ligands in aqueous two phase extraction has been studied. This study has been validated in papain enzyme extraction from the fruit latex of papaya (Carica papaya) and compared with conventional aqueous two phase extraction (ATP). The metal integrated ATPi consisted of 20% w/v polyethylene glycol (PEG) and 15% w/v (NH4)2SO4 along with ligand composition of 0 to 2% w/v of metal ions (CoCl2, ZnSO4, CuSO4, CdCO3). This was compared with ATP extraction, which was composed of 20% w/v PEG and 15% w/v (NH4)2SO4 without ligands. Purification studies were carried out in anion exchange chromatography. Highly pure papain was obtained from fruit latex of papaya using ATPi extraction. The partition coefficient of papain in ATPi extraction was found to be 2.56 times higher than conventional ATP extraction.},

abstract={The use of recycled aggregate from construction and demolition wastes is showing prospective application in construction as an alternative to natural aggregates. It conserves natural resources and reduces the space required for landfill disposal. In this paper, strength characteristics of high-volume fly ash (FA)-based concrete with recycled aggregate of M50 grade were studied. The recycled aggregates were collected from a demolished structure 20 years of age. Natural aggregate (NA) was replaced with recycled aggregate (RA) in different percentages of 25, 50, and 100% to study the effect of recycled-aggregate concrete (RAC) on compressive and tensile strength characteristics. Similarly, the amount of cement was also replaced with fly ash in different percentages such as 40, 50, and 60% to study the effect of fly ash on compressive and tensile strength of concrete. The experiments were conducted for different ages of concrete such as 7, 14, 28, and 56 days. From the detailed investigations with 16 mix combinations, 50% replacement of cement with FA and 50% replacement of NAwith RA give satisfactory results by compromising strength 40 to 50% with a major reduction in cost. Depending on the field requirements, a construction engineer can go for designing M50-grade concrete where M30-grade concrete is to be deployed for structural purpose with the previously said combination. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract={In the ubiquitous computing world, data are accessed by everyone at any time anywhere. People want to perform their business and personal tasks on-line. A person always wants to be on communication for banking, shopping and learning. The attractive and faster access on line facilities have to concern the secrecy of the messages exchanged over the communication media. Besides the communicating parties, there is a chance for the intruder to access the secret data. Data should be secured such that no malicious user knows the presence of the secret data. Everybody in this universe needs a secret communication world. To satisfy the need of all the Internet users, information hihng technology has developed. The most powerful weapon to hide a secret message is steganography, which is older than cryptography. This study presents one more algorithm involving three easily implementable but complex procedures to increase the security during transmission of secret data. The routines are key value based k-bit embedding, embedding in line with Fibonacci series and by Shannon-Fano encoding, respectively. Each method follows an ideal procedure to encapsulate more secret information at the same time meeting other requirements for an idyllic transmission.

abstract={In this study, a secure mode of steganography is projected in which three main entities are exercised. They are Pseudo random generator, Least Significant Bit (LSB) substitution and Optimal Pixel Adjustment Process (OP AP). A popular cliche "All roads lead to Rome" says that there endure countless ways to attain a target. Likewise, this goes very well with Steganography than any other things. Digital epoch of steganography embraces numerous trials to surmount the universal hitch of concealment and refuge in every form of computer communication. This study reveals one more methodology for the same but with unique characteristics. Here, cyclic pixel indicator technique is used wherein two channels are used as data channels and the remaining channel is used as an indicator channel. Red plane is taken as the indicator channel for the first pixel for the subsequent pixels the indicator channels follows a periodic cycle of R, G, B. barring the indicator channel, the other two channels act as the data channels for the corresponding pixels. The pixel intensity determines the bits to be embedded. i.e., LSB's of the indicator channel. If the LSB's of indicator channel say R channel are 00 Embed 1 bitinG and 2 bits in B; in case of 01, embed 2 bits in G and B each. If LSB(R) is 10, 2 are inlayed in G and 3 bits in B. Finally id LSB(R) equals 11 and then 3 bits are ingrained in G and 3 bits in B. A novel 2-key based pseudo random generator is employed which is used to embed data completely in a unique random fashion based on user's choice. Thus, it introduces obscurity, while composite embedding of secret bits will result in additional intricacy. Therefore, this study is yet another practical cum unassailable means forsecret sharing. Justification for this study is provided by the analytical results. © 2013 Academic Journals Inc.},

abstract={In this pervasive world, we can access anything from anywhere. To have a secret communication, we need a technology such that no one is able to read or modify the secret message. The message should be sent without any intrusion by eavesdroppers. The secret message could be encrypted using cryptography and communicated. But a third party might suspect the presence of the secret message in this case. So, in order to hide the presence of the secret message, steganography is employed. Human eyes are imperceptible to the LSB changes in images and thus messages could be hidden in them. Image steganography will be powerful if there is not a proper sequence in the changes done to the pixels. In this proposed methodology, the secret logo is embedded in an image resulting in the stego-image 1. This is embedded in one more image resulting in stego image 2 which is again embedded in one more image to achieve 3rd level security. To get the secret logo we need to do the same process in the reverse manner. MSE and PSNR are calculated for the proposed method all levels. © 2013 Academic Journals Inc.},

Our paper provides the security for the data's in the database through the QR codes. This technology is mainly used for applications like security protection for military details, student information and also in mehcal fields, etc. The main objective of this is overlaying of the virtual object into the real world with the help of system and web camera, which gives sensitive vision to the researcher and which makes the object as a 3D projection in a real time processing technology. By using this technology it is used for security applications like Biometrics, QR codes also. It is used for high security applications like student document verification, military database, etc. Some profits in this can also be improved by QR codes as they are used in tracking and enemies prevention security systems also. Since, it is an emerging and well growing technology, AR applications requires some special devices. Because of the special devices it is very expensive generally.

abstract={There is more to an image than what just meets the naked eye. Images are no longer just memories or records of the past. Image steganography has made sure of this. With the growing need to secure our valuable information and data, the concept of information hihng was born. And from the day of its invention, it has evolved significantly. It has evolved from cryptography to watermarking for the copyright protection to Steganography. This study describes how the covert communication takes place effectively by means of Pixel Indicator (PI) and Pixel Value Differencing (PVD) for multi-user. The former is employed in the color cover image to separate it into three planes and any one plane indicating the data channel through its last two bits of its intensity values to entrench and the later introduces the variable bit embedhng in cover image. To increase the complexity, scrambling of secret data is introduced before embedhng itself. Steganalysis results proved that this method is more resistive to chi-square attack. The proposed methods performance is appraised by manipulating MSE and PSNR and the results are tabulated. © 2013 Academic Journals Inc.},

abstract={This study projects a unique means of steganography incorporating two diverse plots for images viz., compression and encryption. Being inhspensable for the sake of e-world, where images are numerously involved information security has caught attention of many. In this heterogeneous distributed computing world data are transferred accurately and faster. Many transmission mehums are available to send the data through internet. The main concern of the data transfer is to secure the data without any unauthorized access. To have a secured data transfer steganography and cryptography methods are involved. Cryptography scrambles the data whereas steganography conceals the data transfer. In this proposed method secret text is compressed using Shannon fano method and then encrypted using rail fence cipher followed by ceaser cipher to improve the security. Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) are calculated and analysis is done, K-bit embedhng is employed in this study to put the secret out of sight. This study pledges security, embedding capability and imperceptibility possessing high hardiness to security threats. © 2013 Academic Journals Inc.},

Even though, this Anglo Saxon work ethic is directed towards the must attitude for workmanship, the importance of this proverb for information security is phenomenal. Secure information sharing needs novel ideas and techniques to impede the incoming threats of secret drop outs. Steganography, an information hiding approach has seen a variety of flavours in terms of domains, algorithms, platforms etc. We present an information hiding approach on hardware platform where Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) works out a spatial domain steganographic module with fixed k-bit embedding and adaptive picture element position ? where -1<P<4 and gray scale change factor C falling between 0<C<3. This stego algorithm on programmable logic hides the secret message bits in the cover image stored in External SRAM through a convolution encoder which employs a triple XOR logic for encoded message creation to enhance the imperceptibility with higher embedding capacity. © 2013 Academic Journals Inc.},

abstract={High data rate and vulnerable are major challenges faced by present wireless communication systems since the demand for the internet and multimedia services are rapidly increasing and also the multimedia information are more secured in wired environment than in wireless environment. Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) has been considered as a hopeful technique for to achieve high data rate transmission, it also has many advantages like spectral efficiency, robust to multipath fading effect, easy hardware implementation etc. Though OFDM has many advantages, it is highly sensitive to synchronization error. Since the error rate is increased and the system performance is degraded due to synchronization error, it seems to be a major problem in OFDM. An Inter-Symbol Pilot Aided Algorithm is used to overcome this problem which estimate and compensate the synchronization error. In this study, the data is secured using Hash Encryption Algorithm which introduces authentication and encryption in OFDM system, without impairing its spectral efficiency. In this study, an OFDM system is designed with improved security and synchronization which increases the overall efficiency of the system. © 2013 Academic Journals Inc.},

Accordingly, communication and depot of facts, that too of confidence, has turned out to be an eminent antecedence. Thus the greater the furtherance, the greater is the need of defense. It is so because one can notice that every avant-garde h p t a l felony has something to do with the security. Also technolopcal progression has made a lot easier in communicating data however is assailable to snap and snatch by gatecrashers. Of all the other criteria, security tops the list for the reason that the information to be communicated may be of authoritative, high precision and insightful. To prevail over this issue come the solution in disguise, Cryptography and Steganography. Their ultimate endeavor is to have secure communication in its own right. While the former deals with text mostly, the other one deals with diptal files in this modern epoch. Their intermingling is now a widely practiced platform of secret sharing. Like the rest, Image Steganography too has some basic jargons. The main of such is Cover image that is the image chosen to hide the surreptitious information. Faultless steganographic schemes lie upon the choice of buildmg block and for sure cover images. This article takes this outlook and suggests a new way of cover generation.

abstract={To ensure secrecy in communication, especially if it is through image or any other digital file, attention should be paid on the tool concerned in transferring the file. It may entail intricate algorithms and cryptic measures. But the query here is how far it is multifarious? How thorny is it for the impostor to haul out the masked data? If these questions are genuinely answered by one, without doubt the algorithm is a rock. Here presented one such scheme which, of course, answers the above, ensures defence at three levels namely cryptography, steganography and fingerprinting. The first one involves encryption of text, steganography deals with burying the stealthy information, finally, fingerprinting, in general, toting up fingerprints to an entity or recognizing those which are previously inherent to a item. The efficacy is tested by the delineated image aspects. Additionally, this method can be put into action easily and bulky size of secret data can be passed on. © 2013 Academic Journals Inc.},

abstract={Artemisinin is a drug, widely used in malaria treatment. As the binding affinity of artemisinin and its derivatives dihydroartemisinin and artesunate to blood serum proteins might influence the effectiveness of the drug, binding of artemisinin and derivatives to serum albumin was studied under near physiological conditions. Binding kinetics indicate a simple, single-step association process for all artemisinin derivatives. The determined changes in enthalpy and entropy upon drug binding clearly indicate that hydrophobic forces are most important for artemisinin and dihydroartemisinin binding, whereas binding of artesunate is governed by both hydrophilic and hydrophobic forces. Key residues, which are most likely involved in binding of the respective compounds, were identified in subsequent protein/drug docking studies. The obtained results not only explain differences in between artemisinin and derivatives but generally illustrate how slight modifications in a drug can significantly affect principles underlying drug binding to target proteins. © 2013 Elsevier GmbH.

abstract={The new copper dimer [LCu(DMF)]<inf>2</inf>(NO<inf>3</inf>) <inf>4</inf>(H<inf>2</inf>O)(DMF)<inf>2</inf> (4), where L = [{1,1′-(CH<inf>2</inf>)<inf>2</inf>-C<inf>14</inf>H<inf>8</inf>)-3, 3′-(CH<inf>2</inf>CO<inf>2</inf>)<inf>2</inf>}{(HCN)<inf>2</inf>CH}], and porous coordination polymers [{L<inf>2</inf>Cu(OH<inf>2</inf>)<inf>2</inf>} <inf>2</inf>Br<inf>2</inf>]<inf>x</inf> (5) and [{L<inf>2</inf>Zn(OH <inf>2</inf>)<inf>2</inf>}<inf>2</inf>Br<inf>2</inf>]<inf>x</inf> (6) have been isolated from reactions of luminescent imidazolium carboxylate ligand, LH <inf>2</inf>Br<inf>2</inf> (3) and the corresponding metal precursors. The reaction between Cu(NO<inf>3</inf>)<inf>2</inf>·3H<inf>2</inf>O and LH<inf>2</inf>Br<inf>2</inf> (3) in DMF at 100 °C yielded bluish green crystals of tetracationic discrete copper dimer 4, the structure of which contains a rare tetracationic [(DMF)Cu(ii)]<inf>2</inf> dimer unit that is bridged by four carboxylates of two L in a "paddle-wheel" structure. When the reaction was carried out in the presence of a water-ethanol-methanol mixture, light green crystals of 5 were obtained. Molecule 5 comprises two-dimensional (2D) porous coordination polymeric sheets consisting of unique symmetrical dinuclear [(C(O)O)Cu(OH<inf>2</inf>)<inf>2</inf>(O(O)C) <inf>2</inf>]<inf>2</inf> building blocks, which are connected by imidazolium anthracene spacers. The infinite 2D porous coordination polymeric sheets are further linked by significant intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions by bromide anions to form a three-dimensional supramolecular framework. Interestingly, the reaction between zinc dust and LH<inf>2</inf>Br<inf>2</inf> (3) in H<inf>2</inf>O at room temperature gave similar structural features to those in 5, though they differ in terms of C-O bond distances and M-O-C angles. The solution-state UV-visible absorption spectra of 2-6 in water exhibits the comparable absorption pattern with decrease in the intensity of absorption from 5, 4, 3, 6 and 2, while the solid-state UV-visible absorption spectra of 2-6 are significantly different from the solution-state UV-visible absorption spectra. The considerable change in the fluorescent emission was observed upon complexation of 3 with corresponding metal precursors and the fluorescent emission was shifted towards the red region in the order of 2, 3, 6, 4 and 5 in water. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013.},

In the second stage this sanitized data is normalized using a min-max normalization approach before publishing. For verifying the experimental results we have used k-means clustering algorithm and it is evident from our results that this hybrid approach preserves privacy and also ensures accuracy. ©IDOSI Publications, 2013.},

Starting from 'offering good solution to differential equations' to capturing the nonlinearity in the data distribution, wavelets are used as appropriate tools that provide good mathematical model for scientific phenomena, which are usually modeled through linear or nonlinear differential equations. Review shows that the Haar wavelet method (HWM) is efficient and powerful in solving wide class of linear and nonlinear differential equations. The discrete wavelet transform has gained the reputation of being a very effective signal analysis tool for many practical applications. This review intends to provide the great utility of Haar wavelets to science and engineering problems which owes its origin to 1910.

Practically, compactness is achieved through data compression which reduces the storage space or the transmission capacity of the information. In this paper, the most reliable technique called arithmetic coding is used for compressing the information. Secure medium is achieved by concealing the compressed information into the image using Steganography.

So far in literature it is given many more ideas regarding the accretion of efficiency in MANET. Here we have revealed an easiest method to be adopted in present Adhoc network. This method is gives as SaP (Short alternate Path) protocol, a simplest method to improve the working of MANET. This protocol helps to catch the packets during the packet drop at link breaks or path failure. This protocol transfers the data from the failed node and delivers it to the node next of the failed node in the route through an alternate node. Thus this protocol doesn't go in search of alternate path or new route flooding the requests. This conserves the energy and makes the shortest path back to life even after the node failure at a point. This proposed idea increases the packet delivery ratio, no extra flooding of request, energy consumption and decreased time delay. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={In the present study, the syntheses of crystalline silver and gold nanoparticles (NPs) has been demonstrated in a green and environmentally friendly approach using citrus fruit extracts (lemon, Citrus limon (Cl-1) and sweet orange, Citrus limetta (Cl-2)). In addition, potentially hazardous metal ion sensing properties of these NPs in aqueous solution has been explored. Cl-1 and Cl-2 that predominantly contained citric and ascorbic acid, exhibited different reducing abilities towards silver and gold ions into NPs. Cl-1 reduces silver ions into AgNPs only in the presence of sunlight whereas AuNPs from gold ions were formed without exposure to sunlight. In contrast, Cl-2 converts both silver and gold ions into the corresponding NPs in the absence of sunlight. The colorimetric sensor studies of these green synthesized AgNPs (Cl-1-AgNPs) showed selective sensing of the potentially hazardous Hg2+ ion in water at micromolar concentrations. More importantly, green synthesized Cl-1-AgNPs sensor systems detected Hg2+ ions in water in a wide pH range (3.2 to 8.5). © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={Carbon synthesized from plant leaf powder was employed for the adsorption of methylene blue from aqueous effluent. Effects of pH (2, 4, 6, 8, and 9), dye concentration (50, 100, 150, and 200 mg/dm3), adsorbent dosage (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 g/dm3), and temperature (303, 313, and 323 K) were studied. The process followed pseudo-second-order kinetics. Equilibrium data was examined with Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models and Langmuir model was found to be the best fitting model with high R 2 and low chi 2 values. Langmuir monolayer adsorption capacity of the adsorbent was found to be 61.22 mg/g. From the thermodynamic analysis, ΔH, ΔG, and ΔS values for the adsorption of MB onto the plant leaf carbon were found out. From the values of free energy change, the process was found out to be feasible process. From the magnitude of ΔH, the process was found to be endothermic physisorption. © 2013 V. Gunasekar and V.

abstract={Nowadays, the power transmission network is expanding and is getting more complicated day by day. The problems of uncontrolled loop flows, overloading, excess of short circuit current levels and system instabilities are causes of concern for a power engineer. These serious problems have necessitated new transmission technologies to be adopted such as FACTS (Flexible AC Transmission System) devices which make electrical energy transmission more efficient and reliable. Among the FACTS controllers the TCSC (Thyristor Controlled Series Compensators) plays a major role. TCSC is mainly used to enhance line loadability and damp inter-area oscillations for smooth synchronous operation of the interconnected regions. Thus TCSC is used to enhance the effective performance of the system. The main objective of this paper is to examine the improvement of power system stability by introducing TCSC in the power system model through the inspection of their waveforms, where the design and simulation is done by using PSCAD (Power System Computer Aided Design). © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Nanoemulsions (NEs), an isotropic mixture of oil and water stabilised by FDA approved surfactant and co-surfactant molecules have mean droplet size less than 25% of wavelength of visible light. They are homogenous, optically clear solution with high free energy, drug penetration, bio-availability, absorption rate, resistant to enzymatic degradation and hydrolysis can store both hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs depending on the type of NE formed which results in enhanced physicochemical properties and behavioural kinetics than micro/macro emulsions. They utilise only less amount of surfactant and reduce the dosage and frequency of drug. NEs can be prepared by both high energy and low energy emulsification method where former make use of devices to create dispersive forces while the latter makes use of change in parameters that affect the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) of the system. Their thermodynamic and physical stability, Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC), Interfacial tension, viscosity, Particle size, electrical conductivity, pH, Scanning Electron Microscopy and Transmission Electron Microscopy are analyzed to make desired NEs that suit a particular application. Nanoemulsion region is determined by construction of Ternary phase diagram. Use of co-surfactant follows Pseudo-Ternary Phase diagram. NEs are used in wide range of applications like antimicrobial, cosmetics, cancer therapy, anti-inflammation, oil recovery, skin permeation etc. Basic researches have to be done to lead to the next level in making many NE formulations to meet human needs of today's world in all possible ways.

abstract={Rice is the only cereal consumed as staple food mainly as whole grains by more than 50 percent people of the world. The overall cooking and eating quality of such a significant crop determines its widespread preference, acceptance and consumption. The varieties, hybrids, landraces of rice are immense in diversity not only in morphological traits but also in end-use qualities. Hence, the choice for palatability relies on many cooking and eating quality parameters such as grain shape, chalkiness, gelatinization temperature, gel consistency, amylose content etc., Based on the combinational composition of these parameters, all the known varieties of rice have been classified, identified and promoted. For such quality classification, soft computing technique-fuzzy logic has been employed supported with correlation studies as the criteria for determining the cooking and eating quality preference includes both discrete and non discrete parameters. The output results in sorting 11 varieties into 5 preferential groups based on combination of 6 palatability parameters.},

abstract={Round Robin (RR) is a pre-emptive algorithm used in multiprogrammed, conventional systems to schedule all the processes which are present in ready queue for execution. It has some advantages over other algorithms i.e., it gives a chance to all process to utilize processor for equal time interval. But this technique increases average turnaround time, average waiting time and if quantum value is very less, then CPU time is wasted in switching between processes and increases overheads. If it is high, the algorithm just works like FCFS and cannot be used in time sharing systems. The algorithm performance depends on quantum value. Turnaround time and waiting time are the criteria of the system which should be maintained as less as possible. Standard RR (SRR) algorithm does not posses logic in fixing quantum value. In our paper we propose Low-power Switching (LS) algorithm which reduces context switching and also reduces average waiting time and average turnaround time. So throughput of system will be raised. Experimental analysis shows the feasibility of the proposed algorithm which gives better turnaround time, waiting time and context switching compared with SRR technique and some related works.

abstract={The shaping of future generations depends on an education system that aims at a holistic development of a student. This paper proposes an education model which is a mixture of a traditional educational system and the latest technological advancements. The Gurukul way of learning was pioneered and practised by early Indians; we have discussed, in this paper, some illustrative examples of how the practise led shape to a more complete student. The current education system has a shift from quality education to education to the masses. The central figure of Guru, who would imbibe in his students both knowledge and character, is also lost. The Gurukul tradition provided a more personalized learning experience where the Guru would judge his pupil and understand his strengths and weaknesses. An idealsystem would be one that provides a personalized learning experience to everyone. Such a system in our modern times is only possible by using the technological advancements available, in particular the increased research and development of Cloud computing technology. The increased availability of educational resources, a student analysis mechanism and an educational system modelled on traditional methods would not only intellectually improve students but also make them aware of moral values. The general misconception that technology would replace the human teacher is vanquished in our discussion. This paper suggests an approach would ensure that the potential of each student is developed to the maximum level by using the new vistas opened up by modern technology.},

abstract={Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) a biodegradable polymer, was electrospun to obtain defect-free nanofibers. The structural similarity of PHBV nanofibers and the extracellular matrix in skin may present well for fibroblast cell adhesion and proliferation. The average fiber diameter of the electrospun fibers was 583±90 nm. The potential of PHBV scaffolds for human keratinocytes (HaCaT) adhesion, proliferation and gene expression were evaluated. Our results demonstrated that PHBV nanofibers favor HaCaT adhesion and proliferation. After 14 days of culture, loricrin and keratin-1 gene expression were significantly higher when compared to 3 and 7 days (p < 0.05). The expression of genes associated with T lymphocyte activation (HLA-DRB, thymosin beta 10 (h-Tim)) and IL-2 mediated lymphocyte activation genes (h-Tim, Tumour Rejection Antigen (TRA 1), nRap 2) were investigated in human lymphocyte cultured on PHBV nanofibers. T Lymphocyte activation and IL-2 mediated lymphocyte activation genes were down-regulated after 48 and 72 hours of culture. After 24, 48 and 72 hours of culture there was no inflammatory cytokines production by the cultured lymphocytes. Thus, our results confirm the biocompatibility of PHBV nanofibers and suggest that consideration can be given to the use of PHBV nanofibers for skin tissue engineering applications.

There were no significant changes (P < 0.05) in the body weights, organ weights and haemato-biochemical parameters in any of the dose levels. No treatment related gross/histopathological lesions were observed. The present investigation demonstrated that the no observed adverse effect level was 2000 mg/kg body weight per day of hydroalcoholic extract of W. somnifera in rats and hence may be considered as non-toxic.

In this study, we synthesized biodegradable aliphatic polyesters, namely poly(butylene pimelate) (PBPi), poly(butylene succinate) (PBSu), and poly(butylene sebacate) (PBSe), by the polycondensation of equimolar quantities of dicarboxylic acid and diol using mesoporous SBA-15 silica as heterogeneous catalyst. We then compared its performance with a conventional homogenous catalyst, SnCl2·2H2O, which did not form these polymers. The synthesized SBA-15 catalyst was characterized by electron microscopy, nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm and infrared spectroscopy. The synthesized polyesters were evaluated using infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, gel permeation chromatography, scanning electron microscopy and goniometry. The combined results demonstrate that the SBA-15 mesoporous catalyst formed higher molecular weight degradable polyesters in addition to higher yield and purity, thus confirming the superiority of the mesoporous silica catalyst for polymer formation. © 2013 The Polymer Society of Korea and Springer Sciene+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={The weld flaw detection using image processing techniques helps in avoiding huge disaster in industries such as petrochemical, power generation and nuclear power plant, since this automated defect detection is more reliable and faster than other techniques. This paper proposes a new advanced Fuzzy c-Means (FCM) clustering for the detection of weld defect in radiographic images which arise due to various reasons which affect adversely at the time of welding process. The welding defect such as Burnthrough, Lack of Penetration and Slag Inclusion can lead to disaster if undetected at the initial stage of installation of the machine or pipeline etc. Feature extraction is the process of detecting and isolating the distinguishable features for pattern identification which plays a major role in the success of pattern recognition. This paper adopted a new method of extracting feature vector by performing Radon transform for a single angle along the major orientation axis of the weld defect. This paper also proposes a new improved FCM clustering where the objective function is minimised in less number of iterations when compared with ordinary FCM and Hard c-Means. The implementation and result analysis of clustering shows that a better veracity is achieved in less number of iterations with the proposed advanced FCM with Radon transform based feature extraction when compared to Zernike moment based feature extraction.},

Landslide database was generated using IRS-1C satellite LISS III data and aerial photographs accompanied by field investigations using differential global positioning system to generate a landslide inventory map. Topographical, spatial, and field data were processed to construct the spatial thematic layers using image processing and GIS environment. Twelve landslide-inducing factors were used for landslide vulnerability analysis: elevation, slope, aspect, plan curvature, profile curvature, proximity to road, drainage and lineament, land use/land cover, geology, geomorphology, and run-off. The first five factors were derived from digital elevation model, and other thematic layers were prepared from spatial database. Frequency ratio of each factor was computed using the above thematic factors with past landslide locations. Landslide vulnerability map was produced using raster analysis. The landslide vulnerability map was classified into five zones: very low, low, moderate, high, and very high. The model is validated using the relative landslide density index (R-index method). The consistency of R-index indicates good performance of the vulnerability map. © 2012 Saudi Society for Geosciences.},

abstract={Recently we showed that the binding energy of the benzene⋯acetylene complex could be tuned up to 5 kcal/mol by substituting the hydrogen atoms of the benzene molecule with multiple electron-donating/electron-withdrawing groups (J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2012, 8, 1935). In continuation, we have here examined the influence of various substituents on the CH⋯π interaction present in the benzene⋯methane complex using the CCSD(T) method at the complete basis set limit. The influence of multiple fluoro substituents on the interaction strength of the benzene⋯methane complex was found to be insignificant, while the interaction strength linearly increases with successive addition of methyl groups. The influence of other substituents such as CN, NO2, COOH, Cl, and OH was found to be negligible. The NH2 group enhances the binding strength similarly to the methyl group. Energy decomposition analysis predicts the dispersion energy component to be on an average three times larger than the electrostatic energy component. Multidimensional correlation analysis shows that the exchange-repulsion and dispersion terms are correlated very well with the interaction distance (r) and with a combination of the interaction distance (r) and molar refractivity (MR), while the electrostatic component correlates well when the Hammett constant is used in combination with the interaction distance (r). Various recently developed DFT methods were used to assess their ability to predict the binding energy of various substituted benzene⋯methane complexes, and the M06-2X, B97-D, and B3LYP-D3 methods were found to be the best performers, giving a mean absolute deviation of ∼0.15 kcal/mol. © 2013 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={A barrier for horizontal gene transfer is high gene expression, which is metabolically expensive. Silencing of horizontally-acquired genes in the bacterium Escherichia coli is caused by the global transcriptional repressor H-NS. The activity of H-NS is enhanced or diminished by other proteins including its homologue StpA, and Hha and YdgT. The interconnections of H-NS with these regulators and their role in silencing gene expression in E. coli are not well understood on a genomic scale. In this study, we use transcriptome sequencing to show that there is a bi-layered gene silencing system-involving the homologous H-NS and StpA-operating on horizontally-acquired genes among others. We show that H-NS-repressed genes belong to two types, termed epistatic and unilateral. In the absence of H-NS, the expression of epistatically controlled genes is repressed by StpA, whereas that of unilaterally controlled genes is not. Epistatic genes show a higher tendency to be non-essential and recently acquired, when compared to unilateral genes. Epistatic genes reach much higher expression levels than unilateral genes in the absence of the silencing system. Finally, epistatic genes contain more high affinity H-NS binding motifs than unilateral genes. Therefore, both the DNA binding sites of H-NS as well as the function of StpA as a backup system might be selected for silencing highly transcribable genes. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={Specific release of drugs in the tumor microenvironment can significantly enhance the therapeutic efficiency. This work attempts to develop a mesoporous silica carrier that can selectively release drugs in the tumor microenvironment. Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MCM-41) with spherical morphology were synthesized using the sol-gel method. The MCM-41 nanoparticles were then functionalized with 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysiliane (MPTMS), an organic thiol linker, through evaporation-induced self-assembly. Both unmodified and thiol-functionalized nanoparticles were characterized using electron microscopy, spectroscopy, thermogravimetry and surface area analysis. The mesoporous architecture of MCM-41 was used to load 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). The thiol functionalization enabled easy oxidation of the sulphydryl groups and formed disulphide cross-links, which was found to retard the drug release when compared to unmodified MCM-41. Addition of the reduced form of glutathione to the thiol-functionalized system was found to enhance the drug release through lysis of the disulphide links by reduction. The correlation between the amount of drug released and the disulphide cross-links was established by addition of reduced glutathione at alternate time points where a step-wise release profile was observed, thereby establishing the chemosensitivity of the thiol-functionalized MCM-41. Cell culture studies revealed that the cancer cells were more susceptible to the thiol-functionalized 5-FU loaded MCM-41 when compared with normal cells. The mechanism involves both membrane perturbation as well as high intracellular glutathione levels. These results indicate that this chemoswitchable system might be effective against cancer cells as they contain large amounts of reduced glutathione, demonstrating the potential of this carrier as a next generation 'smart' delivery system. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={The spatial variability studies performed to see the varying effect of soil properties across the fields and to make efficient crop management decisions in the future. The goal of this study was to determine spatial variability of selected soil properties that influences crop growth and its crop yields. The study was conducted in an agricultural field Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India. The data collected were analyzed using geostatistics tool with semivariograms, kriging and classical statistics that involved mean, range, standard deviation and coefficient of variation. The statistical analysis showed a high variability for soil pH having a Cv of 11.88%. The parameters such as infiltration, porosity, Field Capacity (FC), Wilting Point (WP) and phosphorus showed considerable variability with a coefficient of variation between 5 and 9% and least variability was found to exist for electrical conductivity (EC), available potassium (K), available nitrogen (N) and Bulk Density (BD) with Cv of 0.037, 0.29, 0.62 and 2.01, respectively. The semivariograms were calculated for the study area with a sampling distance of 5 m and the N, P, K and EC were linear with sill models and each showed a considerable range of spatial dependence measuring a distance between 10 and 25 m. The kriged surface was created for all the soil properties with the exception of BD, porosity and WB as these parameters were found to be spatially uncorrelated. These spatial variations in soil properties in the field may arise from management activities or due to soil textural effects. © 2013 Knowledgia Review, Malaysia.},

abstract={In this work a low cost coagulation analyzer is developed using LPC 2138 Microcontroller to determine the values of PT (Prothrombin Time) and APTT (Activated partial Thomboplastin Time) in samples with Hyperbilirubinimea (High Bilirubin) ranging from 0-22.0 mg/dl. Most of the conventional Instruments are able to detect the clotting time only when the bilirubin level in the sample is within the range of 0-5.0 mg/dl. It is really a challenge to overcome the interference due to high bilirubin (yellow color) and determine the values of PT and APTT in ICTERIC (jaundice) or liver cirrhosis patients. In the developed instrument yellow light (LED 590 nm) having a minimum absorbance (Beer-Lambert's Law) while passing through the yellowish sample is used to detect the changes in light intensity while clotting of the sample occurs and thus eliminates the interference of higher bilirubin content (above 4 mg/dl) in blood samples. In the conventional instruments the light (Red -above 630 nm) is absorbed to the maximum and therefore it becomes difficult to detect minute changes in the outcoming light while clotting occurs, limiting its performance. It is observed that the designed Instrument shows the performance of measurement of PT and APTT in 95.5 % samples with hyperbilirubinemia against 31.8 % of samples in COAT-1 analyzer. © 2013 IFSA.},

The ornamental fishes such as Carassius auratus, Cyprinus carpia, Helostoma temminckii, Catla catla, and Pecilia sphenops, were selected to get the gut micro flora for scp. Fish feed was prepared with five different microbial cells with various origins. Furthermore, denitrogen fixing Azotobacter and antagonistic Streptomyces were selected from the medicinal plants on the rhizosphere samples. In order to understand the food conversion efficiency and food conversion ratio in the ornamental fish, Xyphophorus helleri fish feed were prepared with five different microbial cells and the control feed was without the microbial cells. The total protein concentration was estimated for all the feed systems by lowry's method The rate of feeding of six fishes in each trough varied on every day. The highest rate of feeding was noticed in feed 4 and minimum in feed 2 among the microbial feeds. Feed conversion ratio and conversion efficiency revealed wider variations. The microorganism is also called as bio proteins and they could synthesize growth honnrones and vitamins. From the present observations this may be the reason for better growth rate in fish feed on single cell protein diet and have the protective mechanisms against pathogenic infections. lt is a promising area of research on Microbial Biotechnology and Aquaculture.},

abstract={Objective: Serratiopeptidase (SRP) is a proteolylic enzyme with wide medical applications. Serratia marcescens strain was UV mutated and maximum SRP producing UV mutant SM3 was selected by its caseinolytic property. Methods: Batch production studies were carried out by varying carbon and nitrogen sources. The carbon sources used were maltose, starch, glucose and lactose. The nitrogen sources used were soya bean meal, tryptone, peptone and yeast extract. The initial pH of the medium containing maltose and tryptone was varied from 4 to 9. Purification of SRP was done by ammonium sulphate precipitation with various saturation conditions from 30% to 80%. Results: The production medium containing tryptone, with maltose as carbon source gave 36,415EU/mg at 68th hr. The production medium containing maltose as carbon source gave 32,575EU/mg at 68th hr. which is far greater than the maximum yield already reported The media with initial pH 7 gave an SRP production of 37,060EU/mg. At 40% saturation, the specific enzyme activity of the pellet obtained was found to be 63,623EU/mg. The dialysed sample gave specific enzyme activity of 1,90,451EU/mg. The characterization of the enzyme was done by SDS PAGE. Conclusion: From the results it is concluded that the production of serratiopeptidase enzyme is maximum from the UV mutated strain of Serratia marcescens.},

abstract={Data communication through wireless channels faces a challenging issue towards congestion and link quality variation. Regardless of stationary or mobile nodes in the network, the link between the nodes experiences a fluctuation in link quality. Congestion is an intriguing issue which occurs when there is a detoriation in QoS at the link which carries the data. The consequences of these problems are overcome by cooperative communication which has revealed a new path in research by uniting the nature of broadcasting in autonomous network and the link quality fluctuation. Our solution in tackling this problem is put forward as CARMAN (Congestion Avoidance through Cooperative Routing in MANets). This CARMAN is triggered by setting a threshold value for 'Number of hops' and the 'Number of packets'. There exists a methodology proposed as Cooperative Opportunistic Routing in Mobile Ad hoc Networks (CORMAN) which has an issue regarding congestionand also a problem towards multi packet transmission. These problems can be overcome by our proposed scheme. This scheme (CARMAN) has been simulated for results in Network Simulator-2 (ns2) to compare the performance with CORMAN and AODV respectively. The simulated results show a drastic increase in packet delivery ratio and reduction in packet drop compared to CORMAN & AODV, thus proving the efficiency of the proposed scheme. This CARMAN helps in congestion and traffic control along the path. Also the overall time delay of the network is managed. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={The promise of the cloud is appealing: reduced costs, greater agility, flexibility, scalability and potentially greater security. At the same time, IT organizations recognize that the cloud introduces a number of issues related to security, data integrity, compliance, service level agreements and data architecture that must be addressed. Therefore, the adoption of cloud services is being tempered by a significant level of uncertainty. Numerous surveys indicate that the top concerns for moving to the cloud are security, performance and availability. In other words, enterprises are looking for assurances that they are not adding risk to the business by leveraging the cloud. For many, moving to the cloud is still a leap of faith. Different cloud deployment models-public, private, or hybrid have different security vulnerabilities and risks. Generally, risk increases from greater degrees of multitenancy among increasingly unknown participants. The objective of this article is to insist the fact that cloud security begins with and adds to, well-defined enterprise security; it also introduces a new cloud security model called Cloud Security NXT. © Maxwell Scientific Organization, 2013.},

abstract={Due to the explosive growth of web technology, a huge amount of information is available as web resources over the Internet. Therefore, in order to access the relevant content from the web resources effectively, considerable attention is paid on the semantic web for efficient knowledge sharing and interoperability. Topic ontology is a hierarchy of a set of topics that are interconnected using semantic relations, which is being increasingly used in the web mining techniques. Reviews of the past research reveal that semiautomatic ontology is not capable of handling high usage. This shortcoming prompted the authors to develop an automatic topic ontology construction process. However, in the past many attempts have been made by other researchers to utilize the automatic construction of ontology, which turned out to be challenging due to time, cost and maintenance. In this paper, the authors have proposed a corpus based novel approach to enrich the set of categories in the ODP by automatically identifying the concepts and their associated semantic relationship with corpus based external knowledge resources, such as Wikipedia and WordNet. This topic ontology construction approach relies on concept acquisition and semantic relation extraction. A Jena API framework has been developed to organize the set of extracted semantic concepts, while Protégé provides the platform to visualize the automatically constructed topic ontology. To evaluate the performance, web documents were classified using SVM classifier based on ODP and topic ontology. The topic ontology based classification produced better accuracy than ODP.

abstract={The present work aims at the formulation of novel anti-human immunodeficiency virus vaginal compactable inserts to enhance the pharmacological effects of zidovudine (AZT). Attempt was taken to design a dosage form, which provides sustained release of the drug at the site of action so as to minimize the overall dose and dosing frequency that can reduce the risk of side-effects. Different formulations of the vaginal compacts of AZT were prepared employing wet granulation method, utilizing several mucoadhesive polymers such as hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC 5, 15, 50, 3000 cps) and methyl cellulose (MC) at 20%, 30% and 40% concentrations. The formulations were evaluated and post-compression parameters including drug content, swelling study, in vitro diffusion, dissolution and drug release kinetic studies. Instrumental analysis like differential scanning calorimetry as well as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy were performed to find the change in thermal properties and the possible interactions between drug-polymer, respectively. X-ray diffraction study was also done to reveal the modification of crystalline nature of drug in the formulation. The compacts prepared by HPMC 50 cps (40%) exhibited the better results in terms of swelling with sustained drug release through the gelled layer. Regardless of good physicochemical parameters, MC did not display a good polymer of choice due to accumulation of spongy gelled blanket around the compact, which is not homogenous but stiff and brittle.},

Glucose obtained by the acid pre-treatment of cassava bagasse was used as the substrate for the production xanthan gum. The production rate of xanthan gum was improved by the addition of citric acid. The analytical studies had shown a gradual increase in xanthan gum production when citric acid was added in fed batch mode to the fermentation media. Higher citric acid concentration was inhibitory to xanthan gum synthesis. The polymer obtained was then analyzed using FTIR spectrum for the identification of functional groups.},

abstract={Nanostructured thin films of Bismuth oxide (Bi2O3) was spray deposited on the glass substrate at an optimum temperature of 230°C. The structural properties confirm that the prepared thin films were polycrystalline in nature with β-phase tetragonal structure. The grain size was calculated to be around 10 nm. The crystallinity is improved after annealing. The morphological studies confirm the nanostructured thin film with nano flake like structure. From the optical studies the band gap is found to be 3.1 eV for as deposited Bi2O3 thin film, whereas 3.2 eV for annealed Bi2O3 film. The transmittance of as deposited film is 30% whereas for annealed film there was a decrease in the transmittance in the visible region. The electrical characteristics confirm that the prepared thin films were having semiconducting nature. The resistance - temperature characteristics of as deposited and annealed Bi2O3 were studied and reported. From the reported work by fine tuning the preparatory conditions, nanostructured Bi2O3 thin films can be synthesized which will well suit for engineering applications.},

abstract={This paper presents the microcontroller based measurement and analysis of kinematic viscosity of vegetable oils that reduces human effort and increases the accuracy of measurement. The developed system consists of AT mega 328 microcontroller, ultrasonic range detecting sensor, temperature sensor, heater, solid heater controller, keyboard and LCD to display the results. The instrument will keep the oil at any desired temperature and measure the time of 50cc of the sample collection so as to compute viscosity of the sample. Viscosities of rice bran oil and corn oil at temperatures ranging from 303-363K are calculated from the measurement of time taken to collect 50cc. Observations reveal that there is a decrease in viscosity with increase in temperature due to decrease in intermolecular forces. The experimental results obtained are compared with a standard instrument and the correlation coefficient is found to be accurate (R2 = 0.998). The measured viscosity and its corresponding temperature are found to fit into the Arrhenius equation, Reynolds equation, Walther equation and Power law model using regression analysis.},

In this work, highly ordered mesoporous silica was synthesized from sugarcane leaf ash by a template-assisted method. It was successfully used as an adsorbent for the recovery of bromelain from pineapple fruit pulp. Amine-functionalized mesoporous silica exhibited a recovery efficiency of 97.89% and a 6.2-fold purification. It was also established that the adsorbent could be easily regenerated by adjusting the pH. In this study, the adsorbent was reused for three cycles without noticeable loss in recovery efficiency. Thus, adsroption using functionalized SBA-15 appears to be a promising alternate separation technique for the recovery of fruit bromelain.},

The influence of temperature depends on MWCNT concentration also. At lower concentrations of MWCNT and at temperatures greater than 40 °C, the thermal conductivity increase is greater than the viscosity increase, suggesting its possible use for cooling applications.

abstract={Proteins are large biomolecules comprising of α - L amino acids connected by peptide bonds. They fold into a three dimensional structure to become functionally significant. Most of the information related to protein folding is embedded within the primary peptide sequence itself. With the advent of structural genomics, prediction of biological function from protein structure has become one of the major goals of structural biology. The structure data comes in the form of a PDB file, listing the three-dimensional (3D) coordinates of atoms in the protein. The "site" record which is present sometimes in the PDB file can be used for marking the ligand-binding sites, metal-binding sites or active sites. Analysis of the PDB files suggests that a limited number of protein folds/families occur in nature. This limitation is probably due to physicochemical constraints on protein folding that favour particular packing arrangements. There are many methods from which protein function can be inferred with respect to its structure. Important among these techniques is identification based on homologous sequences. Homologous proteins within species are similar in sequence and are likely, but not guaranteed, to have a similar function. Comparison of an un-annotated sequence to known homologous sequences is therefore a good starting point for predicting function. Centered on this concept, we have developed an online server PDBMut, for comparing protein structures with respect to their primary sequence. The tool is unique to itself as it identifies similar protein structures as well as structures of proteins with one or more differing amino acids.},

abstract={The accretion of data from various handwritten manuscripts, printed texts, holy Vedas, sacred books, relevant and significant literature have been coherently analyzed to give a trajectory overview on the ample ancient varietal choices of the significant cereal, rice, in the day to day life of people of yesteryears. This article gives a trailing account on the antiquity of rice in the context of diversity of its ancient varieties, their medicinal and secular usage by the ancient people, both in North and South India. The Samaveda, Atharvaveda, and Yajurveda refer to Krisanam Vrthina (black rice), Asunam Vrihina (swift growing rice), Naivaram (wild rice), Mahavrithinam (large rice), and Sukla Vrihi (white rice) as different traditional varieties of cultivated rice highlighting their diversity in size and color. Hill paddy and deep water rice landraces are mentioned in Jatakas. Yajurveda and Atharvaveda outline the various forms of rice offerings to different gods and goddesses including Sun God, Annalakshmi, and Dhanyalakshmi in India. Pathartha Kunapadam claims the therapeutic potential of South Indian rice landraces which needs to be clinically validated. Moreover, Susruta Samhita, rightly refers rice as 'Aushadh' based on the medicinal qualities of different types of rice landraces. Focus on the past has been shifted to bring to the limelight to realize their present day utility and face the challenges of food security and sustainability. Moreover, breeding protocols for present demand and conservation for future food security need to be planned meticulously, so as to access these potential landraces with simple means by local farmers. The wisdom of rice landraces excerpted from ancient texts can rightly guide planning and implementing scientifically validated choices of traditional varieties against the race of climate change, nutritional balance, and food security.},

abstract={Leptospirosis is a worldwide waterborne zoonosis caused by Leptospira interrogans serovar lai strain 56601 and no specific antibiotics are available to effectively treat the disease to date. The enzyme 3-methyladenine-DNA glycosylase I (LiTagA), which excises 3-methyadenine and 3-methylguanine from alkylated DNA, is an indispensable component for the survival of the bacteria strain, and the absence of the enzyme in human makes it a promising chemotherapeutic target for antileptospiral treatments. In the present study, 578 non-redundant analogs of a few numbers of 3-alkyladenines, experimentally reported inhibitors to the enzyme, were retrieved from the NCI database and their binding affinities on the enzyme (modeled, solvated, and energy minimized at close quarters of physiologic conditions) were screened by means of PyRx - a high throughput virtual screening tool - and AutoDock. Using a lead identified from the studies as a seed, a small focussed combinatorial library containing 200 de novo inhibitors to the enzyme was generated and the compounds were subjected to affinity filter, bioavailability filter, and toxicity filter by means of an array of computational tools. Combined comprehensive analysis on the data obtained from the various filters brought out few numbers of efficient de novo inhibitors to the Leptospira interrogans LiTagA enzyme and also revealed that 5-H-indeno[1,2-b]pyridine system flanked by cationic and anionic chemical moieties at sites 9th and 12th positions, respectively, is an essential skeleton for the highly potent inhibitors to the enzyme. Moreover, implications of the studies on designing drug-likeness de novo inhibitors to protein targets have also been discussed in detail. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Parkinson's is a major neurodegenerative disorder that occurs due to loss of dopaminergic neurons in basal ganglia. Conventional therapy includes surgery that involves lot of risk and administration of levodopa which is accompanied by poor bioavailability, short half-life, and side effects. In the present study, poly(butylene succinate) (PBSu) microspheres-based drug delivery system to improve the bioavailability of the drug levodopa was evaluated for the first time. Biodegradable porous and smooth PBSu microspheres were prepared by double emulsion solvent evaporation technique (W/O/W) and the effect of solvent and surfactant was studied. The maximum encapsulation efficiency achieved was 53.93% and 62.28% for porous and smooth microspheres, respectively. In vitro drug release was studied in phosphate buffered saline and simulated CSF buffer of pH 7.4. Initially a burst effect followed by sustained release of drug was obtained for about 32 h and 159 h for porous and smooth microspheres, respectively. The release rate was higher in simulated CSF when compared with PBS, due to higher concentration of sodium ions and cations in simulated CSF. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={The quality of the weld joint is highly influenced by the welding parameters. Hence accurate prediction of weld bead parameters is highly essential to achieve good quality joint. This paper presents development of neural network models for predicting bead parameters such as depth of penetration, bead width and depth to width ratio for AISI 202 grade stainless steel GTAW plates. The use of this series in certain applications ended in failure of the product as there is no adequate level of user knowledge. Hence it becomes imperative to go for detailed investigations on this grade before recommending it for any application. The process parameters chosen for the study are welding current, welding speed, gas flow rate and welding gun angle. The chosen output parameters were depth of penetration, bead width and depth to width ratio. The experiments were conducted based on design of experiments using fractional factorial with 125 runs. Using the experimental data feed forward back propagation neural net work models were developed and trained using Levenberg Marquardt algorithm. The training, learning, performance and transfer functions used are trainlm, learningdm, MSE and tansig respectively. Four networks were developed with four neurons for the input layer, 3 neurons for the output layer and different nodes for the hidden layer. They are 4 - 2 - 3, 4 - 4 - 3, 4 - 8 - 3 and 4 - 9 - 3. It was found that ANN model based on network 4 - 9 - 3 predicted the bead dimensions more accurately than the other networks. The prediction of weld bead geometry parameters helps in identifying the recommended combination of process parameters to achieve good quality joint. Copyright © 2013.},

The effect of sputtering power on the structural, optical and morphological properties of the films was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), photoluminescence spectrometer, UV-vis spectrometer and scanning electron microscope (SEM), respectively. From the XRD pattern, it is inferred that (002) oriented peaks is present in all the samples prepared under various sputtering powers. The presence of a strong single UV emission at 385 nm is attributed to the near band edge emission, confirming that the film have less defect density signifying the high crystal quality of the samples. The films were highly transparent with sharp absorbance edges, and average visible transmittance is of 90%. SEM micrographs revealed that the grains become more uniform with very little mismatch with the surface of c-cut sapphire substrate, with increase of sputtering power. The film prepared at the dc power of 40 W results in a layer containing well shaped hexagonal wurtzite ZnO. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.},

abstract={In the present study, a solar drier is designed and fabricated with evacuated tube collectors and its performance is studied for drying ginger under the meteorological condition of Thanjavur district, Tamilnadu, India. Ginger is also dried separately by natural sun drying and is compared with the designed drier. Ginger is used in treating variety of ailments due to its high medicinal properties. The drier is employed with different air velocity flow rates (4 m/s, 4.25 m/s, 4.5 m/s, 4.75 m/s, 5 m/s). Drying of ginger in the designed drier reduces the average initial moisture content from 85.62% to a final moisture content of 0.92% in 6 hours. This is less than half the time taken by natural sun drying (13 hours). The efficiency of the drier varied from 31% - 40.4% for different air flow rates. The results show that the rate of drying is more if the air flow is more. It is also found that the quality of the dried ginger in the designed solar drier is high as compared to the one dried in natural sun drying. From the performance, quality and quick rate of drying it is evident that solar drier with evacuated tube collector is more compatible than other driers.},

abstract={An Ultrasonic under-sodium scanner has been developed for use in Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR), Kalpakkam, India. An ultrasonic scanning technique already developed enables us to determine the in-situ 'bow', if any, of the Fuel Sub-Assembly (FSA) in reactor by two methods viz 'circle-fitting' and 'data-based'. This paper proposes another method viz Hough Transform by which we are able to determine the center of the circular top surface of a mock-up FSA head using its under-water image obtained in an earlier scanning experiment. A program written in MATLAB script carries out Hough transformation of four sparsely scanned images of the head kept at distances of 135 to 165 mm from the scanner-axis. We have devised a 'composite' Hough Transform algorithm to obtain the 'true' center coordinates and hence the scanner axis-FSA head distance values to an accuracy of 3 mm for distances up to 155 mm, and 5 mm for 165 mm distance. © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={An attempt was made to develop a computational model based on artificial neural network and ant colony optimization to estimate the composition of medium components for maximizing the productivity of Penicillin G Acylase (PGA) enzyme from Escherichia coli DH5α strain harboring the plasmid pPROPAC. As a first step, an artificial neural network (ANN) model was developed to predict the PGA activity by considering the concentrations of seven important components of the medium. Design of experiments employing central composite design technique was used to obtain the training samples. In the second step, ant colony optimization technique for continuous domain was employed to maximize the PGA activity by finding the optimal inputs for the developed ANN model. Further, the effect of a combination of ant colony optimization for continuous domain with a preferential local search strategy was studied to analyze the performance. For a comparative study, the training samples were fed into the response surface methodology optimization software to maximize the PGA production. The obtained PGA activity (56.94 U/mL) by the proposed approach was found to be higher than that of the obtained value (45.60 U/mL) with the response surface methodology. The optimum solution obtained computationally was experimentally verified. The observed PGA activity (55.60 U/mL) exhibited a close agreement with the model predictions. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Wireless networks are capable solutions for many industrial and commercial applications. However, a wireless node endures with lots of constraints such as low computation ability, little memory, partial energy resources and so on. In secure communication, different numbers of end devices are used to share the information between wireless devices and also are protected with the help of crypto algorithm and secret keys. The secret keys play a very important role than the algorithm, to ensure the security of the information between different numbers of users. When members of a group need to accept the similar information security and are permitted to dynamically join or leave the group, security entails not only sharing of a secret among lots of users but also be worried with security services like confidentiality, integrity of information as the connection changes. Whenever the system changes, the system manager is responsible to change the secret and supporting keys and to send back the updated keys to the group members. These different numbers of secret keys used in the end devices are generated using software and hardware techniques. In this study the different numbers of secret keys are generated using hardware. LPC 2148 are used to generate the random secret session key with real time parameters, event driven circuits and temperature measurement unit. In all the scenarios, the randomness, issues in hardware are analyzed and discussed. © 2013 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

abstract={In real time it is difficult to access certain places by humans. So, it is better to use a robot that can be controlled from a remote location using voice commands. Our project is to develop a voice based system that works with respect to the commands given in Run time. We are developing a Robot that is controlled by voice commands. The words are recognized using MATLAB. The voice commands include forward, reverse, left turn, right turn etc. After recognizing the words the commands are transmitted to an 8051Microcontroller based system through RF module and RS232 interface. The 8051 is, respectively programmed to control the motor connected to the robot. This project involves both signal processing and communication. The word recognition part is implemented by extracting the formants feature of the speech signals and the values are listed in an excel sheet database. Then, k-Nearest neighbor algorithm based classifier is used to compare the run time input voice with the database. The classifier output gives the word to which the voice command corresponds .The serial communication part involves the transmitting of data with respect to the command detected through an RF module working at 434 MHZ frequency. The data received at the receiver side is decoded and an 8051 based system is used for controlling the motors of the robot. © 2013 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

abstract={In cosmopolitan expanses, parking of vehicles has become a major problem as it is becoming unproductive. It is also one of the key causes of city traffic congestion. A mechanism is needed to monitor the parking area. Other associated issues such as lighting of large parking lots and tracking availability of parking spots need to be addressed. The proposed study discussed these issues and gave a solution by employing Open Source Gate Initiative (OSGi), a middleware that helps in efficient communication. The parking system discussed here integrates various communication standards such as the SMS features of a standardized mobile, ZigBee enabled proximity sensors and a system meant for storage and processing of the data. The proposed architecture eliminates the hassles of searching empty parking spots and thus can save a lot of time on a daily basis for the general public who own and use a vehicle for commuting. The merits of this study compared with the existing models are emphasized here. This study also highlighted the advantages of using a standardized middleware such as OSGi for the communication between sensors and a system meant for the storage and processing of the obtained data. © 2013 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

abstract={Transformers are basic design of electrical device which provide power transmission by transforming induced current from one circuit to another. The induced current can be converted step up or step down of current or voltage. This application mainly concentrates on the three-phase transformers which are used in between electric poles and the Power transformers. The real time controlling is done on the basic features like gas level, oil aging and regulation of overload and temperature maintenance. These features are essential for effective power transmission and long life of industrial transformers. The monitoring and control of the transformer is done by using ARM7 processor, RF transmission for wireless communication and sensors which check the level of gas, aging of oil, overload and maintain temperature by regular observation. There are various transformer maintenance techniques but this paper gives a real time monitoring and controlling of transformers by using ARM7 processor which replace the bulky computers making it as embedded system. The design is to sense the features of transformer and send the information regularly to the processor, the processor in turn will makes the transmission through RF to the client. So, this design makes possible to attain real time control and monitoring of oil, gas, overload and temperature range in the transformer. © 2013 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

This study demonstrates a variable-to-variable length based compression technique called Run-Length based Efficient Compression. The patterns which are selected for doing compression can be partitioned into blocks having equal width. The partitioned blocks can be compared with the adjacent one and can be merged. A control code is used to denote the number of blocks merged.

abstract={Experiments were conducted on the preparation of manganese ferrite nanoparticles and their surface modification for dispersion in propylene glycol. The appropriate concentrations of ferrous sulphate and manganese sulphate (precursors) for synthesis of uniform Mn0.43Fe2.57O 4 nanoparticles (size range ~20-25 nm) were found to be 0.05 and 0.025 M, respectively. These nanoparticles were coated with citric acid and dispersed in propylene glycol for the preparation of nanofluids. The effects of temperature and nanoparticle concentration on nanofluid viscosity and thermal conductivity have been studied. Our study on the influence of nanoparticle concentration on viscosity reveals the existence of a viscosity minimum for 0.25 vol% of citric acid-modified Mn0.43Fe2.57O 4-propylene glycol nanofluid. A thermal conductivity enhancement of 68 % was observed for 2 vol% nanofluid. Correlating viscosity and thermal conductivity measurements, particle clustering seems to be the major factor responsible for thermal conductivity enhancement. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={This paper gives the new set-up of inverter having DC current source (CSI) having no insulated switching device. In the proposed new CSI topology every switching device are connected across a common-source level, thus a single power supply gate drive circuit is required and no insulated power supply and the customary bootstrap circuit is applied. This CSI topology is even legitimate for utmost level of current waveform output, where the power switches number increases. As a turn up, gate drive complexity is reduced, and it also eliminates the cost of capacitors and transformers in switching devices, driver circuits. In addition, this new topology of current-source PWM inverter (CSI) can operate even at utmost switching frequency, as every switches will be connected across a common source level. In this paper the different level of proposed CSI operation principle, its design using computer simulation (MATLAB) with its total harmonic distortion (THD) is analyzed. The computer simulation using MATLAB determines the feasibility of this topology with the analysis of different level which results in reduction of its complexity and the physical size.},

Augmented reality is the grouping of virtual entity or 3D stuffs which are overlapped on live camera feed information. The decisive aim of augmented reality is to enhancing the virtual video and a 3D object onto a real world on which it will raise the person's conceptual understanding of the subject. In this paper we described a solution for initial prediction of tumour cells in MRI images of human brain using image processing technique the output of which will be the 3D sliced image of the human brain. The sliced image is then virtually embedded on the top of human head during the time of surgery so that the surgeon can exactly locate the spot to be operated.

Mammograms play an important tool in early detection of breast cancer. Cancer that originates from the breast tissue is called as Breast Cancer. Cancer originating from the inner lining of milk ducts is called as Ductal Carcinomas (70%). Cancer originating from the lobules which are the glands that produce milk is called as Lobular Carcinomas (15%). Breast Cancer occurs in humans and other mammals. Every 74 seconds, somewhere in the world, someone dies from breast cancer, in which the majority is woman. Approximately 425,000 women around the world died from the disease in 2010. At this rate, 10.6 million women will die from breast cancer during the next 25 years. It is 100 times more common in women than in men. Mammography is a specific type of imaging that uses a low dose X-Ray system to examine breast cancers. Mammography exam is called Mammogram. In our proposed project, Image processing techniques are used in accurate and timely detection of Breast Cancer in high resolution medical images. Collected images from the database are segmented using Marker-Controlled Watershed segmentation method. The segmented image is then enhanced and the features are extracted using Gabor filter. Another methodology of Circular Hough Transform is used to obtain 3-Dimensional image of the Cancer.},

abstract={Clouds are important for climatic changes in the atmosphere. Cloud images are taken by visible and infrared satellites. Both visible and infrared satellites, the clouds that are not very white are called Thin Clouds. So, the identification of a thin cloud is hard to find out. In this paper, some algorithms for spotting thin clouds are proposed. They are HSL (Hue Saturation Light), ROI (Region of Interest), Watershed, Demirel and Color Segmentation. HSL (Hue Saturation Light) is used for finding the ratio of color in the cloud image, ROI (Region of Interest) is used for removing the cloud and the sky elements of the cloud image, Watershed and Demirel algorithm are used to segment the Thin Clouds. The extract values from the cloud image are measured using Gaussian Filter. The weather forecasting is carried out by comparing the images in the database after performing color segmentation by k-means clustering.},

abstract={This paper demonstrated the design of a wireless sensor network to monitor patients suffering from chronic diseases in their homes without regularly going to health center. Presently, most of the monitoring systems use personal computers (PC) to send patient's health data (ECG in this case) to the hospital from patient's home. Here, the idea is to eliminate the need of a PC thereby having a major cost reduction and still have a sustainable and effective system in place. The remote monitoring system consists of a WSN (wireless sensor network) in which nodes are placed in a patient's home. These nodes are connected to a central node which is installed at the hospital through an internet connection. The nodes of the WSN consists of ECG sensors, PIC microcontroller, CC2500 low power wireless radio. At first ECG signals are sampled by a portable device which is connected to patient to be monitored. The sampled signals are then transmitted wirelessly to an access point located in the patient's home through a CC2500 which works at a frequency of 2.4GHz. The access point is then connected to the internet through digital subscriber line router. Later, the data collected are sent to the hospital via internet for storage and further analysis. This remote monitoring can be advantageous in several ways. It can significantly reduce the cost of the entire setup by eliminating the need of a PC. There is a reduction in time to send the data as the need of turning the PC on every time has been diminished.},

abstract={In this recent multimedia world, the major challenges are the optimized use of storage space and Bandwidth. Compression plays the crucial role to reduce the storage space of images and transmission of information with limited Bandwidth availability without degrading the quality of image. Inorder to fulfil the above demand, in literature various compression algorithms were proposed for different applications. In this paper, we evaluated the performance of Wavelet Support vector machines (WSVM) with different combinations of kernel function and wavelets.SVM regression is applied to wavelet coefficients inorder to approximate the obtained coefficients from wavelets so that better compression can be achieved by removing the additional redundancy. From training data and realized compression, Support Vector Machine Regression (SVMR) has the possibility to learn about the dependency by the use of support vectors inorder to represent the real data and to eradicate redundancy. .Run-length coding is used to encode the support vectors and its corresponding weights, obtained from the SVM regression. Performance evaluation of WSVM is done in terms of compression Ratio, MSE and PSNR Experimental results shows that the compression performance can be improved with rbio4.4 combined with RBF kernel gives high compression ratio without loss in the image quality.},

abstract={Low power VLSI testing is indispensible in switching components and number of hardware/software-based techniques has been still developed to minimize the dynamic power dissipation. In earlier days, primary concerns of VLSI design were focused in area, performance, cost and reliability. But in current years, the design constraints have begun to change because of increasing low power testing. XOR network based techniques have been widely implemented for large scan chain design owing to its high compression ratio. The proposed work explores the reduction of scan power by reducing the number of switching in the XOR network. This work is also associated with Travelling Salesman problem to find out the least number of switching.},

abstract={Network security has acquired appreciable attention among business communities. Firewall act as a frontier defense and plays a significant role for establishing secure communication in networks against unauthorized traffic occurred in network. Firewall policies deployed in firewall, directs the firewalls to handle network traffic for particular IP addresses and protocols. Although deployment of firewall technology improves security in our network, managing firewall policies is a challengeable process due to the composite character of rules in firewall policy, on the other hand policy rules created by the system administrators face difficulty in resolving policy conflicts. To address all the aforementioned issues, we need effective firewall conflict management framework. In this effort, we propose efficacious framework to treat the policy conflict in firewalls based on risk assessment of conflicts. We identify the risk level of the policy conflict on the basis of vulnerability assessment in the secured network. Our major contribution in this paper involves the utilization of novel technique called Dynamic Rule Reordering that effectively optimizes the filtering policies in firewall. The proposed Rule reordering algorithm dynamically optimizes the conflicted rule reordering and leads to the accomplishment of most ideal solution for conflict resolution. We perform extensive evaluation and experiments to show the efficiency of our proposed rule reordering, which reorder the conflicted rules.},

abstract={Many internet applications need live multimedia data to be transmitted over the network. To incorporate the same, applications like video conferencing and e-learning need IP multicast or unicast. However in internet applications, lack of multicast services play a deterrent role in group communication. When live multimedia data is transferred to more than one receiver over the network, the more number of duplicate packets are transferred. Due to this duplicate packets, bandwidth and other resources are not properly utilized. When network connection is slow then clustering duplicate packets takes place in link. Due to this clustering, there is a chance for the data loss to occur. A CacheCast mechanism can be used on the router to eliminate such type of duplicate packets. Cache is placed on the router which acts independently for the sender and receiver. In single source multiple destinations, while transferring live multimedia data to more number of receivers, the duplicate packets may occur on the link. All duplicate packets are removed at the nearest router of sender and retrieved from the nearest router of receiver. This technique is used to achieve the better utilization of bandwidth. When send the live data to more than one receiver, bandwidth is efficiently used and the receiver's side original data has to be reconstructed without any discrepancies.},

As the users will be charged based on their usage the effective utilization of resources poses a major challenge. To accomplish this, a service request scheduling algorithm which reduces the waiting time of the task in the scheduler and maximizes the Quality of Service (QoS) is needed. Our proposed algorithm named Effective Resource Utilization Algorithm (ERUA) is based on 3-tier cloud architecture (Consumer, Service Provider and the Resource Provider) which benefits both the user (QoS) and the service provider (Cost) through effective schedule reallocation based on utilization ratio leading to better resource utilization. Performance analysis made with the existing scheduling techniques shows that our algorithm gives out a more optimized schedule and enhances the efficiency rate.},

abstract={Cloud computing is the collection of networked computers sharing the resources on-demand. The increasing use of cloud computing over the globe has brought into focus a need to design a secure cloud storage system. For safe and satisfactory implementation of the same, there is a need to place emphasis on the problems arising in the same. The chief one is the unauthorized access which prevents data confidentiality. A secure cloud storage model guarantees security and robustness. The essential task is to encrypt the data before storing it for security purposes. This paper deals with the uncertainties of using centralized and de-centralized storage systems. It also explains the various encryption techniques used to prevent the information from eavesdropping.},

Using the early strength obtained after the two-phase curing and the curing parameters, regression equations were developed to predict the 28-day compressive strength. For the accelerated curing (higher temperature curing) both conduction and radiation heating methods were attempted. The results show that multiple linear regression model, which uses the conduction heating process, performs best.},

Some of the major drawbacks in OFDM are its high peak-to-average-power ratio(PAPR) of the transmitted signals and the synchronization of signals. OFDM consist of large number of independent subcarriers, as a result of which the amplitude of such a signal can have high peak values. Coding, phase rotation and clipping are among many PAPR reduction schemes that have been proposed to overcome this problem. Significant reduction in PAPR has been achieved using Partial Transmit Sequence(PTS) which comes under Signal scrambling techniques.},

abstract={The notion of non-linear dynamics has become an energetic and fashionable field of work that is having a thoughtful effect on a wide variety of topics in present day technology. One such evolution of non-linear dynamics is the chaos theory. It is not about disorder, rather is about very complicated systems of order. However, the point of interest lies in bridging the gap between random nature of chaotic signals and the demanding needs of Information safety. Hence, Safety via ambiguity is employed to ensure correct and complete transaction of data. A good solution to bring ambiguity is to materialize the message signal as unsystematic information. Consequently, Safety via ambiguity is resolved by a technique called Chaos shift keying. The technique is all about replacing one's and zero's of the message signal by the chaotic signals. The simulated results and future scope are discussed. It has been found that CSK modulated waveform looks exactly like a wideband noise. Hence even if a third party tries to hack the system, nobody can be able to judge any significant information is present or not.},

The main concentration of this work was on vehicle navigation, tracking, obstacle detection, weight overload, battery power measuring and also be able to locate the respective service station goods. Vehicle navigation employs RFID technology. The RFID reader is installed in the vehicle and reads the tags which are placed along its route. Whenever a vehicle reaches a service station it sends a message to the workers. Upon receiving a message, the workers can collect the respective service station goods using RFID. If the wrong goods are taken out of the vehicle, the buzzer gets activated. The obstacle detection can be done by ultrasonic sensors. If any obstacle in the route is detected, the message is sent to the control station of the industry using the GSM module. The load cell is used to indicate the weight overload to the workers. Two batteries have been together utilized to measure the required power by this developed vehicle. As soon as Battery1 becomes dry, the battery2 is made the main source of power and a message is sent to the control station through GSM. The control station having a GSM module receives the message and the result will be displayed in hyper terminal window on the PC (personal computer). The vehicle transportation uses PIC microcontroller, sensors and wireless technology.},

The peers are sometimes referred as leechers, the leecher is somebody who is currently downloading the file, the seeder is somebody who is currently uploading a file and tracker is theone who keeps track of all the activities of leecher and seeder. This paper mainly focuses onfile sharing in cheap and effective peer to peer system, which suffers due to slow uploading and downloading and bandwidth lacking fairness. In this paper we report on experiments conductedto pin point the cause to increase the Bandwidth in uploading the data. And so we are proposing a new system using the k-nearest neighbour algorithm to ensure fairness. KNN algorithm isthesimplest of all machines learning algorithms. By using this algorithm the objects are classified and grouped by neighbour's voting providing rendering the shortest path among varying neighbours. K-is the smallest integer. If K=+1, then the object is grouped to the class of nearest neighbours. Thus our proposed methodology results in bandwidth fairness by increasing theperformance of downloading and providing bandwidth in a uniform manner.},

In this paper, we proposed the novel approach in which we used wavelet based sub band energy as a feature vector to discriminate normal and abnormal images. We used DB3, Symlet, RBio( 3.3,3.5,3.7) and we extracted the energy signature of various sub bands. Feature ranking and selection is done by using chi square test and consistency subset evaluation method. Thirteen features we used to classify the image using Support Vector Machine Classifer. We have collected the images from Vasan Eye Care Hospital, Thanjavur, Tamilnadu, India and with the guidance of ophthalmologist we have bifurcated normal and abnormal images for testing the proposed method. We obtained the accuracy of 93% with the combination of RBIO and SVM. Among the sub band energies we got high discriminatory power for diagonal and vertical sub band energies.},

abstract={In recent years, several researches are being done to improve the means by which humans interact with machines. Having developed a variety of input devices, we still are not completely comfortable with the present human-machine interaction processes. This stirred up the efforts undertaken to make the machines adapt to the human's natural means of communication which are speech and body language. The objective of this paper is to implement a real-time vision system which offers better comfort to humans while interacting with machines. In our paper, we showed a simple but efficient method to implement a hand posture recognition system and by means of which we control a bot wirelessly through Bluetooth. The simplicity of our method enables fast recognition of the hand postures shown and therefore achieves the real-time continuous control over the bot.},

abstract={Sensing of spectrum holes in a frequency spectrum is one of the important concepts in implementing a cognitive radio system. Cognitive radio provides a way to use the band width effectively and efficiently by identifying the spectrum holes in a particular spectrum. The presence of cyclostationary features indicates the absence or presence of primary users. The presence of signal or noise can be determined by calculating the threshold of a signal by using cyclic cross-periodogram matrix of the corresponding signal. To circumvent the difficulty in estimating the accurate threshold (statistical techniques were used by other researchers), an artificial neural network has been trained by extracted cyclostationary feature vectors which have been obtained by FFT accumulation method. 70% of extracted data has been used for training and the rest 30% has been used for testing the efficiency of the network in estimating 99% accurate prediction of the threshold. The regression plot clearly indicates the superiority of the proposed scheme in estimating the threshold. Similar threshold samples derived from the data (other samples) have also been experimented in this scheme, which provided consistently good results with reduced MSE.},

Intelligent transport system embodies several functionalities such as traffic monitoring, parking assistant, and vehicle monitoring by making the system smarter. Parking plays a vital role amongst them. Developing countries are facing major parking management problems. Most of the available parking methods do not satisfy the user's requirements. The biggest challenge in parking lies in how well the monitored information is being communicated from sensor nodes to users effectively and also the method being employed to carry out this. Timeliness, accuracy, reliability, and security are some of the important characteristics in a parking management system to be considered. Any parking management system must be able to provide features like accounting, dynamic allotment of slots, security management, statistical reporting along with detecting the count of vehicles inside a parking zone. This paper discusses some of the commonly used techniques in parking management and identifies the problems present in their methodologies.},

abstract={The vast alert generation of IDS in the network is the major problem. It is the vital task to find solutions to reduce the alerts. Novel techniques namely Fuzzy Association rule and Fuzzy art map are proposed to identify attacks optimally and to reduce alerts. The execution time is reduced by placing the level of severity and importance. All alerts that are issued by IDSs are not on the same level of severity and importance. It would be great if the system can identify which alerts are highly important and which are not, so that the number of alerts that need to be dealt with can be reduced. The alert is reduced by finding out the attacks accurately using various methods. The Membership function is used to classify the attack as low, mid or high using continuous attribute. The rules are set for each attack using fuzzy association rule. The chi-square, confidence and support values are estimated for each rule and the minimum value will be set for all parameters .The Rules higher than the verge value are taken and the rules for each generation are updated. Then the rules are compared with test data set and calculated the match degree for each attack. The proposed fuzzy association rule is to obtain superlative features. The Fuzzy art map technique is used to classify the intrusion and normal data by calculating the match degree. Hence this technique aims to effectively reduce the alert rate when compared with existing approaches.},

abstract={Spectrum sensing method is the fundamental factor when we are working with cognitive radio systems. Main aim and fundamental problem of cognitive radio is to identify weather primary users in authorized or licensed spectrum is presented or not. Paper deals with a new scheme of sensing based on the eigenvalues concept. It contain signals of covariance matrix received by the secondary users. In this method we are suggested two algorithms of sensing, one algorithm established by the maximum to minimum eigenvalue ratio. Other algorithm focused on average to minimum eigenvalue ratio. These two are done by using random matrix theories (RMT), and also these RMT are latest and also produce some accurate results. Now we calculate the ratios of distributions and probabilities of detection (Pd) and derive the probabilities of false alarm (Pfa) for the proposed algorithms, and also finding thresholds values for given Pfa. This method will improve the problem of noise uncertainty, and also performance is improved compare to energy detection when highly correlated signal is available. Paper also deals with another method is and also covariance methods. First one is statistical covariance method, it has different noise and received signal, and it is used for finding the primary users presence where there is only noise. These algorithms implemented by use of small number of received signal samples and processed to calculate the sample covariance matrix. By use of sample covariance matrix we are extracted two test statistics. Finally we compare these results and concluded that signal presence. These are used in many signal detection applications, and also do not need signal information, also noise power and channel. We did the Simulations based on two ways. First one is randomly generated signals. Other one is done by captured DTV signals taken from ATSV committee, these are broadcasting signals. These methods confirm and verifies the efficiency of the proposed methods.},

abstract={The valve testing unit is a high pressure test equipment to test the valve manufactured in industries. Valves are tested to ensure that they sustain high pressure in the range of 10000 to 15000 PSI for the required amount of time without any leakage. It has few drawbacks such as inefficient usage of power, fatal accidents due to the proximity of the users with the testing unit to note the valve pressure during operation. It is much dangerous for the industry personnel to note the valve pressure for every minute during operation. There are chances of bolts fitted in the valve thrown away due to the issues in the bolt fittings and the immense pressure inside the valve. Therefore in order to avoid fatal accidents and to improve the industrial safety an efficient valve testing unit is designed and developed using ZigBee wireless transmission technology. The proposed efficient pressure monitoring unit uses emerging technologies like ZigBee, RFID along with ARM 7 processor. The proposed system uses LabVIEW software to develop the monitoring unit in PC. ZigBee wireless transmission technology is used for remote monitoring of valve pressure for every minute. RFID module is used for uniquely identifying the valve and to track the test results. The proposed unit saves energy by sending a signal to turn off the air driven booster pump once the prescribed pressure level is reached. The proposed unit also indicates the oil level of the test unit which avoids the manual intervention to verify the oil level and also detects issues in the bolts fitted in the valve by using a distance sensor which is to avoid fatal accidents by stopping the valve testing unit.},

abstract={The trend in VLSI and system design is moving away from high speed to low power due to the rapid growth in the portable consumer electronics market. The technology evolution of deep submicron (DSM) will be able to manage the needs and demands of future computing world. A rapid growth of future computing have led to challenges of very deep submicron (DSM) regime. Here, the leakage power plays a major contributor to the total power dissipation involved in the circuit as the threshold voltage becomes small while we reduce the operating supply voltage. We present some techniques to reduce the power dissipation involved while interconnecting logic blocks in the Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). The interconnections or connectivity among logic blocks are done by routing switches. We use pass-transistor logic, transmission logic and multiplexers for the construction of these routing switches. We present a technique which has both sleep mode in which the leakage power is reduced and low-power mode in which the dynamic power is reduced. These models are built by using Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools like DSCH (Digital Schematic) and Microwind layout tools using BSIM4 MOSFET model in 60 nm technology. Results show that the pass-transistor approach is having low power consumption . The leakage and dynamic power are also reduced by the circuit which has the programmability option to change sleep mode and low-power mode.},

abstract={In order to improve the reliability and availability in distributed networks, the occurrence of failures are to be predicted. Fault Prediction aims at predicting failure before they occur in Distributed Systems. This is possible by closely observing the behavior of the network. Network packets get latest information of network for every instant. The proposed work uses standard method to analyze network packets and simple mathematical calculations and timed automata in order to estimate Time-To-Failure (TTF). This method is able to detect only observable faults.},

abstract={Mobile Ad hoc Network is a compilation of wireless mobile terminals that are in contact with each other in the absence of a permanent infrastructure network. This gives a irregular formation. Many resources like power, energy, reliable data delivery and end to end delay plays a significant role in the network. But due to the dynamic movement of nodes, power management and energy conservation stands as a critical area. This is also due to the limited battery power and the maximum utilization of power by the nodes in the network .The responsibility of saving power has increased and it is possible by minimizing the consumption during the routing process. It is done in order to expand the lifetime of the network. In view of such a vital position, we introduce a new algorithm using an MAODV( Modified Ad Hoc On-Demand Distance Vector Routing Protocol) protocol which exactly concentrates on power awareness at the time of route selection. Power status of each and every node is observed to avoid excess consumption. It also makes sure that there is a rise in the speed of route selection and discovery process. Route Patch-Up scheme used in this algorithm results in optimum utilization of power using an Modified AODV (MAODV) protocol. Thus the idea proposed provides better performance through simulation over NS2.},

abstract={Data mining is the exploration and evaluation of large quantity of data to discover substantial, novel, useful and effectively understandable data. Hence determining the knowledge of a document becomes a necessary task in data mining. There are three approaches of metadata in general. They are stylistic, machine learning and knowledge bases. Sometimes the problem occurs when mining a document that contains polysemic words which leads to irrelevant extraction and increased processing time. Polysemy refers to coexistence of many possible meaning for a word or phrase. In order to extract exact information, polysemy like issue should be solved. This work uses knowledge based metadata to extract information using Domain-based Information Extraction technique (DIE). Hence this work targets in solving polysemy which can increases the accuracy of information extraction and reduce processing time.

abstract={In the present world the security vulnerabilities are highly challenging in MANET. To getthe maximum security and minimum threat there is lots of work going on. To effectively isolatethe malicious node this paper proposes a Neuro fuzzy algorithm. By using fuzzy logic we can further improve the security level by identifying the malicious node more accurately. The concept behind the paper is as in real life scenario, trust and sharing. Here in this paper we use the concept of trusting supporters, sharing the companion list and routing through data. In order to get a secure high trust level, fuzzy logic is applied for evaluating routing response and isolates the malicious node. Trusted route is evaluated in sequence of operation and data istransferred at a most trusted level. Trust values are computed to each node by setting verge values. The values of each node is checked with the verge value. If the value higher than the verge value mark it as high trusted node or else low trusted node.The fuzzy logic is implemented using aarmp routing protocol. Thus the level of trust is increased to obtain accuracy of identification. The goal of getting a robust route without any malicious node is achieved.},

abstract={Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), in the recent past is being preferably used in wireless communication because of its high data rate and its unique property of the transmitted symbols being mathematically orthogonal. This mathematical orthogonality allows signals with different frequencies to propagate in the same subcarrier unlike traditional Frequency Division Multiplexing Technique (FDM) where each piece of information is propagated with a single carrier which saves the additional guard period there by giving robustness to the system from impairments due to frequency fading caused by multipath propagation and Inter Symbol Interference(ISI). Through this paper it was inferred that adding security and authenticity(encryption) followed cons though there were considerable amount of pros. Secured Hash Algorithm(SHA 1) conceals the data by furnishing an unrecognizable distinct hundred and sixty bits digest. This gave rise to reliable protection but eventuated increased Bit Error Rate(BER) . The 160 bits hash sequences contributes to larger bit error rate emanating from the fact that greater number of bits results in greater probability of BER.},

abstract={Electronic Voting play a really vital role in the democracy of our life. In this paper, we propose an electronic voting protocol. Our scheme does not require a special voting channel and communication can occur entirely over the current Internet. This method integrates the Internet convenience and cryptology. In the existing protocol the Tallier has to wait until the decryption key is received from the voter. So it will consume lot of time. But, the proposed protocol is based on the hybrid cryptosystem. In this, the ballot is encrypted using faster secret key algorithm and the digital envelope is encrypted using Tallier's public key. So, the Tallier will decrypt the digital envelope using his own private key to get the secret key and then the encrypted ballot is decrypted using that secret key. So, comparatively the proposed protocol consumes less time. This paper also analyzes the various security issues involved in an electronic voting like security, privacy, authentication, anonymous, uniqueness, accuracy, fairness, efficiency and uncoercibility.},

This paper demonstrates the use of the GLAAM's efficient iterative matching scheme for image interpretation. We use the GLAAM as a basis for face identification, obtain good results for difficult images. We show how the GLAAM framework allows identity information to be decoupled from other variation, allowing evidence of identity to be integrated over a sequence. The GLAAM approach makes optimal use of the evidence from either a single image or image sequence. Since we derive a complete description of a given image our method can be used as the basis for a range of face image interpretation tasks.},

Almost every cell phone has Bluetooth® transceiver for connecting to a wireless headset or to a host PC. Many new cars have Bluetooth to let you talk hands free while driving. Bluetooth has thus emerged as a pervasive technology. The aim of the paper is to describe a Personnel Security System using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Tag which operates on a coin cell battery that will discover all the available low energy devices in the vicinity and keep track of when it entered and when it left the zone. In addition, this tag can also be used as a positioning device by measuring the Received Signal Strength (RSSI) value. The initial phase is aimed at designing the hardware for the tag. The second phase is initiated towards programming the tag. The final phase is targeted towards testing the designed hardware module and developing a Personnel Security System.},

In this study, shifted second kind Chebyshev wavelet (CW) operational matrices of derivatives is introduced and applied for solving the second order differential equations with various initial conditions. The key idea for getting the numerical solutions for these equations is to convert the differential equations (linear or nonlinear) to a system of linear or nonlinear algebraic equations in the unknown expansion coefficients. Some illustrative examples are given to demonstrate the validity and applicability of the proposed method. The power of the manageable method is confirmed. Moreover the use of the shifted second kind Chebyshev wavelet method (CWM) is found to be simple, flexible, efficient, small computation costs and computationally attractive.},

abstract={Cloud computing is a prominent way to support demand on services. It is a mode of computing where scalable resources are delivered as a service to customers over Internet. Scheduling in cloud is responsible for selection of best suitable resources for task execution, by taking some parameters and restrictions of tasks into consideration. From the users view, efficient scheduling may provide factors like fast service, minimum task execution cost etc. On the other hand Service providers should gain factors like to maximum profit, utilize their service efficiently and importantly regular customers. This paper proposes an efficient scheduling algorithm which addresses these major challenges of task scheduling in cloud. The incoming tasks/users can select their method on the basis of task requirement like minimum execution time or cost and then it is prioritized. So the algorithm is named as "TPD Scheduling Algorithm", Here T stands for Task Selection, P Stands for Priority(in terms of cost) and D stands for Deadline. The proposed model is implemented and tested on simulation toolkit. Results validate the correctness of the framework and show a significant improvement over other scheduling methods.},

abstract={Data mining is a field which explores for exciting knowledge or information from existing substantial group of data. In particular, algorithms like Apriori aid a researcher to understand the potential knowledge, deep inside the database. However because of the huge time consumed by Apriori to find the frequent item sets and generate rules, several applications cannot use this algorithm. In this paper, the authors describe a novel method for frequent pattern mining, a variation of Apriori Algorithm, which will reduce the time taken for execution to a larger extent. Experiments were conducted with a number of benchmark and real time data sets and it is found that the new algorithm, proposed has better performance in terms of time taken and complexity.},

abstract={Authentication plays an important role in protecting resources against unauthorized use. But currently many user authentication systems suffer from drawbacks and security threats. Simple text based passwords are not secure enough and are a burden on the users to remember. The biometric authentication systems which are used for high security systems need additional hardware and software supports and hence are much expensive and difficult to maintain. For certain applications, research suggests that the use of images may be more effective. This is because humans are far better at recognizing images that they have previously seen than they are at remembering passwords. Hence in this paper, we propose user authentication by using image as passwords (PassImages). Though some systems use images for authentication, it still has some drawbacks which are prone to password attacks. On Analysis of the drawbacks of existing password systems, we have proposed solutions that overcome the vulnerabilities and improve the user authentication system.},

Steganography plays an important role in preventing such information destruction by implementing a principle of imperceptible secret sharing. By this security can be established by clearly embedding data in such a way that the quality of the image is not affected. The existing methodology prevailing now is based on pixel indicator and number of data to be embedded is by pixel value differencing technique. A limitation in this methodology is that the pixel indicator channel is manually selected. The proposed methodology uses pixel indicator channel which is decided using histogram technique and the secret message file has to be embedded in the plane which has the highest color intensity.},

As a first step the Fast Fourier Transform and Inverse Fast Fourier Transform blocks are alternated by Wavelet transform. The main advantage of wavelet transform is the need of cyclic prefix is eliminated as it takes care of Inter symbol interference (ISI) and Inter carrier interference ICI). Second it up thrusts its positions in terms of an efficient system adhering to high data rates only when the order of the wavelet families involved in the process remains conducive. In wireless system the channel being air, is prone to noise, Owing to which the output of the channel is erroneous. As a consequence the error control codes are used which targets at removing the errors from the transmitted bit. Single error control codes are not suitable for high noisy conditions and as a consequence to improve the coding gain concatenation of error control codes is preferred. This study focusses on concatenating convolutional codes with turbo codes. All these techniques enhance the performance of the Multiband OFDM system and make it more appropriate for high data rate wireless applications. In addition the system is trained using neural network .The system is trained using Back propagation algorithm.},

Stochastic uncertainty, which is the changing behavior of the system and the epistemic uncertainty which is hard to set the initial condition of a parameter in the mathematical model due to dynamic nature. This proposed forecast model has the answer for the ongoing issue by means of incorporating sampling method to calculate the true set of inputs to be used in the forecast model. Applying Regression equation, this takes the available weather statistics and gives linear and pellucid relationship of the forecast with least error. Our model has taken several Atmospheric parameters as predictors and the weather is decomposed to several features to get accuracy to its peak. This model exhibit best accuracy, however the predictor/feature is by identifying and discarding the unwanted data and predictor which made least impact on the result without compromising the quality of the prediction. Further identified predictor may refine using neural network to get more reliable result. This study facilitates the duo to bring out notable difference in prevailing method to render the uncertainty along with addressing mathematical imperfection.},

abstract={Money transactions play a vital role in the nature of trade. Today, ATMs and Credit cards are used for this purpose, the authentication of these transactions are unsecure. To overcome this shortcoming of piracy in money transactions, the author proposes the idea of using fingerprints of customers as password in place of traditional pin number. Here, if the fingerprint is recognized, then it allows transaction. This model has an additional feature i.e., a reference fingerprint of the nominee or a close family member of the customer can be used if the customer is not available in case of emergencies. This proposed business model helps the society, mainly the rural people, by enhancing the security using Fingerprint recognition in Digital image processing. As the fingerprint of every person is unique and unchangeable, this biometric feature is used over the others.},

But this is not efficient to handle the large, heterogeneous or multi-featured type of data sources. So an adaptive prediction method is proposed by combining the statistical analysis approach of the data mining methods along with the decision tree prediction methodology. So when dealing with large and multi-server based data, the prediction can be done more effectively and less time consuming than the existing prediction methods. For the statistical analysis, incremental clustering and multiple interesting measures are used for a better prediction.},

abstract={Broadband application of wireless communication calls for good signal to noise ratio (SNR) and variable high data rates. In the midst of a spate of available techniques, Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) has proven to be effective. OFDM systems have high tolerance towards multipath effects in fading channels. Wireless communication will become tortuous in the presence of Inter Symbol Interference (ISI). This complex situation is un-raveled by introducing Cyclic Prefix (CP) prior to transmission over fading channels. In this paper, an idea has been proposed for incorporating Cyclic Prefix (CP), Cyclic Post Fix (CPOF), Zero Padding (ZP) schemes in OFDM system while embedding the secret data for secure data transmission. BER graphs are simulated and compared for various modulation techniques like Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK), Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) and Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) prior to embedding and after embedding the secret data.},

Secret data is sent to the holders as shares but how they decrypt the shares to retrieve the secret is a closed book. Procedures involved in sectoring the secret as shares need to be very intricate enough to attack. Advantages of visual cryptography are no requirement of cover image, unable to recovery with partial shares, litheness, and ease of sending each share in different media and so on. This paper suggests three such methods wherein the shares submit themselves to unequaled manipulative processes and then sent to the holders.

abstract={This paper presents carrier synchronization in software defined radio for 8PSK technique. Software Defined Radio (SDR) plays a major solution for the need for flexibility, upgradability, and the problems of implementing multiple radio standards alternatively and even running several services in parallel. Previously carrier synchronization in software defined radio is implemented using QPSK technique and synchronization is done using PLL concept. The drawback in this we can transmit only few (only two) number of bits while synchronization is performed. The carrier synchronization by software defined radio using 8PSK technique will allow more number (three) of bits during synchronization, and the same bandwidth which is used for QPSK technique. The main advantage is the transmitting of three bits which reduces the time consumption and the synchronization is performed using COSTAS LOOP. The purpose and advantage of Costas loop compared to PLL is error voltage. The error voltage is less in Costas loop, due to this synchronization is performed effectively. The complete codings are coded using MATLAB.},

abstract={Several chemicals have been tested as growth promoters in aquaculture but they cannot be endorsed for commercial processes due to their residual effects in the body of prawns, lobsters and crabs. The concern over environmental hazard, human health and food safety have led to a search for alternative growth promoters significantly to improve the growth of crustaceans with no such effects. Neurohormones, regulatory signalling molecules of crustaceans that coordinate multiple developmental and physiological processes, are major determinants underlying phenotypic integration. Competitive inhibitors for the moult inhibiting hormone receptor are expected to have a direct growth promoting effect on crustaceans by direct involvement in interference with the receptor in the Y-organ, which can cause a surge the production of ecdysteroids. Competitive inhibitors therefore can be regarded as growth promoters in crustacean fishery in addition to various other benefits. This review emphasizes the manifold effects of moult inhibiting hormone, a most versatile animal hormone, with an emphasis on the target sites and competitive inhibition. © 2013 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.},

abstract={The main objective of the present study is to optimize the cultural conditions for maximum production of L-Asparaginase from isolated actinomycetes, under solid state fermentation using sesame (black) oil cake (SOC). To determine the effect of five selected process variables (Temperature, pH, Moisture content, Particle size and Inoculum volume) on the production of L-Asparaginase, a central composite design (CCD) coupled with a surface response analysis was used. Empirical quadratic equations were fitted to the experimental data relevant to the yields of L-Asparaginase with five chosen variables. The application of these optimal conditions allowed an increment of 1.81 times in the final L-Asparaginase activity compared with the non-optimized conditions. The combination of conventional method with CCD was effective and reliable in selecting the statistically significant factors and determining the optimal levels of those factors in fermentation medium. The observations made in this study hold great promise for the maximum production of L-Asparaginase using a cheap raw material in SSF by a novel isolate. This work also demonstrates the usefulness of CCD for determining the optimum conditions for the maximum production of L-Asparaginase. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on production of L-Asparaginase from Micrococcus luteus.},

In this study the thematic maps of Landuse / Landcover map, Road network maps (LISS IV) and Soil map has been prepared by using ArcGIS 9.2 software. The landuse / landcover map of 2003 & 2007 were analyzed and delineated the industrial area & built-up area. In the year 2003, the aerial extent for the SEZ in the study area is 1.2sq.km and it will be extended upto 1.4 sq.km in the year of 2007. The change detection is mostly acquired in Agriculture land & water bodies. The extended area was converted in to shape file format and imported into ExpertGPS software and validated by using Google Earth. During the validation 90% of data exactly merged with Google Earth features. The built-up area of expected Multi-storey building development in that region has been analyzed through GIS software. For increasing Multi-storey building the proportionate development of SEZ was delineated with considering population strength, Water Requirement and Sewage estimation at different FSI conditions. The future population can be estimated at different methods of Arithmetic method, Geometric method, Incremental Increase method & linear method from 2011-2029 with different periods like (2001-2011 and 2011-2029) and compared with previous decade (1991-2011). The growth rate of population was found out 25.8% previously, 29.2% as presently and future it will be expected to change up to 34%. For considering population estimation, other requirements like water and sanitary are also predicted and prepared the thematic map for different FSI. The maximum permissible limits of population at different FSI for SEZ are 84247, 138769 & 196596 respectively. The water demands for three FSI values (1.5, 2.5 & 3.5) were found to be 8888305, 18733815 & 26540460 lpd respectively and the sewage capacity was found out from 7582230 lpd (1.5 FSI) to 17693640 lpd (3.5 FSI). This study has been undertaken in order to understand the impacts of SEZ likely to be created in the physical and social infrastructure in the study area and also to be suggested the remedial measures required to be undertaken to meet the requirement for future population.},

abstract={Pattern recognition of weld defects can be done by partitioning the data points into clusters. The weld defect arises due to various types of adverse conditions and carelessness at the time of welding which leads to major disasters at the later stage. This paper proposes a method for detection of Burn Through, Slag Inclusion and Lack of Penetration weld defects in radiographic images which follow a specific pattern for each type. The image is preprocessed using Histogram equalization and segmented using Region growing methodology. The feature dimension reduction is performed using PCA, which is an unsupervised dimension reduction methodology which chooses the dimensions with the largest variance. K-Means clustering is used for clustering a cohesive group from a set of patterns after performing dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis. The result of classification using this technique is providing a very accurate classification of weld defect.},

abstract={Artificial neural networks are widely used in medical diagnosis replacing most of the conventional diagnosis methods due to its accuracy and speed. This paper analyses the variation in the accuracy of diagnosis of type II diabetes using Artificial Neural Networks based on the accuracy of the inputs given to the network. It compares the efficiency of the network based on the input format. The data needed for this comparison is collected by interviewing patients who approach the diabetician with various symptoms of the disease. These symptoms can be modeled in 2 different forms. One form just specifies the presence or absence of the symptom and can be represented using Boolean values. The other form specifies the severity or frequency of occurrence of the symptom. Both these inputs are given to the system and the accuracy of the output is analyzed. This result indicates the impact of the specification of the input on the output. Comparison is done by performing regression analysis on both the outputs. Regression analysis gives the correlation between the output of the system and the target [1]. It makes use of only the most general symptoms of the disease. Further analysis can be done on other diabetes particular symptoms.},

abstract={Microbial enzymes meet industrial demands. Over 60% of the total Phosphorus in cereal grains and oil seeds as well as their by-products is found as phytate, myo-inositol hexakisphosphate. Phytases are a group of enzymes that initiate the phosphate hydrolysis from phytate and produce myo-inositol and inorganic phosphate by catalyzing the stepwise removal of the phosphate groups. Microbial phytases effectively improve dietary phytate-P utilization. Extracellular phytase produced by Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6051 was purified by acetone precipitation, DEAE- sepharose and phenylsepharose column chromatographies. The molecular weight of the enzyme was estimated to be 48 kDa on gel filtration and 43kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Its optimum pH and temperature for phytase activity were pH 6.2 to 8.2 and 40°C without 10mM CaCl2 and pH 6.5 to 9.5 and 60° with 10mM CaCl2. The enzyme activity was stable from pH 6.5to 10. The enzyme had an isoelectric point of 6.8. It was very specific for sodium phytate. The Km value for sodium phytate was 50μM. Its activity was inhibited by EDTA and metal ions such as Mn2+,Hg2+,Cu2+,Cr3+, Co2+,Ba2+and Cd2+ions. The enzyme has great potential in food industry, probiotics, animal feed supplement and transgenic crops.},

The dipole moment of the cluster depends upon the asymmetry of the atoms in the structure. The HOMO-LUMO gap, electron affinity, ionization potential and stability factor of different isomers for these different structures are also compared and studied. From the observed studies it is found that the electronic and chemical properties are influenced by the electron affinity and HOMO-LUMO gap.

abstract={A forced convection solar drier is designed with evacuated tube collector and a blower. The performance of the designed drier is evaluated by carrying drying experiments at Thanjavur District, Tamilnadu, India with amla. Solar drying of amla is carried at different air velocity flow rates - 4m/s, 4.25m/s and 4.5m/s and is compared with natural sun drying. The temperature of the drying chamber ranges from 53°C to 82°C while the ambient temperature ranges from 29°C to 32°C. The efficiency of the designed drier varies from 38.61% to 43.7% where as the efficiency of sun drying varies from 12.5% to 14.15%. It is observed that the efficiency of the drier increases with increase in air velocity flow rates. Initial moisture content of amla ranges between 83.6% and 84.3% and the equilibrium moisture content ranges between 0.1% and 0.6%. Solar drying takes 5 to 7 hours to reach safe moisture content where as sun drying takes 13 to15 hours. Also the quality of solar dried amla is better in terms of colour, odour, flavour and appearance than the sun dried amla. The observed result of the present work shows that the proposed solar drier is good for drying amla in this region.},

abstract={In recent years heavy metal pollution has become one of the most serious threats to crop yield. Decontamination of heavy metals from agricultural soil and water polluted with industrial effluents that carry them has become an urgent need to ensure stable crop yields. The use of phyto-based bio-sorbents for the removal of such heavy metals would provide both a cost-effective and eco-friendly solution. Although many researches have elucidated the potential of roots of vetiver [Vetiveria zizanioides (L.) Nash] as an effective bio-sorbent for one such heavy metal - lead, an effort has been taken in the present study to further understand the influence of time and competition from other co-metal ions on the mechanism of biosorption of lead by treating with two compositionally differing solutions containing lead. The lead adsorption capacity of biosorbent, treated with both samples at various time intervals was determined using atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The results showed that the rate of biosorption of lead from underground water used for irrigation showed a negative trend with temporal variations, whereas in pure lead solution the influence of time on the biosorption rate showed a positively increasing pattern. The effect of contact time on the biosorption of lead and the mechanism of lead uptake was investigated in both samples. It was observed that the difference in composition of the samples influences the biosorption process. The mass transfer studies for the biosorption of lead in both samples was also undertaken and the mechanism involved in the adsorption process was identified by fitting an intraparticle diffusion plot.},

abstract={The causative agents of skin infection are bacteria, fungi and in specific dermatophytes. Many infectious diseases have been treated with plant extracts. The free and bound flavonoids fractions of Wrightia tinctoria (Roxb) R.Br. (Apocynaceae), leaves were tested against 10 bacterial, 3 fungal and 4 dermatophytic strains affecting the skin using disc diffusion and broth micro dilution method. The free flavonoidal extract showed maximum activity against Bacillus subtilis (gram positive), Proteus vulgaris (gram negative), Candida albicans (fungus) and Trichophyton rubrum (dermatophyte). The bound flavonoidal extract showed maximum activity against Staphylococcus aureus (gram positive), Escherichia coli (gram negative), Candida albicans (fungus) and Epidermophyton floccosum (dermatophytes) among the various tested organisms. The bounded flavonoidal extract (activity index 0.58) had strong activity against dermatophytes. This provides a lead that, flavonoidal extract could be used for direct incorporation into formulations for effective treatment and a scientific rationale for the traditional use of Wrightia tinctoria in treating skin infections.},

abstract={The study was aimed to find out the impact of glucose on the expression of deleted in colon cancer (DCC) and Wilson tumour (WT1), tumour marker genes, in liver cancer cells and normal kidney cells. Liver cancer cell lines HepG2, Hep3B, HCCM, Huh 7, PLC5, and normal kidney cell lines MDCK and HEK 293 were grown in a medium containing two different concentration of glucose. Crystal violet assay was performed to determine the colony forming ability of the liver cancer cells and it was found to be decreased in cells grown in lower concentration of glucose. Expression level of DCC and WT1 was determined by RT-PCR with specific primer for the genes from the total RNA of liver and kidney cells grown in media with lower and higher glucose concentration. Our results showed that the cells grown in lower concentration of glucose showed reduced expression of the marker genes as compared with the cells grown in higher concentration of glucose. Furthermore, this study identified that glucose plays a vital role in the growth of some of these liver cancer cells and normal kidney cells. Interrupting the supply of glucose in cancer cells may be an appealing therapeutic strategy for cancer.},

abstract={Chromium (III) oxide (Cr2O3)-doped LaSrFeO 3 perovskite, La0.2Sr0.8Fe0.8Cr 0.2O3-δ (LSFCO), is being considered as a potential material for applications in solid oxide fuel cells, gas separation membranes, and electrochemical reactors because of its high electro-catalytic activity. Similar to other perovskites, the performance and mechanical strength of LSFCO materials are significantly affected by environment and temperature. Here, we report a fracture gradient phenomenon in tubular C-ring-shaped LSFCO ceramic membranes under graded reducing conditions. The graded reducing condition was produced by flushing N2 on the outer side of the C-ring membranes at 1000 °C while keeping the inner side untreated. The rings were then diametrically compressed to fracture, and the resultant fracture morphology was analyzed with a scanning electron microscope (SEM). A fracture gradient with three distinct regions across the thickness of the membranes was identified on the split surfaces. In the outer region of the C-ring specimen exposed to N 2, a mixed inter/transgranular fracture with a predominant intergranular pattern was observed. In the middle section of the fracture surface, a characteristic transgranular fracture of the perovskite grains was found. At the inner region of the ring, a mixed inter/transgranular fracture with a predominant transgranular pattern occurred. The mechanism of gradient fractures was attributed both to chemically induced stresses caused by oxygen diffusion and to the formation of a separate phase of oxygen-deficient perovskite in the parent perovskite. The stresses generated were modeled by a point defect model. This work provides significant information on microstructure evolutions of tubular LSFCO membranes under graded reducing atmospheres. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Background &amp; objectives: The complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) have not been systematically evaluated for the management of HIV/AIDS patients. In a prospective, single-site, open- label, non-randomized, controlled, pilot trial, we evaluated a polyherbal formulation (PHF) for its safety and efficacy in treating subjects with HIV-AIDS. Methods: A total of 32 and 31 subjects were enrolled under the PHF and highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) arms, respectively, and followed up for a period of 24 months. Plasma viral RNA, CD4 cell count and blood chemistry were monitored at 3-month intervals. Following mid-term safety evaluation, 12 subjects from the PHF arm were shifted to HAART and were followed separately as PHF- to-HAART arm, for the rest of the period. Results: The HAART arm was characterized by significant improvements in CD4 cell count (154.4 cells/μl/year, P&lt;0.001) and reduction in plasma viral load within 3 to 6 months (-0.431± 0.004 log10 IU/month, P&lt;0.001). In contrast, the PHF arm showed a profile of CD4 cell loss at remarkably slower kinetics (14.3 cells/μl/year, P=0.021) and insignificant reduction in the viral load. The PHF and HAART arms did not differ significantly in the occurrence of AIDS-related illnesses over the study period of 24 months. In the PHF-to-HAART arm, the rates of CD4 count and reduction in viral load were significant and comparable to that of the HAART group. In the PHF arm, at 1 month, a significant increase in CD4 cell count and a concomitant decrease in viral load were seen. Interpretation &amp; conclusions: The PHF appears to have provided protection by delaying the kinetics of CD4 cell reduction. Given the several study limitations, drawing assertive inferences from the data is challenging. Future studies with a stringent study design are warranted to confirm these findings.},

abstract={Thermally stable/high-performance polymers are able to provide long-term service at elevated temperatures. The development of different thermally stable polymers is continued due to the large requirement of high-temperature polymers. Polyimides (PI) and their copolyimides are well-established class of high-performance polymers that show good combination of thermal, mechanical, and electrical properties. These stable PI are widely used in electrical, electronics, automotive, and aerospace industries. This article reviews the synthesis and characterization of AB-type monomers, AB-type PI, and copolyimides having different structures. AB-type PI are synthesized by self-condensation of AB-type monomers. The requirement of stoichiometric equivalence to obtain high-molecular-weight polyimide will be easily met by using AB-type monomers. This discussion covers different structures of AB-type monomers based PI and their properties. The variations in the structure of the monomers have effect on the properties of the final PI. The structure-property relationships also have been discussed. Copyright © 2012 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={The effect of molecular shape and position of hydrogen bonding functionality in the solid state structural self-assembly was investigated using diaminotriazine substituted diphenyl ether based positional isomers (1-5). The molecular shape was modulated by changing diaminotriazine position that produced channel supramolecular structures in 1, 3 and 5. There exists a direct correlation between the molecular shape and three dimensional structures; more linear molecules resulted in close-packing whereas molecules with a labyrinthine topology formed a channel structure. Supramolecular aspects pertaining to the influence of solvent of crystallization in structure formation and reversible structural transformation in solid state were also explored. 1-5 exhibited tunable solid state fluorescence (λmax = 437-496 nm) depending on the diaminotriazine substitutional position and 3 showed solvent-dependent solid state fluorescence. The present study describes the generation of a supramolecular channel structure with functional properties such as tunable fluorescence by varying the position of hydrogen bond functionality and solvent of crystallization. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={Ayurveda and siddha are the ancient medicinal system that uses herbs as potential therapeutic agent but mainly suffer with limitations of inaccuracy in dose, less quality control standards, unacceptable odour and taste, type of dosage form, difficulty in administration and poor patient acceptance. The present paper involves the amendment of a new dosage form for improving the therapy of poly herbal formulation, and in this work Thirikadugu Chooranam and Nilavembu Kudineer Chooranam has been selected as models. These choornas are usually prescribed in the form of kashayam and kudineer (1 - 2 gm as hot water decoction twice a day), respectively in Siddha system of medicine. The inappropriate dose and dosing schedule, difficulty in preparation of the kashayam, bitter taste necessitates the development of a solid dosage form. But the direct conversion of choorana powder into tablets / capsules reduces the solubility of the active components, which actually need to be given as a solubilised extract. So, Modified Liquisolid Compaction technique is adapted her where the aqueous or hydro-alcoholic extract (kashayam or decoction) is prepared from the powder and concentrated to low liquid content, which is then converted into free flowing powder by the addition of inert carriers such as microcrystalline cellulose, silicon dioxide and lactose, followed by compression of the mass as compact discs. The liquisolid compact of the formulated Chooranam was studied for different quality control parameters.},

abstract={Nanostructured ZnO thin films were deposited on glass substrates at 503 K using spray pyrolysis technique and the films were post annealed at 673 K in air atmosphere for 3 h. The structural, morphological and optical properties of as-deposited and annealed samples were investigated. The annealed films showed uniform spherical morphology in contrast with as-deposited films. XRD patterns of both the annealed and as-deposited films confirmed the polycrystalline nature of the films with hexagonal wurtzite structure. Room temperature ammonia sensing characteristics of annealed films were studied for various concentration levels of ammonia at dry air and humidity conditions. A highest room temperature response of 233 was achieved at 25 ppm of NH3 with a response and recovery times of 20 and 25 s respectively. The response of the sensor to other gases such as methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol, benzyl alcohol and acetone indicated a high selectivity towards ammonia gas. The room temperature (303 K) operation, with high selectivity, repeatability and fast transition times of the sensor together with the low deposition cost suggests suitability for developing a low power cost-effective ammonia sensor. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Since many years, it is traditionally used in the effective management of liver and spleen diseases, ascites etc. To do a comparative study of Arka lavana prepared employing traditional and modern methods. Arka lavana was prepared in two different methods viz., Traditional puta method and the Modern muffle furnace method and named as Arka lavana-A and Arka lavana-B respectively. The formulations thus prepared were analyzed with standard parameters like physicochemical characterization. Arka lavana was characterized using FT-IR spectroscopy, Particle size analyzer, Zeta sizer, TG-DTA and X- ray Fluorescence spectroscopy. Sodium and Chloride content was 52.09%, 22.40% and 49.37%, 22.91% in Arka lavana-A and B respectively. Though Arka lavana-A prepared by employing traditional puta method, was matching with Ayurvedic Pharmacopeia of India, based on the parameters of analysis, it is difficult to conclude that Traditional puta method is best method than the Modern muffle furnace method.},

abstract={This study has investigated the effect of milling in increasing the solubility of a poorly soluble drug Nimesulide. Nimesulide was subjected to ball milling in the presence of a natural polymer, β-Cyclodextrin and a synthetic polymer, Poly ethylene glycol (PEG) 6000. The physical dispersions of the drug with each polymer were taken in three different ratios of 1:1, 1:3, 1:5 respectively and milled at time intervals of 30 min and 90 min individually. Before and after milling the physical dispersions and the pure drug were subjected to various evaluation parameters like solubility, particle size analysis and flow property. The milled physical dispersions showed a better flow property and solubility (153μg/ml) than the nonmilled dispersions. The milled physical dispersions were developed into tablet and capsule dosage form and evaluated for thickness, diameter, hardness (2-4Kg/cm 2), weight variation (109-321 mg), disintegration time (8-20 min), drug content (95-101%) and dissolution rates. Modifications in the solid state were observed by various characterization techniques with the help of Fourier Transform Infra Red Spectroscopy (FTIR), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) shows changes in melting point, and X-Ray Diffractometry (XRD) reveals reduction in crystalinity. The data obtained showed an increase in the dissolution rates of the ball milled dispersions with increase in time of milling and at higher concentration of the polymers (above 90% at 1:5 ratio).},

The focal point of this paper is Privacy preserving in cloud computing. This paper analyses and discusses various methods like adopting cryptographic methods, writing access rights and policies, anonymising data, segregating or fragmenting and then reconstructing the data, etc. All these approaches would preserve the privacy of user and data and while performing public auditing on the cloud data. The surveyed approaches are showcased and compared with one another, stating their pros and cons. Finally, the results are centralized and the issues to be concentrated in the future are drawn out. Enabling complete user control over his data, anonymising or encrypting the sensitive data before outsourcing, notifying the data owner upon data access, altogether with the tied up security mechanisms would nullify the privacy issue. This would serve as a helping note in the progress of strengthening the privacy preserving approaches in Cloud Computing.},

abstract={Safety measures and uninterrupted surveillance are essential in areas like bank safety locker room, defense systems, VIP's homes and Luxury hotels. Prison is also the place where there is a need for high security and severe surveillance system. There are several techniques used in these particular environments which include the traditional VHS (Video Home System) and DVR (Digital Video Recorder) system.VHS surveillance system usually has the video quality problem of displaying because the analog signal is directly sent to monitor without processing, which results in poor monitoring system. Instead the DVR demonstrates a better competence in the prison. The main objective of this work is to introduce the application of CCMS (Central Control and Monitoring System) with 3G technologies for prison management by using the low cost and low power sensors through the web or wireless network which reduces the manual work involved. It also reduces the money invested and power usage in providing electrical fencing in the prison. The use of motion detection sensors and additional digital I/O devices helps to prevent escapes of prisoners.},

Trajectory structures stored at every 25 ps (2000 structures) were probed at molecular (RMSD and radius of gyration) and residue (RMSF, surface area accessibility and secondary structures) level resolutions by means of various computational strategies. Comprehensive analysis of the data suggested that the C-terminal tail of the protein, which is sandwiched in the cleft region, was first destabilized followed by double-stranded domain and strand IV of triple-stranded domain of the protein. Strikingly, it was found that the protein assumed a partially structured state consisting of a sheet composed of stand III and V at around 16 ns and the intermediate was also found to be stable in the rest of the dynamic scales at 473 K. The structural features of the partially structured intermediate and its implications on understanding the stability and folding dynamics of the protein have been brought into fore in detail.},

abstract={Gout is an abnormality in the body resulting in the accumulation of uric acid mainly in joints. Dissolution of uric acid crystals into soluble allantoin by the enzyme uricase might provide a better alternative for the treatment of gout. This work aims to investigate the feasibility of a transdermal patch loaded with uricase for better patient compliance. Mesoporous silica (SBA-15) was chosen as the matrix for immobilisation of uricase. Highly oriented mesoporous SBA-15 was synthesized, characterized and uricase was physisorbed in the mesoporous material. The percentage adsorption and release of enzyme in borate buffer was monitored. The release followed linear kinetics and greater than 80% enzyme activity was retained indicating the potential of this system as an effective enzyme immobilization matrix. The enzyme permeability was studied with wistar rat skin and human cadaver skin. It was found that in case of untreated rat skin 10% of enzyme permeated through skin in 100 h. The permeation increased by adding permeation enhancer (combination of oleic acid in propylene glycol (OA in PG)). The permeation enhancement was studied under two concentrations of OA in PG (1%, 5%) in both rat and human cadaver skin and it was found that 1% OA in PG showed better result in rat skin and 5% OA in PG showed good results in human cadaver skin.

abstract={Soft computing techniques like neural networks are popular in the field of oceanography. To obtain the spectrum of oceanic parameters particularly the ocean wave heights are selected for the coastal regions of Tamil Nadu. The paper maintains keenness in applying the computer knowledge to ocean's welfare. The data sets are trained, based on the actual wave periods and heights. Such effort of measuring is achieved with the calibration of the tonal variation and the predicted wave table with the actual measurements and assess the error corrections to the predicted wave table with the actual measurements of the sea coast. This data is required to the planners of offshore structures, boat authorities, navigators, fisherman and the engineers producing oil from the offshore platforms. Once the training set is obtained, it is verified with actual height and necessary pruning has been introduced after that. The predicted and actual values of wave height reached, the inferred profile and the different stages applied are kept as reference block, by applying the root mean square corrections the data has been validated. A tolerance level of 7 to 10 percent error is envisaged in the measurements. The model is found successful. © 2013 IEEE.},

Cloud data storage is a technology that uses the internet and central remote servers to maintain data and share the applications. It allows consumer to use applications without installation and access their personal files at any computer with internet access. In general data property analysis system, Source and destination file content is compared in the form of bytes. In the cloud environment, data verification is needed for every computation in the storage correctness. So every time the data is retrieved from local system and compared with the destination file from the cloud zone. This procedure takes too much of time to find out a tiny change in the cloud file content. The proposed system is implemented with the idea of checking the file properties to find out the change in file content instead of verifying the entire file content. To check properties we have taken some of the file attributes such as file size, file modification date, file name and location. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Cognitive Radio having the great key mechanism of enabling spectrum awareness in the Spectrum sensing. This paper deals with spectrum sensing methods used in a cognitive radio is presented and also deals disadvantages and advantages facing each sensing method. Cognitive radio facing many feature difficulties in spectrum sensing and those are measured by multi-dimensional spectrum sensing. Those tasks are enabling and revised these spectrum sensing approaches. Other alternative methods like Statistical sensing algorithms also discussed here. Moreover, statistical modelling of network utilization and also traffic models are used for estimation of primary user performance. Spectrum sensing uses dynamic spectrum model without troubling the primary users. This may improves the radio frequency usage of spectrum and it is done when both unlicensed and licensed reducing interference and also by usage of licensed users for identifying the white spaces. The concurrence of these circumstances can produce a commands where the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is below the level of detection threshold by use of sensor, and it missed detections at final result. The concept spectrum sensing is important to secondary users in cognitive radio to operate without interfering the primary users. Final review shows cooperative sensing spectrum can improve the performance of cognitive radio network by increasing the efficiency spectrum and providing a detection accuracy better. These benefits come at the cost of increased traffic overhead, complexity, power consumption, and the need for control channels. The idea of cognitive radio is planned to address the issue faced in spectrum efficiency and it provides wireless users to adapt their operating factors and dealings with the help of adjacent radio environment. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Phase reversal quasi-phase matching devices are fairly capable of yielding a dual peak second harmonic spectral response. However, it does suffer from uneven intensity and overlapping of the peaks. In this paper, we analyze the effect of the errors to which these devices are prone. Such unavoidable errors are bound to happen during the poling process even under controlled conditions. The second harmonic spectral response is analyzed by introducing two sorts of possible errors in an ideal phase reversal quasi-phase matching device. Initially, the aperiodic domain is kept fixed at the center of the device and its width is altered to determine the intensity variation of the peaks. When the width of the aperiodic domain is not equal to twice the periodic domain width, an unequal peak response is observed. Secondly, the aperiodic domain width is kept constant while the aperiodic domain is moved along the length of the device to determine the interference between the peaks. If the aperiodic domain is not positioned exactly at the center, a disturbance of the peaks' intensities is noticed. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The major causes for cataract formation are free radicals, and these free radicals are neutralized by the presence of endogenous antioxidants in the eye. Using xenobiotics, it has been confirmed that free radicals mediate the formation of cataract. Two cataract model-selenite model and the diabetic cataract model-have been developed to study the pathophysiology of cataract formation due to free radicals and the role of antioxidants during the process of cataractogenesis. This review focuses on natural compounds with antioxidant properties that could actually be applied as an interventional strategy on a large scale and are also relatively inexpensive. A brief overview of plants with antioxidant properties that in addition possess potential anti-cataract properties has been discussed. In addition to plants, three natural compounds (curcumin, vitamin C and vitamin E), on which a lot of data exist showing anti-cataract and antioxidant activities, have also been discussed. These antioxidants can be supplemented in the diet for a better defence against free radicals. Studies on vitamin C and vitamin E have proved that they are capable of preventing lipid peroxidation, thereby preventing the generation of free radicals, but their efficacy as anti-cataract agent is questionable. Unlike vitamins C and E, curcumin is well established as an anti-cataract agent, but the issue of curcumin bioavailability is yet to be addressed. Nanotechnology proves to be a promising area in increasing the curcumin bioavailability, but still a lot more research needs to be done before the use of curcumin as an effective anti-cataract agent for humans. © 2013 Informa UK, Ltd.},

abstract={Tissue engineering requires an ideal scaffold that will aid in the regeneration of the damaged tissues both structurally and functionally. Conventionally, polymeric nanofibrous scaffolds have been extensively used due to their structural similarity to the native extracellular matrix. Thus far, top-down approaches like electrospinning and phase separation have been predominantly used for the nanofiber fabrication. Recently, self-assembling peptide nanofibers (SAPNF) have been identified as promising scaffolds for tissue engineering applications. Molecular self-assembly of peptides, which is a bottom-up approach has laid foundations for the development of such novel scaffolds. Designer self-assembling peptides provide functional support as well as bio-recognition due to the presence of bioactive motifs embedded in them. However, there are certain limitations to both electrospun and SAPNF scaffolds in terms of synthesis, cues presented to the biological system and applications. Design of composite, hybrid scaffolds by super-positioning possible cues may result in effective functional tissue regeneration at multiple levels. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={The investigation of chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of cancer since the early 1940s has resulted in the discovery of over 50 drugs till date. However, most of these drugs result in severe side effects causing physical and mental trauma to patients. In order to eliminate the side effects, search for better and safer drugs has been ongoing for several decades, which has resulted in the discovery of anti-cancer properties of many phytochemicals. Polyphenols represent a unique class of phytochemicals that possess excellent anti- oxidant, anti-inflammatory properties and also modulate cell signalling pathways leading to anti-cancer effects. However, the use of these compounds as anti-cancer agents is not as effective and hence combinations of chemotherapeutic drugs with these molecules have been attempted. Promising results in vitro and in vivo experiments while using combinations of polyphenols and chemotherapeutic agents open up new avenues for the discovery of the ideal drug combinations for cancer therapy. This review highlights the efficacy of the combination of phytochemicals with synthetic anti-neoplastic drugs over the conventional combinations of anti-neoplastic drugs and the possible interventions in the clinical settings. The review also discusses the inclusion of polyphenols in emerging therapeutic modalities like nanotechnology and photodynamic therapy. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={Ras genes are pre-eminent genes that are frequently linked with cancer biology. The functional loss of ras protein caused by various point mutations within the gene, is established as a prognostic factor for the genesis of a constitutively active Ras-MAPK pathway leading to cancer. Ras signaling circuit follows a complex pathway, which connects many signaling molecules and cells. Several strategies have come up for targeting mutant ras proteins for cancer therapy, however, the clinical benefits remain insignificant. Targeting the Ras-MAPK pathway is extremely complicated due its intricate networks involving several upstream and downstream regulators. Blocking oncogenic Ras is still in latent stage and requires alternative approaches to screen the genes involved in Ras transformation. Understanding the mechanism of Ras induced tumorigenesis in diverse cancers and signaling networks will open a path for drug development and other therapeutic approaches. © 2013 Versita Warsaw and Springer-Verlag Wien.},

abstract={To tackle "Broadband" applications, high spectral efficiency is the foremost requirement in any wireless domain. Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) promises to be the solution for transmitting and maintaining large amount of data with a high data rate. High Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) is the challenging issue with OFDM system. Partial Transmit Sequence (PTS) algorithm is utilized in OFDM system which provides low PAPR and mitigates the out of band radiation in OFDM system. Hence, in this study, a Simulink model of OFDM was built using PTS algorithm to reduce the PAPR. Comparison analysis was carried out for different sub carrier values adopting various modulation schemes and from the graphs plotted, it was observed that there was a reduction in the PAPR value with the increase in the number of sub carriers. © 2013 Academic Journals Inc.},

abstract={Robots that assist and interact with humans will inevitably require to successfully achieve the task of handing over objects. Whether it is to deliver desired objects for the elderly living in their homes or hand tools to a worker in a factory, the process of robot hand-overs is one worthy study within the human robot interaction community. While the study of object hand-overs have been studied in previous works [1], these works have mainly considered anthropomorphic robots, that is, robots that appear and move similar to humans. However, recent trends within robotics, and in particular domestic robotics have witnessed an increase in non-anthropomorphic robotic platforms such as moving tables [2], teleconferencing robots [3] and vacuum cleaners. The study of robot hand-over for non-anthropomorphic robots and in particular the study of what constitute a successful hand-over is at focus in this paper.

abstract={Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disease affecting millions of people worldwide. The proteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein forms amyloid beta peptide (Aβ1-42), which aggregates to form senile plaques. The KLVFF motif present in Aβ1-42 is essential for aggregation. Curcumin, a prinicipal curcuminoid present in turmeric, shows therapeutic activity against Alzheimer's disease. However, the nature of interaction between the Aβ1-42 peptide and curcumin remains unexplored. Studies on the interaction of the core-recognition motif KLVFF with curcumin can be extrapolated to decipher the interactions between Aβ1-42 and curcumin. Our data show that curcumin and KLVFF interact strongly through hydrophobic forces and are stabilized by hydrogen bonding. The hydrophobic interactions were confirmed from the positive shift in the phase transition temperature. Fluorescence quenching studies demonstrate a static quenching mechanism. FTIR data confirm the β sheet breaking ability of curcumin, which is also substantiated by cell culture studies. © 2013 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Staphylococcus aureus is extensively acknowledged as an opportunistic pathogen because of acquisition and rapid spread of resistance to antibiotics. The temporal expression of many virulence genes is controlled by a major regulatory molecule, SarA that binds to the promoter region of target genes. Constitutive activation of the SarA proteins plays a critical role in the biofilm formation and proliferation of S. aureus. The investigation of SarA inhibitors as potential therapeutic agents is based on the fact that the highly conserved winged region participates in DNA binding and activation is expressed in various staphylococcal species. Computer-assisted drug design was employed to generate first specific low molecular weight compounds that interact with SarA and disrupt the quorum-sensing mechanism. Thirteen potential inhibitors of SarA are identified to improve the understanding of SarA biological function and to disclose future strategies for inhibition. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Medicinal plants are the local heritage with universal importance. World is gifted with a rich wealth of medicinal plants. Herbs have always been the principal source of medicine in India and presently they are becoming popular throughout the world. But the major lacuna is the lack of proper identification and information about the medicinal plants. This is mainly because due to the fact that there exist many single drugs under one name or one drug is used in different names. Many Botanical sources are equated for one single drug and the drug becomes a controversial drug and many such drugs exist in Indian systems of medicine. 'Sivanarvembu' is one such drug of doubtful origin in Siddha system of medicine. 'Justicia tranquebariensis L.' belonging to the family Acanthaceae one of the sources of sivanarvembu is reviewed from ethnopharmacognostic view and presented in this paper. In Tamil it is called as "Tavashoo moorunghie" or "Poonakapoondo". The present paper deals with the literature available on the ethno botanical, pharmacognostic, phytochemical and pharmacological studies on 'Justicia tranquebariensis L.'. This present review can help in detecting the selected drug from other sources of 'Sivanarvembu' and will also scientifically help in justifying its usage as 'Sivanarvembu'.},

abstract={Fried food products have unique organoleptic and sensorial properties, including flavor, texture and appearance largely enjoyed by the customer. The high temperatures used during frying, in the presence of oxygen, induce chemical changes of the oils inevitably reducing their shelf life and affecting the quality of the fried food. Thermal degradation of edible oils occurs in three stages, related to the decomposition of polyunsaturated, monounsaturated and saturated fatty acids. In this work kinematic viscosity is measured for heated and unheated palm oil using Redwood viscometer. The oil is studied by heating it four cycles to frying condition and the variation of viscosity is measured from 30°C to 90 °C and it is noted that r square value ranges from 0.986 to 0.995 for the dependable parameter viscosity. The oxidative deterioration of the oils heated to 210°C for 0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2 hours is also studied. FTIR spectroscopy is used to non-invasively measure the degradation of frying oil caused by heating. It is an effective tool for the determination of the degree of saturation of heated and unheated palm oil.},

This paper discusses the study of FPGA utilization when scheduling fixed size configurable computation hardware block (CCHB) by applying a heuristic. Based on the parameters (speedup, CCHB size etc.,) associated with the independent CCHBs, scheduling is performed and it is repeated for various sizes of FPGA. From the study of four applications from benchmark suite, it is observed that the device utilization is increased with size of CCHBs not greater than 0.5 times or not less than 0.85 times of the size of FPGA.},

abstract={Cloud Computing is an environment for providing information and resources that are delivered as a service to end-users over the Internet on demand. Thus cloud enables users to access their data from any geographical locations at any time and also has brought benefits in the form of online storage services. Cloud storage service avoids the cost expensive on software, personnel maintenance and provides better performance, less storage cost and scalability. But the maintenance of stored data in a secure manner is not an easy task in cloud environment and especially that stored data may not be completely trustworthy. Cloud delivers services through internet which increases their exposure to storage security vulnerabilities. However security is one of the major drawbacks that preventing several large organizations to enter into cloud computing environment. This work surveyed on several existing cloud storage frameworks, techniques and their advantages, drawbacks and also discusses the challenges that are required to implement secure cloud data storage. This survey results help to identify the future research areas and methods for improving the existing drawbacks.},

Current systems implementing multi biometric scheme remain unsatisfactory facing to the growing security needs. The proposed system provides secured authentication to integrate multi biometric system with Elliptic Curve Cryptography that employs two modalities (i) Fusion of fingerprint, face, iris and signature. (ii) Generating elliptic curve and key using Elliptic Curve Cryptography. In the proposed system, selected portion of multi biometric features are fused into a single image and a curve is generated using ECC based technique that employs secured domain parameters generated through Genetic Algorithm. A one time password is also appended to the system to afford high authentication. The proposed algorithm is highly efficient against False Acceptance Rate and False Rejection Rate.},

The data from the methods were examined by a 'strong residue contacts' filter strategy and the data analyses of the former and latter methods identified 10 (Q52, K57, S60, L63, K64, R65, G67, D68, D71 & S72) and 3 (S60, E61 & K64) crucial residues of the hBaxBH3 peptide for interacting with the protein, respectively. We have herein demonstrated that BH3-chemical mimetics screened using the pharmacophoric residues of hBaxBH3 obtained from the 'peptidodynmimetic method' were superior in terms of ligand efficiencies, bioavailability and pharmacokinetic properties vis-à-vis that of small molecule BH3-mimetics retrieved using the conventional 'peptidomimetic method'.

abstract={Radiographic images are generally of high volume. These images when stored occupy a lot of storage space and the transmission of them is also difficult due their large size. So reduction of size plays an important role in storage and transmission of images. To achieve this reduction, compression techniques are being widely used. This paper focuses on the process of welding, Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG) welding in specific, the generation and development of photographic film of weldments and also a novel method is presented, which is intended to reduce the size of the radiographic image developed, by applying lossless compression technique on the crucial regions of the image. The crucial regions of the image are automatically detected by using segmentation technique in the proposed method. After the detection of crucial regions, lossless compression technique is applied on them. The compressed data obtained along with some information of the image is transmitted to the other validated user for reconstruction of the original image. Apparently, the original image data can't be understood by the third party during transmission, which makes this method to be used for secure transmission of data. The image reconstructed by this method will not have any loss of data in the crucial regions of the image but certain loss is present in the non-crucial regions. This method is tested on some images and their results are shown in the paper along with the compression rates. The results are also compared with other methods. © 2013 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.},

abstract={The major concern in medical fields especially to the doctor is getting the right diagnosis, classification and ultimately the right treatment. Diabetes is serious health problem in both developing and industrial countries especially in India and its incidence is increasing. Artificial neural network provides a powerful tool to help the medical professionals to clinically analyze the disease and get the best solutions. The aim of the present paper is to make best use of Associative Neural network in classification of diabetes into five classes (normal, mild, moderate, severe and chronic). The ASNN(Associative Neural Net work) is configured with 11 neurons in the input layer, 8 neurons in the hidden layer and 1 neuron in the output layer. The network is trained with 100 data sets. The trained ASNN network is used for testing. The result of this study shows that ASNN provides satisfactory results for the diabetic diagnosis and classification. The developed ASNN displays a high percentage of classification accuracy (94%) and excellent correlation (R2 = 0.981). The results are cross -validated by Leave - One - Out (LOO) procedure. This model is helpful to the doctors as using this model they can decide the type of treatment, dosage of medicines depending upon the classifications.},

abstract={Non Destructive Evaluation (NDE) is a technique to detect the defects without affecting the intended application or the structure, which is mainly used for damage assessment and quality control. NDE is basically used for automation of defect quantification. This paper presents a method for weld defect detection using iterative method for image reconstruction. Image reconstruction is a technique of reconstructing the image of object from the radon transform of the object, where radon transform is obtained by passing an energy source through the object in various angles and collecting the projected data on a detector. Weld defects such as slag inclusion, lack of penetration, and burn through can cause serious disaster if it is undetected at the time of weld process. The system of linear equation under consideration in Computed Tomography (CT) are basically very large in size, so the direct method takes too much of computational time which makes it impractical for implementation. Cimmino's method and Simultaneous Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (SART) are iterative methodologies for image reconstruction which are best suited for solving large scale linear system where direct method fails due to very large time consumption. This paper compares the experimental results of image reconstruction of weld defect radiographic images using SART and Cimmino's method for various test images with varying number of projections.},

abstract={Multidrug-resistant Salmonella serovars have been a recent concern in curing infectious diseases like typhoid. Salmonella BaeS and BaeR are the two-component system (TCS) that signal transduction proteins found to play an important role in its multidrug resistance. A canonical TCS comprises a histidine kinase (HK) and its cognate partner response regulator (RR). The general approaches for therapeutic targeting are either the catalytic ATP-binding domain or the dimerization domain HisKA (DHp) of the HK, and in some cases, the receiver or the regulatory domain of the RR proteins. Earlier efforts of identifying novel drugs targeting the signal transduction protein have not been quite successful, as it shares similar ATP-binding domain with the key house keeping gene products of the mammalian GHL family. However, targeting the dimerization domain of HisKA through which the signals are received from the RR can be a better approach. In this article, we show stepwise procedure to specifically identify the key interacting residues involved in the dimerization with the RR along with effective targeting by ligands screened from the public database. We have found a few inhibitors which target effectively the important residues for the dimerization activity. Our results suggest a plausible de novo design of better DHp domain inhibitors. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={The stability of thermophilic proteins has been viewed from different perspectives and there is yet no unified principle to understand this stability. It would be valuable to reveal the most important interactions for designing thermostable proteins for such applications as industrial protein engineering. In this work, we have systematically analyzed the importance of various interactions by computing different parameters such as surrounding hydrophobicity, inter-residue interactions, ion-pairs and hydrogen bonds. The importance of each interaction has been determined by its predicted relative contribution in thermophiles versus the same contribution in mesophilic homologues based on a dataset of 373 protein families. We predict that hydrophobic environment is the major factor for the stability of thermophilic proteins and found that 80% of thermophilic proteins analyzed showed higher hydrophobicity than their mesophilic counterparts. Ion pairs, hydrogen bonds, and interaction energy are also important and favored in 68%, 50%, and 62% of thermophilic proteins, respectively. Interestingly, thermophilic proteins with decreased hydrophobic environments display a greater number of hydrogen bonds and/or ion pairs. The systematic elimination of mesophilic proteins based on surrounding hydrophobicity, interaction energy, and ion pairs/hydrogen bonds, led to correctly identifying 95% of the thermophilic proteins in our analyses. Our analysis was also applied to another, more refined set of 102 thermophilic-mesophilic pairs, which again identified hydrophobicity as a dominant property in 71% of the thermophilic proteins. Further, the notion of surrounding hydrophobicity, which characterizes the hydrophobic behavior of residues in a protein environment, has been applied to the three-dimensional structures of elongation factor-Tu proteins and we found that the thermophilic proteins are enriched with a hydrophobic environment. The results obtained in this work highlight the importance of hydrophobicity as the dominating characteristic in the stability of thermophilic proteins, and we anticipate this will be useful in our attempts to engineering thermostable proteins. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

In wireless communication the multipath effect produce interference and also changes in the phase of the signal. In order to correctly recover the transmitted data with minimum error, carrier synchronization is essential. One of the challenging tasks in a communication system is synchronization of the carrier signal. In this paper 8PSK modulation scheme is used for data transmission. Since 8PSK achieves high data rate, the probability of actual signal recovery is quite difficult.Here the carrier recovery for 8PSK modulation has been performed.},

When the first one requires a 28-day time, the second one does have problem of accuracy. Hence, a hybrid model is proposed in which the concrete cube is cured using the microwave based accelerated curing procedure and the early strength is used to predict the 28-day strength. Feed-forward neural network model was used to predict compressive strength of the concrete after the microwave curing to ascertain the predictability of neural network models.

abstract={Communication is easily evoked when the necessity to carry out the thoughts and vision arises. As the communication technology developed it cultivated the threats of information security, on the other hand physically challenged people have no possibility to communicate freely hence the urge for development in the field of communication is necessary in present scenario. Aim of this work is to propose a system that improves the present communication system. Here we had put forward the concept of Brain Mobile Interface (BMI) from the basis of Brain Computer Interface (BCI). BMI serves as a device to translate human thoughts about speech without the need of physical movement. Wireless EEG headsets are used to acquire the speech signals directly from the brain and after signal processing it is given to the mobile which consist of inbuilt speller application. With the help of speller application the message to be conveyed is acquired as text which is then converted into speech by means of text to speech converter.},

This work is based on Orthogonal Polynomial Transformation (OPT) to extort the low level feature like texture. Texture is a central feature especially for classifying homogeneous images. For achieving high accuracy the multi resolution technique is used with rotation invariant characteristics. Multiresolution is achieved in some existing methods with high complexity rate. In the proposed work complexity level is reduced by means of reordering coefficients in the form of sub bands. Then, the global feature is constructed and the optimized result is achieved for classifying the cloud.},

abstract={ZigBee and RFID based monitoring, protection and security system is proposed in this paper. The smart node used in this system measures parameters like power, current, voltage and temperature. To prevent electrical fires and overloading, a threshold value is set at each outlet. The power and temperature parameters assessed by the smart node are transmitted to the base node through ZigBee. If the temperature exceeds or an overload occurs, a set of remote control instructions are executed in the PC. The base node instructs the smart node to cut off the power to the corresponding branch circuit. The entire operation can be monitored from a remote station. In this proposed system, RFID technique is added to provide a theft control mechanism. To prevent theft of valuables from an unauthorized person, RFID tags are used. RFID reader senses the RFID labels (master/slave tags) continuously and sends the information to a PC through ZigBee protocol. The database is checked in PC with the received information. If there is any mismatch in the RFID tags, it is considered to be an illegal input and a warning message is generated at the PC. The database is checked for the owner of that particular item and a confirming message is send to that owner. To search for that item the owner can login WEB.

In addition to this, the centralized server maintains two separate data bases i.e. one for the vehicle and another for the person who rides it. A unique id is allotted for the vehicle and RFID card (smart card driving license) can be used to identify the object. The unique identifiers linked to the respective person's bank account debits the penalty/toll fare when the vehicle passes by toll gates/check posts.

Unsupervized forward selection strategy is used for descriptor selection from the large set of descriptors using E-DRAGON software and six descriptors are selected for model development for surface tension. Associative neural network method is used to construct the non-linear prediction model for surface tension. The selected descriptors are used as input data for training and testing the associative neural network. The predicted results are in good agreement with the experimental surface tension of organic compounds with squared correlation co-efficient (R2) of 0.98 for training and 0.932 for testing.

abstract={The operating characteristics of a single-cylinder four-stroke variable compression ratio engine fueled with esterified tamanu oil were investigated. The suitability of esterified Tamanu oil produced from pinnai oil by transesterification process has been studied in variable compression ratio engine. Experiment has been conducted at various loads like 0 kg, 3 kg, 6 kg, 9 kg, and 12 kg with engine speed of 1500 rpm and at compression ratio varies from 14:1 to 18:1. The impact of compression ratio on fuel consumption, combustion parameters, and exhaust gas emissions is investigated. In order to vary the compression ratio, the clearance volume is changed geometrically by tilting cylinder block arrangement. The performance characteristics like specific fuel consumption, brake power, mean effective pressure, brake thermal efficiencies, and exhaust gas temperature are analyzed for Tamanu oil in the variable compression ratio engine. The emission characteristics like hydrocarbon, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide emissions are also measured for Tamanu oil in the same engine. The effect of intake valve closing event-timing modulation on effective compression ratio was also investigated. The motivation behind this analysis was to fix the effective compression ratio for biodiesel. © 2013 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={The use of lauha bhasma, a traditional Indian herbometallic preparation, is in vogue for centuries for the treatment of various ailments related to iron deficiency. The preparation of lauha bhasma requires strict adherence to time-consuming, well-practiced, multistage, and multistep procedures. One of the steps is the treatment of purified metallic ingredients with Triphala decoction (the aqueous extract of Indian gooseberry, Chebulic myrobalans, and Beleric myrobalans) in the presence of sunlight (Bhanupaka). The formation of metal complexes due to the reaction of the metallic ingredients with the constituents of Triphala decoction has been ascertained by FTIR spectroscopy and carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen analyses. Our results demonstrate that Bhanupaka is an essential step in the preparation of lauha bhasma. © 2013 Balaji Krishnamachary et al.},

Thermal conductivity of these nanofluids was measured as a function of nanoparticle concentration (≤2 vol.%), temperature (10-60 °C) and aggregate size. A strong dependence of thermal conductivity enhancement on temperature with higher enhancements at lower temperatures has been observed. Our results on temperature and aggregation dependence of thermal conductivity enhancement show that the thermal conductivity enhancement in ZnO-propylene glycol nanofluids is attributed to formation of solvation layers (liquid layers) of base fluid on the ZnO nanoparticle surfaces. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The traditional D-flip flop is no longer suitable for designing shift registers because of its low-speed performance. Many different types of shift registers, such as Universal Shift registers, Serial In Serial Out, Serial In Parallel Out, Parallel In Parallel Out and Parallel In Serial Out have been developed. Also, there are many low-power shift register design techniques that have been proposed. However, they are all lagging behind in high speed performances. The shift register design using Single clock pulse with Hold Mode (HM-FF) & without Hold Mode (WHM-FF) Flip Flop can be a potential solution to this problem. The shift register design using this proposed method promises to achieve tremendous improvements in performance of speed. When compared to its conventional counterparts, the proposed design is able to attain more than 41.9% reduction in over all time delay, which is targeted to Xilinx Virtex 6 devices. © 2013 IEEE.},

All the way through the innovation in era and its expanding burden, swift development has occurred within the communication field. Electrical quantities, which were initially transferred in the continuous sphere, are drived further and further in the discrete sphere in existence. In favor of enhanced diffusion, distinct rate influences are being substituted through multi rates. Multi rate arrangements like CDMA and OFDM are used frequently in practice. Within the OFDM arrangement, orthogonally located subcarriers are used to embrace the information from the spreader side to the recipient side. The complexity of ISI can be overcome by the existence of guard band in this arrangement and by superior amount of subcarriers the effect of noise gets diminished. On the other hand the huge Peak to Average Power Ratio of these pointers has several objectionable possessions on the arrangement. In this paper various methods are proposed to diminish PAPR in the OFDM arrangement as a result this arrangement can be worned further frequently plus successfully. © 2013 IEEE.},

Communication also fails when a node intrude from one network to another. Communication goes well until every node is within its range, else transmission fails. Therefore it is necessary to build an efficient routing to solve this problem. Here we introduce a new protocol named Enhanced Adhoc On demand Distance Vector (EAODV) to solve this link failure. In this paper we first calculate the average power of a node and the number of hops in the actual path. Secondly, when there is a link failure or path failure we mathematically calculate the number of hops the data has travelled and the remaining number of hops that the data has to travel in that route to reach the destination. At last the paper is concluded by defining the working of this protocol. In this paper we have increased the packet delivery ratio with reduced delay and increased life span of each node. © 2013 IEEE.},

But there exists a vital problem in storing the template in the database since it can be easily bootlegged. In order to overcome these issues a novel method for person identification by their Iris, through securely storing the template is proposed. Visual Cryptography Encryption(VCE) technique is used for securely storing the iris template. By means of VCE, shares are generated for the iris template which is stored in the database instead of storing the entire template. Shares are generated by pixel expansion method. Authentication is provided by comparing the shares. Comparison is done by using Hamming Code. So it is a very effective method of person identification. The proposed method gives an extra security in iris recognition. © 2013 Maxwell Scientific Organization.},

abstract={Molecular self-assembly of biomolecules, especially proteins and peptides has elucidated much interest in recent years due to the reproducibility of structures and the high degree of control on the formation kinetics and morphology by varying the self-assembling conditions. These self-assembled structures have found widespread applications in tissue engineering, drug delivery and electronics. Two pentapeptides, namely Soto peptide (LPFFD) and the Tjernberg peptide (KLVFF), have been proposed to effectively curtail amyloid plaque deposits. Being amphipathic, these molecules can undergo self-assembly that can be influenced by a host of factors including concentration, pH, proteins, salt content, etc. However, this facet is scarcely explored till date, which might pave way for the novel treatment strategy for Alzheimer's disease. Our data show that the peptide spontaneously forms micelles and they are rich in beta sheet structures, which is confirmed using FT-IR, SAED and thioflavin binding studies. While, acidic pH seems to have no role in the formation of higher order structures, alkaline pH promotes longitudinal and lateral stacking interactions resulting in formation of higher order structures. We also found that the hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity of the substrate also play a major role in the formation of higher order structures. Moreover, the micelles formed by the KLVFF peptide under various environmental conditions exhibits excellent surface tension lowering effects which is in good agreement with the cell proliferation data that showed the protective ability of KLVFF peptide against Aβ1-42 cytotoxicity indicating its potential in Alzheimer's disease therapy as an aggregation blocking agent. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

The spatial queries does not provide privacy, because the location of the query reveal sensitive information about the query. Only authorized user is allowed to access the query, even though service provider not able to view the query. This paper focuses on adducing a novel k- nearest neighbor search on the encrypted database. It describes the strong location privacy that renders a query identical in data space from any location. Due to communication cost in query processing, existing work fails to hold this search. We include a method that endeavors strong location privacy, by amalgamate Metric Preserving Transformation (MPT).

abstract={Latest cutting edge technologies like cloud computing, web services, web architecture have enhanced the business experience. The technologies have increased the demand for bandwidth which in turn has heightened the necessity for routers that can handle large traffic volumes up to thousands of packets per second. However, the greatest challenge is to protect the network from unintended information leakage through unauthorized traffic. Firewall act as a defense against this unauthorized traffic by establishing secure communication in networks. Nevertheless, firewalls are controlled by security policies which are complex and fraught with thousands of conflicting rules written by administrators over a period of time while resolving issues. Therefore, an effective firewall conflict management is required to act as a barrier between the trusted and untrusted network traffic opposing unauthorized access to Internet-based enterprises. In this study, we have proposed a framework to handle the policy conflict in firewalls based on risk assessment of conflicts. We have identified the risk level of the policy conflict on the basis of vulnerability assessment on the secured network. We have utilized Dynamic Rule Reordering to reorder the conflicting rules and achieve optimal solutions for conflict resolution. The proposed method was found to detect and anomalies much faster than the existing methods. © 2013 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.},

abstract={Introduction Representatives of the Azotobacteriaceae family are regular inhabitants of soils of roots (rhizosphere) and on the root surface of free-living nitrogen fixing bacteria of the genera Azotobacter and Azospirillum. They are the regular associates of the roots of many tropical grasses and cereals. Their associations with medicinal plants are of paramount importance. The medicinal plants such as Aloe vera and Datura alba were selected to access the nature of association in the rhizosphere and on the roots by the above bacteria. Methods The roots of A. vera had the dominance of nitrogen fixing bacteria (132 × l02/g). The characteristics of the selected bacteria revealed the presence of Azotobacter chroococcum, Azotobacter beijerinckii, Azotobacter vinelandii and Azospirillum lipoferum. The carbon sources such as sucrose, lactose, glucose, maltose, rhamnose, xylose and mannitol either individually or in combination induced the growth of selected nitrogen fixing bacteria (A. chroococcum, A. beijerinckii, and A. vinelandii). Results The maximum growth was recovered with maltose and glucose (1.36S0.D). The mixed carbon sources such as mannitol, maltose and xylose showed elevated growth of the bacterium (A. chroococcum and A. beijerinckii). The production of IAA, a growth promoting hormone by A. chroococcum, A. beijerinckii and A. vinelandii was studied at varying pH ranges from 6 to 9 in the growing medium. The increase in the pH stimulated the growth as well as the synthesis of IAA. Both the growth and the growth hormones are similar in the growing liquid broth. The above observations paved the way for accessing the growth of the seedling of Ocimum sanctum. The application of Azotobacter and Azospirillum species as biofertilizers is a testimony to the effect that IAA on seedlings growth. Conclusion With this we conclude that IAA with its growth promoting capacity dominates the Microbial and Agricultural Biotechnology in the years to come.

abstract={Delay is one of the principal measures of performance used to determine the Level of Service (LOS) at signalized intersections and several methods have been widely used to estimate vehicular delay. Very few studies only have been carried out to estimate delay at signalized intersections under mixed traffic conditions prevailing in developing countries like India. In the present study, various problems associated with delay estimation under mixed traffic conditions in a developing country (India) and the methods to over come them were discussed and an attempt was made to improve the accuracy estimating the same. Five isolated signalized intersections from a fast developing industrial city located in TamilNadu, India were chosen for the study. Site specific PCU values were developed considering the static and dynamic characteristics of vehicles. Saturation flow was also directly measured in the field for the prevailing roadway, traffic and signalized conditions and expressed in PCU/h. Control delay was also measured following HCM 2000 guidelines. Later, this was compared with that estimated from the theoretical delay model. Even after taking several measures, good correlation between observed and predicted delay could not be obtained. Therefore, in the present scenario field measured control delay was taken into account to define LOS. A new criteria for Indian cities recently published in the literature was used to assign LOS grades of study intersections and found to be better reflecting the field conditions.},

The Gas chromatography mass spectrometry analysis provided different peaks determining the presence of 15 different sesquiterpenes namely, Caryophyllene, Germacrene D, Cadinene and Muurolene,ë- Cadinene, à-Cadinol, tau-Muurolol. This study helps to predict the structure, cyclic nature, melting point, biological activity, mass fragmentation pattern of sesquiterpenes.

abstract={In wireless sensor networks (WSN), the transport mechanism necessitates certain functionalities such as reliability, rate control, energy efficiency and fairness, despite of congestion detection technique. Also, since most of the existing literature works is receiver driven, it does not distinguish node level and network level congestion. Hence, in this paper, we propose a reliable and energy efficient congestion control protocol in WSN. In this technique, energy efficient paths are established among source and sink that contains the nodes with sufficient energy levels. If the sink finds that the reliability index of the data transmission path is below the threshold, it chooses the alternate path with good reliability index. For detecting congestion in node level as well as network level, condition based on queue length, link bandwidth and MAC contention are executed. If congestion is detected, an efficient rate control mechanism is employed that adaptively alters the data transmission rate. By simulation results, we show that the proposed technique improves fairness, reliability and energy efficiency. © 2013 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.},

abstract={The TNF-IL-6-STAT3 pathway plays a crucial role in promoting ulcerative colitis-associated carcinoma (UCC). To date, the negative regulation of STAT3 is poorly understood. Interestingly, intestinal epithelial cells of UCC in comparison to ulcerative colitis show high expression levels of anti-inflammatory death-associated protein kinase (DAPK) and low levels of pSTAT3. Accordingly, epithelial DAPK expression was enhanced in STAT3 IEC-KO mice. To unravel a possible regulatory mechanism, we used an in vitro TNF-treated intestinal epithelial cell model. We identified a new function of DAPK in suppressing TNF-induced STAT3 activation as DAPK siRNA knockdown and treatment with a DAPK inhibitor potentiated STAT3 activation, IL-6 mRNA expression, and secretion. DAPK attenuated STAT3 activity directly by physical interaction shown in three-dimensional structural modeling. This model suggests that DAPK-induced conformational changes in the STAT3 dimer masked its nuclear localization signal. Alternatively, pharmacological inactivation of STAT3 led to an increase in DAPK mRNA and protein levels. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that STAT3 restricted DAPK expression by promoter binding, thereby reinforcing its own activation by inducing IL-6. This novel negative regulation principle might balance TNF-induced inflammation and seems to play an important role in the inflammation-associated transformation process as confirmed in an AOM+DSS colon carcinogenesis mouse model. DAPK as a negative regulator of STAT3 emerges as therapeutic option in the treatment of ulcerative colitis and UCC. Copyright © 2013 American Society for Investigative Pathology.},

abstract={In this paper, the use of stirred bead milling, as a top-down method for preparation of Fe2O3-water and Fe2O3-ethylene glycol-water nanofluids is reported. Phase transition from crystalline to amorphous, increased surface area and increased pore volume were observed as a result of high-energy stirred bead milling. Nanofluids were found to be stable despite the absence of any surfactant or other additives. The effect of nanoparticles concentration ( < 2.06 wt%) and temperature (34-55°C) on nanofluids' viscosity has been reported. Relative viscosities of nanofluids showed linear increase with nanoparticles concentration, though independent of temperature. This is the first work wherein the preparation of Fe2O3-based nanofluids by stirred bead milling and their rheological characterisation are reported. Copyright © 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={In this paper, we introduce the modular sequence space of Γ2 of fuzzy numbers using modulus function and examine some topological properties of these space also establish some duals results among them. Lindenstrauss and Tzafriri [7] used the idea of Orlicz function to define the sequence space lM which is called an Orlicz sequence space. Another generalization of Orlicz sequence spaces is due to Woo [9]. We define the sequence spaces Γ2 fλ and Γ2λ g, where f = (fmn) and g = (gmn) are sequences of modulus functions such that fmn and gmn be mutually complementary for each m, n. This paper deals with the modular of Γ2 defined by asymptotically λ- and σ invariant modulus of fuzzy numbers. If fmn and gmn are mutually complementary function then the two sequences X and Y of fuzzy numbers are said to be asymptotically λ- invariant statistical equivalent of multiple 0̄ provided that for every ε &gt; 0,∞, uniformly in η. © 2013 N.

abstract={Background: Development of sensitive sequence search procedures for the detection of distant relationships between proteins at superfamily/fold level is still a big challenge. The intermediate sequence search approach is the most frequently employed manner of identifying remote homologues effectively. In this study, examination of serine proteases of prolyl oligopeptidase, rhomboid and subtilisin protein families were carried out using plant serine proteases as queries from two genomes including A. thaliana and O. sativa and 13 other families of unrelated folds to identify the distant homologues which could not be obtained using PSI-BLAST. Methodology/Principal Findings: We have proposed to start with multiple queries of classical serine protease members to identify remote homologues in families, using a rigorous approach like Cascade PSI-BLAST. We found that classical sequence based approaches, like PSI-BLAST, showed very low sequence coverage in identifying plant serine proteases. The algorithm was applied on enriched sequence database of homologous domains and we obtained overall average coverage of 88% at family, 77% at superfamily or fold level along with specificity of ~100% and Mathew's correlation coefficient of 0.91. Similar approach was also implemented on 13 other protein families representing every structural class in SCOP database. Further investigation with statistical tests, like jackknifing, helped us to better understand the influence of neighbouring protein families. Conclusions/Significance: Our study suggests that employment of multiple queries of a family for the Cascade PSI-BLAST searches is useful for predicting distant relationships effectively even at superfamily level. We have proposed a generalized strategy to cover all the distant members of a particular family using multiple query sequences. Our findings reveal that prior selection of sequences as query and the presence of neighbouring families can be important for covering the search space effectively in minimal computational time. This study also provides an understanding of the 'bridging' role of related families. © 2013 Kaushik et al.},

abstract={The present study investigates dose-dependent effects of trans-resveratrol on the membrane fluidity using planar lipid bilayer and liposome models. The complex admittance plots obtained for the lipid bilayer show that resveratrol below 60 μM preferentially interacts with the polar headgroups at the membrane-electrolyte interface, leading to enhanced membrane admittance and vice versa at higher concentrations (&gt;60 μM). This was confirmed using solid-state 13C and 31P NMR studies and membrane fluidization studies. The localization of resveratrol in the membrane bilayer was found to alter the membrane rigidity, which resulted in a dose-dependent blebbing and lysis of erythrocytes. The protective effect of trans-resveratrol against DPPH also confirms that its localization in the hydrophobic region prevents lipid peroxidation. The cytotoxic effect of resveratrol on a breast cancer cell line also displays a progressive pattern, indicating possible correlation with its membrane rigidifying properties and localization in the lipid bilayer. © 2013 American Chemical Society.},

For this reason efficient File matching algorithms should be used which minimizes computer storage which results in minimum response time on searching process. There are many problems involved in file content matching technique. This technique works for finding the file content similarity. In this study, we propose the new algorithm called Adaptive File Comparison Technique, which converts the source and destination file contents into tokens and finally it makes a matrix format data called sparse matrix. The comparison technique compares the sparse matrices of source and destination files to find the content similarity and dissimilarity which leads to an efficient content matching technique rather than comparing the entire file content. ©Maxwell Scientific Organization, 2013.},

Recognizing a face in a facial database by using segmentation is a trivial challenge for many researchers. To distinguish facial photographic images from a background, the discrete wavelet transform is utilized to extractfacial images. Novel energy function model is used for solving a contour extraction problem. In order to segment images,coarse-to-fine level set scheme is implemented. Finally face recognition process is done by face detection through the segmented images and matches the face with their same photograph, which is avail in the database. Extensive experiments have been carried out on capturing a facial photograph dynamically to validate the proposed method. © Maxwell Scientific Organization, 2013.},

abstract={This paper investigates a rapid and accurate detection system for spoilage in meat. We use unsupervised feature learning techniques (stacked restricted Boltzmann machines and auto-encoders) that consider only the transient response from undoped zinc oxide, manganese-doped zinc oxide, and fluorine-doped zinc oxide in order to classify three categories: the type of thin film that is used, the type of gas, and the approximate ppm-level of the gas. These models mainly offer the advantage that features are learned from data instead of being hand-designed. We compare our results to a feature-based approach using samples with various ppm level of ethanol and trimethylamine (TMA) that are good markers for meat spoilage. The result is that deep networks give a better and faster classification than the feature-based approach, and we thus conclude that the fine-tuning of our deep models are more efficient for this kind of multi-label classification task. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

We also studied the in vitro antidiabetic activity of S. surattensis using the glucose uptake by isolated rat hemidiaphragm model. In vitro studies using mammalian α-glucosidase extracted from the small intestine homogenate of mouse showed that the extract was found to be more effective in inhibiting the activities of maltase [half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50): 209.15 μg/mL] and sucrase (IC50: 366.44 μg/mL) when compared with the control group (acarbose). The extract of S. surattensis were further quantified with respect to porcine pancreatic α-amylase inhibition using the chromogenic 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid method. Interestingly, S. surattensis was also found to exhibit α-amylase (IC50: 123.95 μg/mL) inhibitory activity. The glucose uptake in the rat hemidiaphragm was significantly (p &lt; 0.01) increased by EESS (220.95 ± 5.4 mg/g/30 minute) when compared with the control group. The total polyphenolic content of EESS was found to be 98 μg pyrocatechol/mg of the extract. These results suggest that EESS inhibited carbohydrate digestive enzymes and increased the peripheral uptake of glucose.

abstract={Haemoglobin (Hb) is a respiratory pigment; it is a tetrameric protein that ferries oxygen from the lungs to tissues and transports carbon dioxide on the return journey. The oxygen affinity of haemoglobin is regulated by the concentration of oxygen surrounding it and several efforts have revealed the shapes of Hb in different states and with different functions. However, study of the molecular basis of Hbs from low-oxygen-affinity species is critically needed in order to increase the understanding of the mechanism behind oxygen adaptation. The present study reports the preliminary crystallographic study of low-oxygen-affinity haemoglobin from mongoose, a burrowing mammal. Haemoglobin from mongoose was purified by anion-exchange chromatography, crystallized using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method and diffraction data sets were collected from monoclinic (2.3 Å resolution) and orthorhombic (2.9 Å resolution) crystal forms obtained by pH variation. The monoclinic and orthorhombic asymmetric units contained half and a whole biological molecule, respectively. © 2013 International Union of Crystallography All rights reserved.},

abstract={Cynodon dactylon is a potential source of metabolites such as flavanoids, alkaloids, glycosides and β-sitosterol and has been traditionally employed to treat urinary tract and other microbial infections and dysentery. The present work attempts to evaluate the activity of C. dactylon extracts for glycemic control. Aqueous extracts of C. dactylon analyzed by HPLC-ESI MS have identified the presence of apigenin, luteolin, 6-C-pentosyl-8-C-hexosyl apigenin and 6-C-hexosyl-8-C-pentosyl luteolin. Evaluation of hypoglycemic activity through an extensive in silico docking approach with PPARγ (Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor), GLUT-4 (glucose transporter-4) and SGLT2 (sodium glucose co-transporter-2) revealed that luteolin, apigenin, 6-C-pentosyl-8-C-hexosyl apigenin, 6-C-hexosyl-8-C-pentosyl luteolin interact with SGLT2. Interactions of these molecules with Gln 295 and Asp 294 residues of SGLT2 have been shown to compare well with that of the phase III drug, dapagliflozin. These residues have been proven to be responsible for sugar sensing and transport. This work establishes C. dactylon extract as a potential SGLT2 inhibitor for diabetic neuropathy thus enabling a possibility of this plant extract as a new alternative to existing diabetic approaches. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The prediction of delta ferrite content expressed in terms of ferrite number in austenitic stainless steel welds is very helpful in assessing its performance. The final ferrite content determines the properties of weldments such as strength, toughness, corrosion resistance, and phase stability. This paper presents a study on the effect of process parameters on ferrite number in 202 grade stainless steel gas tungsten arc welded plates (GTAW). Experiments were conducted based on response surface methodology. The ferrite number was determined by using a ferrite scope and by using DeLong diagram. A mathematical model was developed correlating the important controllable GTAW process parameters like welding gun angle, welding speed, plate length, welding current, and shielding gas flow rate with ferrite number. The adequacy of the model was checked using analysis of variance technique. The developed model is very useful to quantitatively determine the ferrite number. The main and interaction effects of the process parameters are presented in graphical form that helps in selecting quickly the process parameters to achieve the desired results. © 2012 Springer-Verlag London Limited.},

abstract={The present work aims at understanding the structural stability of Cadmium oxide (CdO) nano-particles of different sizes due to its potential application in the field of optoelectronics and gas sensing.

But the stable ring geometries for n &gt; 9 are found to be difficult, because the ring structures become more complicated. The present calculation also shows that, with the growth of the clusters, 3D structures are more favorable in energy, and the Cd and O atom tend to adopt higher coordination numbers. Moreover, the simulated IR spectra help to distinguish the ring structures from the cubic or hexagonal packing structures. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Production of a commercially important biodegradable polymer, pullulan, by Aureobasidium pullulans from four agricultural wastes namely wheat bran, rice bran, coconut kernel and palm kernel was evaluated in solid state fermentation. Under the experimental conditions, palm kernel resulted in highest concentration of pullulan (16 g/L) among the four solid substrates. Optimum initial pH and moisture content for pullulan production were found out to be 6.5 and 50% respectively. 18.43 g/L of pullulan was produced from Asian palm kernel with initial pH 6.5 after 7 days of fermentation and yeast like morphology was predominant under this condition. Among different nitrogen sources tried in this study, yeast extract was found to the best. The pullulan produced from palm kernel was characterized by FTIR and 1H NMR. The results were matching with that of commercial pullulan. Thus, Asian palm kernel appears to be an attractive low cost carbon source for the production of pullulan. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Detecting an actual position of an object and a person in the dark region is an atomic challenge for many researchers. To detect the objects and the persons, a spatial filter is utilized. The basic idea of the spatial filter is adapted by varying its radii of the dark region. Based on the radii's variation, the persons and the objects are detected. Finally, the actual position of detecting objects and persons are segmented using object compensation. Extensive experiments have been carried out on an object equipped with an infrared/digital camera and preliminarily tested in different situations. This proposed method is achieved 90.7% accuracy in detecting an actual position of the human and the object in the dark area. © Maxwell Scientific Organization, 2013.},

abstract={Retinoblastoma (RB) is a malignant tumor of the retina seen in children, and potential non invasive biomarkers are in need for rapid diagnosis and for prognosticating the therapy. This study was undertaken to identify the differentially expressed miRNAs in the serum of children with RB in comparison with the normal age matched serum, to analyze its concurrence with the existing RB tumor miRNA profile, to identify its novel gene targets specific to RB, and to study the expression of a few of the identified oncogenic miRNAs in the advanced stage primary RB patient's serum sample. MiRNA profiling was performed on 14 pooled serum from chil- dren with advanced RB and 14 normal age matched serum samples, wherein 21 miRNAs were found to be upregulated (fold change ≥ +2.0, P ≤ 0.05) and 24 to be downregulated (fold change ≤ -2.0, P ≤ 0.05). Furthermore, intersection of 59 significantly deregulated miRNAs identified from RB tumor profiles with that of miRNAs detected in serum profile revealed that 33 miRNAs had followed a similar deregulation pattern in RB serum. Later we validated a few of the miRNAs (miRNA 17-92) identified by microarray in the RB patient serum samples (n = 20) by using qRT-PCR. Expression of the oncogenic miRNAs, miR-17, miR-18a, and miR-20a by qRT-PCR was signifcant in the serum samples exploring the potential of serum miRNAs identification as noninvasive diagnosis. Moreover, from miRNA gene target prediction, key regulatory genes of cell proliferation, apoptosis, and positive and negative regulatory networks involved in RB progression were identified in the gene expression profile of RB tumors. Therefore, these identified miRNAs and their corresponding target genes could give insights on potential biomarkers and key events involved in the RB pathway. © the author(s), publisher and licensee Libertas Academica Ltd.},

abstract={Nanostructured cerium oxide (CeO2) thin films were deposited on transparent conducting oxide (TCO) substrate using spray pyrolysis technique with cerium nitrate salt, Ce(NO3)3·6H2O as precursor. Fluorine doped cadmium oxide (CdO:F) thin film prepared using spray pyrolysis technique acts as the TCO film and hence the bare electrode. The structural, morphological and elemental characterizations of the films were carried out using X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) respectively. The diffraction peak positions in XRD confirmed the formation of highly crystalline ceria with cubic structure and FE-SEM images showed uniform adherent films with granular morphology. The band gaps of CeO2 and TCO were found to be 3.2 eV and 2.6 eV respectively. Lipase enzyme was physisorbed on the surface of CeO2/TCO film to form the lipase/nano-CeO2/TCO bioelectrode. Sensing studies were carried out using cyclic voltammetry and amperometry, with lipase/nano-CeO2/TCO as working electrode and tributyrin as substrate. The mediator-free biosensor with nanointerface exhibited excellent linearity (0.33-1.98 mM) with a lowest detection limit of 2 μM with sharp response time of 5 s and a shelf life of about 6 weeks. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Nanostructured cerium dioxide (CeO2) thin films were deposited on glass substrates at an optimized substrate temperature of 503 K, using spray pyrolysis technique under optimized deposition conditions. An aqueous solution of 0.05 M concentration of Ce(NO3)3·6H2O was used as precursor. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern confirmed the polycrystalline nature of the film with fluorite type face-centered cubic structure. The scanning electron micrographs (SEM) of the annealed films were observed and it was found to be uniform and free from macroscopic defects. An optical energy band gap of 3.63 eV for direct transition was calculated from UV-vis absorbance spectra. Further, the vapour sensing property of annealed CeO2 samples were studied by chemiresistive method for two different volatile organic compounds (VOCs) namely ethanol and trimethylamine at various operating temperatures. Results indicated that the CeO2 thin films changed from n- to p-type character in the presence of ethanol at 323 K till to the maximum temperature studied (400 K) and showed the higher response at 373 K. Conversely, in trimethylamine, the films maintained their n-type character showing appreciable response in the temperature range studied (300-373 K). Therefore, the influence of operating temperature on the selectivity of the CeO2 thin film samples can be effectively used for an efficient food quality assessment. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The prepared sols were characterized by using SEM images show that TiO2 nanorods with uniform diameter of about Uniformly sized TiO2 nanorods were obtained of approximately 10–50 nm in diameter. Effects of pH, concentration are systematically studied. Results show that the adsorption is highly pH-dependent and the removal is almost complete (99%) for pH 3. Equilibrium batch experiments were conducted and the results were found to be fit with the Langmuir isotherm equation. Langmuir constants were obtained b = 0.0273 L/mg and qm = 147 mg/g. This study is to evaluate the suitability of the titanate nano fibres as adsorbent media in a continuous flow packed bed reactor for removing arsenate from water. The desorption studies shows that the percentage desorption has reached 92% at 75 min of desorption. Since the equipment required for TNs synthesis is simple and cheap, and alkali solutions are reusable, TNs can be regarded as an efficient, low-cost adsorbent for the removal of arsenic. © 2013, Springer Science and Business Media, LLC.

abstract={The earlier studies made to find the relationship between corporate governance and firm performance are divided on the questions relating to whether good corporate governance practices are helpful to improve the value of the firm and this has prompted the author to make this study to search for evidence from the Indian stock market. Two important factors included in the modern corporate governance model are, the size of insider ownership and the role independent directors of the Board, as these two factors have important implications in the fulfillment of the objectives of good corporate governance. Jamie Allen (2010) states that board independence has received much of the attention as an idea of corporate governance. The contribution of this study to the existing literature is selecting a near homogeneous sample of firms for the analysis and the inclusion of Market Capitalization Sales ratio as an additional market based performance measure and Cash Profit Margin as one of the control variables to find whether any conclusive evidence could be found in the study of the relationship between firm performance and corporate governance. The findings of the study prove that the management and market dynamics of the Indian firms are different from those of the West. More number of independent directors and diffused ownership seem to be doing no good for the market values of the Indian companies.},

In this paper, genetic algorithm is employed to get shortest possible route from any city to visit all other city once and reach the starting point. If number of cities increase, complexity of the problem increases exponentially. In genetic algorithm principle, Genetic operators are playing important role to produce the optimal result. Hence these are tested with different probabilities for various number of cities each generating different number of population to verify the influence over the TSP to achieve the shortest path efficiently.

The data sets are trained, based on the actual wave period and height already obtained. This data is required to the planners of offshore structures, boat authorities, navigators, fisherman and the engineers producing oil from the offshore platforms. As it is indicating rough weather, it is necessary to the scientists who are involved in forecasting the weather. Once the training set is obtained, it is verified with actual height and necessary pruning over that. The extent of interference from other parameters on wave height is taken from the earlier publications. The predicted and actual values of wave height reached, the inferred profile and the different stages applied are kept as reference block An unknown area has been digitized and compared with the inferred profile of that beach. In such inferred profile, all corrections are applied. After that, by applying the root mean square the data has been validated. A tolerance level of 7 to 10 percent error is envisaged in the measurements. The model is found successful. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Cryptography is an art that includes various techniques to communicate in a secure manner. Encryption and Decryption are done based on the key that is used. There are numerous techniques being used all around the world for encrypting and decrypting the text. Techniques mainly differ based on the way keys are used and shared between sender and the receiver. All these techniques have their own strong and weak points. Through cryptography technique everyone even the third parties can recognize or detect the presence of the message but they will not be able to extract it without the suitable key value. But in case of Steganography, it is difficult to even detect the presence of the message. In this case, the message will be hidden in some other object such as image etc. Once the presence of message is detected by a third party no key value is required to extract the data in steganography. This paper deals about the concept of adding some complexity in extracting the messages from the image even after detecting the presence of the message. Here Complexity will be dealt in 3 levels. First level of complexity can be added by just hiding the message in a particular region of the image instead of hiding it in the entire image so that the third party feels difficult to first identify the segment of the image where the message has been hidden. Second level of complexity involves the different ways to traverse the message hidden. Until the third party finds out the way to read the message the context of the message can never be understood. Third level of complexity is that the hidden image will be in the encrypted format so that it adds still more complexity to extract the data without finding the key value and the encryption technique implemented by the sender. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={A method is introduced to address the estimation of pose for 2D-3D images. This approach involves the tracking of 2D images in 3D spaces which results in the estimation of pose with the continuous process of particle filtering and handling the scheme in the presence of occlusion. In order to maintain the track and to detect the exact region, a unique method Region Based Tracking method is used in this paper. It also involves the translation and rotation vectors which determine the position and an estimation of the object sustaining particle filters and handling occlusions. Particle filtering and occlusion handling can be done for 2-D images in a 3-D space. Finally, this method is considered to be more effective in both robustness and speed compared to similar video tracking and pose estimation methods. Thus the conversion of pose estimation from 2D Silhouette curve to 3D Occluding Curve is finally eliminated in the video. © Research India Publications.},

There are no concrete methods available which can give a definite measure of quality and the subsequent prediction based on the availability of metrics. This paper tries to evaluate the present quality of a web application from a set of known parameters. The technical complications of the Websites and web applications make the quality evaluation more difficult. Moreover many of the existing tools that appraise the web applications are not capable of evaluating the operation and quality of a webpage and amongst those tools most of them focus on evaluating appearance and accessibility characteristics of a quality model. This paper tries to analyze a collection of quality characteristics of the quality model and helps the decision makers in making the right decision for various known web applications. Based on the studied quality metrics, a training set has been made for predicting the quality characteristics of the websites using the various prism methodologies. This paper mainly proposes a Quality evaluation tool for evaluating the usability characteristic and predicting the quality level of that characteristic through prism classification. This paper also makes use of Gini Index for proving the purity of attributes taken. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={This proposed paper presents about the survey on segmentation of images using clustering methods and algorithms among certain applications. Image segmentation is a primary and significant method to be conceded in image analysis. Image segmentation is the method of distributing an image into several segments to make them enriched by means of appearance and understandability. Image segmentation consumes numerous methods to segment an image. This paper studies about the clustering techniques used in the field of remote sensing and MRI diagnosis applications. Initially this paper investigates about the basic steps to process an image. Clustering is a technique to group a number of similar pixels with a similarity criterion to form clusters. This involves many techniques to cluster, in which fuzzy clustering is used wide with FCM algorithm which results better outcomes. Then a survey of clustering techniques is given in this paper and finally about other methods and algorithms applied in clustering are presented. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={To Achieve concurrency through the pipelining or parallel processing in non recursive digital filters is not a tedious work compared to recursive digital filter like IIR which is due to the presence of feedback loop. IIR filters have sharper cut offs and better response compared to FIR filters with fewer coefficients. However, the quantization noise of IIR filter is more compared to FIR filter. Therefore, an IIR filter requires attention to use pipelining approaches like look ahead computation. In this paper, we have implemented a pipelining approach for a generic second order recursive IIR filter using Verilog HDL. For each technique the coefficients are calculated in MATLAB and then Verilog HDL code is generated. The functionality is verified from the impulse responses obtained from the model sim Simulations results. Thus the critical path delay can be observed from timing report of synthesis and further pipelining is done. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Multiprocessor scheduling in real time systems follows global queue and partitioned queue methods. Partitioned queue scheduling technique organised with dedicated queues and tasks are scheduled to corresponding processor, based on Earliest Deadline First (EDF) algorithm. EDF is an optimal technique to schedule aperiodic, periodic and sporadic tasks in Real Time Systems (RTS). Deadline of the task is a major objective of EDF and resource maintenances are negligible. It increases task migration and switching between jobs to achieve the need. Context switching reduces the system quality of services and also increases overhead. In our paper we propose D-EDF (Desirable EDF) technique with 'claim ' value μ(t), which schedules aperiodic tasks feasibly, as well as reducing the context switching and improving the efficiency of system performance apart from reducing overheads. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={The binding of two or more images having same property with different scenario into a single image is called as image fusion. The image fusion improves the quality of image which can be used to retrieve more information. The fusion technique can be varying based on input images. Numerous types of sensors are used to capture images with different scenarios. The IHS and GIHS methods are mostly used to fuse Panchromatic (PAN) and Multispectral (MS) images. This paper explains how the IHS and GIHS methods are used for quality fusion. The IHS method will be used to fuse three band images where the GIHS method used to fuse four band images. These both methods will transform the bands into their properties to fuse them. The output of the both methods will be a single high resolution image. The both methods solve the color distortion problem and improve the quality of the image. The quality of the fusion w ill be decided by the parameters SAM, ERGAS, UIQI, mean, bias, standard deviation and correlation. These two methods giving high resolution output as well as consuming very less time for execution. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Steganography focusses on the efficient hiding of data in cover files. images have extensively been used as cover files throughout. This paper focusses on the use of audio files as cover wherein the audio samples are scaled to an integer value after which embedding is done. Substitution method being simple and effective, is used to embed the data bits. The primary advantage of using audio samples for embedding is that, the huge sampling rate in audio files gives the user lot of space to embedd data into. The steganography process hugely depends on the imperceptibility of the Human Auditory System and aims at exploiting the weakness of human hearing capability. This paper introduces a mechanism in which the data bits to be embedded are arranged in a matrix form and different traversal mechanisms are undertakan to substitute with the scaled sample values. The data bits are encrypted before substitution is carried out. The embedded data can be text, or even images, which we propose to extend this mechanism to. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Introduction: Successful tissue engineering strategies leading to the regeneration of a tissue depend on many factors, starting from the choice of appropriate scaffold material, tailoring the surface functionalities and topography, providing the correct amount of chemical and mechanical stimuli at the appropriate time points, and ensuring the uniform and precise localization of cells. Further challenges arise when more than one cell type has to be employed for the effective regeneration of an organ. Importance: Though the use of nanomaterials has improved tissue engineering, many pitfalls still exist that present a roadblock in the translation of tissue engineering strategies to clinical practice. Apart from employing different materials with distinct surface functionalities and mechanical properties, various strategies have been employed to manipulate the surface topography and chemistry of scaffolds to create a biomimetic microenvironment for effective tissue regeneration. Conclusion: This review provides information about the factors influencing tissue engineering, namely geometry, chemistry, mechanics and cells, and the emerging concepts that may well represent the future of regenerative medicine. Electrospinning techniques and their variants, self-assembly, cell-printing techniques and cell sheet engineering, have all been elaborated in detail. These novel techniques may serve to overcome the challenges currently faced in tissue engineering. © 2013 Krishnan and Sethuraman.},

abstract={Organic polymers that can be efficiently degraded by microorganisms can be referred to as biodegradable compounds. Polyhydroxybutyrates (PHB) are decomposable polymers amassed as carbon storage materials in microbial cells, which can be utilized as a substitute for petrochemical centered plastics that pose a major environmental hazard. However, the most challenging problem in commercializing PHB is the high manufacturing cost because of costly carbon substrate and tedious production processes. Hence there is a requirement for appropriate protocols to explore the properties of unique strains and low-cost substrates. Suitable extraction processes are essential for the economical production of PHB. From this point of view the current study was designed to utilize the distillery waste water as a carbon source for the production of PHB from Bacillus silvestris. The study has demonstrated an improved production of PHB from microorganisms in the presence of distillery wastes as a suitable media. Furthermore, five strains (A, B, C, D and E) were obtained by subjecting the wild type strain to UV irradiation, and their PHB production capabilities were studied. The peak production was observed after the 54th hour of growth in the strain E and its PHB yield was significantly higher than that of the wild type strain.},

abstract={Performance and serviceable life of oil filled transformers are primarily governed by the behavior of insulating oil. Such transformers, during operation, may experience several stress evolving operating conditions. Deterioration in the performance of oil filled transformers are directly associated with the degradation of oil during the course of operation with different loading conditions. Further, the oil characteristics undergo appreciable variations since the chemical compositions in the oil are subjected to variations. Partial Discharges (PD) in insulating oil is one of the proven indices which exhibit the changing characteristics of oil. PD activity in oil insulating medium is influenced by several factors that are invariably directly correlated to the physics and chemistry of the insulant. The proposed article focuses on assessing the PD activity in different transformer oil insulations under different applied voltages. Further, the investigations also confined towards the correlation of PD phenomenon with Conduction Current (CC) through insulating oil. Various categories of iso-paraffin base and naphthenic base transformer oil have been taken into consideration which include new untreated oil, thermally degraded oil, oil degraded with transient signals and mixture of oil with solid dielectric materials. Detailed analysis based on experimental studies reveals that the dynamics of PD activity in degraded oil display unique discharge signatures when compared with new untreated oil. Also, it is evident that the PD activity is enhanced with the oil which contains a mixture of solid dielectric materials and with thermally degraded oil. Further, simultaneous measurement of conduction current and partial discharge activity in oil depicts that the dynamics of oil degradation is well observable in conduction current wave and correlation of both signatures yields better results interms of understanding the changes in oil behavior with time.},

abstract={Electricity demand exceeds the supply leading to regional blackout. The power generated is transmitted through a large network and significant power losses in transmission and distribution feeders. Loss reduction through various methods has the potential to yield huge savings in economic growth and environmental impact. One such effective loss minimization method is to inject reactive power by placing shunt capacitors at appropriate places with proper size. A Harmony Search Algorithm methodology is proposed in this work to identify the appropriate size of shunt capacitors by taking the objective as minimizing the cost associated with real power losses along with installation cost of shunt capacitors in an unbalanced radial distribution network. The bus voltage limits, number/size of installed capacitors at each node are taken as constraints. A two stage methodology is adopted in this work to get the solution of the optimization problem. In the first stage, the voltage stability index values at each bus is computed and the node with minimum value of voltage stability index is identified as the most receptive node to voltage slump and such a node is considered as candidate node for installation of shunt capacitors. In the second stage the HSA methodology is used to ascertain the suitable capacitor size. The backward / forward sweep algorithm based Radial distribution load flow algorithm is utilized for power flow simulation. The proposed Harmony Search Algorithm is implemented on the modified IEEE 13 and 37 bus URDN.},

abstract={For several decades, computer's memory has been volatile. High speed memories such as DRAM and SRAM have been used as main memory and cache memory respectively. Magnetic disks are used as the persistent secondary storage devices. The present DRAM based main memory has reached its energy lits. Due to the advent of nonvolatile memories like PCM, MRAM, RRAM, FeRAM and Flash, there is growing interest in incorporating them into the computers as the main memory alternates. Introducing the non-volatile storage devices in memory hierarchy is considered to reduce the energy consumption since non- volatile memories have got no power leakage in memory cells. A major hurdle in this direction is the poor the endurance limit of most non-volatile memory technologies in comparison to the RAM technologies. Among the nonvolatile memory technologies, PCM is the most attractive and the most investigated option due to it advantages over other memory types. But there are few issues related to PCM that need to be addressed in order to integrate it as a potential memory for computers. There have been intense researches being carried out to devise new memory architectures based on PCM. There are also methods identified to overcome the issues of PCM. This paper analyses the various challenges in integrating PCM into the system and the various PCM based main memory architectures that have been proposed so far. © IDOSI Publications, 2013.},

abstract={Banking cards are widely used for performing various financial transactions. The usage of cards is considered to be convenient and safe over transactions by cash payments. There are several types of cards available today and among them, the debit and credit cards are the most commonly used. Debit cards are provided by the banks to the account holders in order access the accounts electronically. A credit card is a payment card issued to the users as a system of payment. Every credit card holder gets a revolving account with the card issuing bank and granted with a line of credit. Most of the banks offer both credit cards and debit cards. Due to the benefits of debit and credit cards, a normal customer would prefer to have both the cards and selectively use either of the cards for a transaction. Even though it is beneficial to have both the cards, carrying two separate cards everywhere is regarded as inconvenient and unsafe. So the objective our work is to devise a model to integrate two card functionalities into one card and let the user choose the mode of the card. In our model, the user may change the card mode using the keypad provided at the backside/front of the card. A four digit security pin has to be entered for that. User could see the present mode of the card on a small LCD screen available in the card. When the card mode is set to 'lock', the card gets blocked and any attempt to use the card will be declined. Unlocking could be done by restoring the mode to debit or credit. The proposed model of the card incorporates a Processor, ROM, NVRAM, LCD screen and a keypad. The whole circuit will be powered by battery. Finally a review of the model is done and the benefits, limitations and future research possibilities as identified. © 2005 - 2013 JATIT & LLS.

abstract={Steganography is the science of communicating secret data using an appropriate carrier. It is based on the concept that if the feature is revealed then it is liable to attack. Thus the main aim of steganography is to conceal the embedded data from eavesdroppers. Moreover it should maintain the quality of the carrier medium and anti-steganalysis should be hard to accomplish. This paper introduces a novel approach to image steganography which attains the above by performing mod-3 and stratification. To begin with, mod-3 operation is performed in each byte of the secret image. The result would either be a 0, 1 or 2. Based on the result that byte is placed in anyone of the three data files. As a result, three data files of the secret image are obtained. The carrier image is chosen and the three data files are appended below the carrier image one after the other. A pass-key is used for security purpose and it is also used as a delimiter between the layers. Text can also be encrypted and appended as one of the layers to the carrier image. The receiver receives the Stego image and performs the reverse process. The experimental result shows that the carrier image and secret image are independent of size. This is done after pointing out the related approaches and then highlighting this model's contributions with respect to the embedding and extraction processes. © Research India Publications.},

The modes of operation, control signals, and operating principle of the proposed inverter are analyzed. The inverter is capable of producing five levels of output-voltage (V<inf>s</inf>, V<inf>s</inf>/2, 0,-V<inf>s</inf>,-V<inf>s</inf>/2) from the dc supply voltage. In particular, aspects of total harmonic distortion (THD) for the proposed multilevel converters are discussed. The hybrid cascaded H-Bridge inverter with very low switching losses is ideal for such operations. The behaviour of the inverter has been analyzed with the simulation and experimental results. In this paper a new five level inverter with reduced number of switches is proposed and MATLAB/SIMULINK results are presented.},

abstract={Power quality issues create adverse economical impacts on the consumers and utilities. The main cause of harmonics are the non linear loads. An unified power quality conditioner (UPQC) is used for mitigating the problems of harmonics in voltage as well as current that arise due to nonlinear loads. The UPQC constitutes of both shunt active filter as well as series active filter connected in antiparallel with a common capacitor across the dc side of both the converters. In this paper, Artificial Neural Network is used as a tool for power quality improvement. Neural network based refernce signal generation is adopted for a series converter. Reference signal for shunt active filter is produced using P-Q theory. Switching signals of the Voltage source inverter (VSI) are produced by incorporating hysteresis current controller. Also neural network based control is adopted for maintining constant voltage across the dc capacitor, since PI controller method exhibits lack of performance when the load meets up with disturbances or changes in parameters. The proposed system 's performance is observed using MATLAB software and the result of proposed UPQC meets the IEEE-519 standard recommendations on harmonic levels. © 2013 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.},

abstract={Distributed energy sources cadge today's demand. The distributed generation is one of the alternative methods for reducing the gap between power generation and demand. The distributed generation confirms the efficacy of meeting escalating demand when placed at appropriate location with proper size. The objective of this work is to track the suitable place with appropriate size of the Distributed Generators to be installed in an unbalanced radial distribution test system to minimize the power losses while satisfying the operational constraints like rms value of bus voltage limit and the thermal limits of radial feeder lines. The proper location for placing the Distributed Generators is identified by estimating voltage stability index. A meta-heuristic approach based on Differential Evolution algorithm is utilized to get the optimal sizing of Distributed Generation. The proposed algorithm is implemented on the modified IEEE 37 bus unbalanced radial distribution network. © 2013 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.},

abstract={Picture quality and un detect ability are the key aspects of steganography. In this study, the proposed framework uses a novel approach to enhance the steganographic scheme with optimized picture quality and higher anti-steganalysis capability. To achieve this, the secret image is hidden in the carrier image by creating layers in Stegoimage. Differing from previous works, this method retains the quality of the carrier image and it doesn't depend on the size of the carrier image and shows better imperceptibility. To abate to the damage in the reconstructed carrier image, the secret image is divided into two segments, one with odd bytes and the other with even bytes. These are embedded into the carrier image in the form of layers rather than embedding it on the carrier image itself. A pass-key is used for security purpose. This is done after pointing out the related approaches and then highlighting this model's contributions with respect to the embedding and extraction processes. © 2013 Academic Journals Inc.},

abstract={In this study, projected a model for safe secret-digital file transmission by having Steganography as the ground. Steganography, in prehistoric times, dealt with camouflage of secrets between two parties. A part from text, many images, audio and video in millions are shared between millions. All sorts of the aforesaid face a common and serious challenge. Here proposed three routines, in which clandestine information is embedded based on the key in method 1, i.e., number and position of Is in the four Least Significant Bits (LSB) of the key decides the pixels for embedding. In method 2, position of Is in the entire key decides the pixels and the position of Is in four LSBs only decides the location for embedding. In method 3, secret data is plunged by means of the same process but not directly. Instead, it is encoded by Huffman Coding and then embedded. Justification for this study is given by computing Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) values for all the planes in the images by taking sample key values for all the three methods. Experimental results are demonstrated and the corresponding image outputs are also presented. © 2013 Academic Journals Inc.},

abstract={This study proposes the usage of humanoid as a sensor node, which uses its inherent locomotion abilities that turns the sensor node dynamics simultaneously on with an installation of a transceiver. The humanoid is capable of wireless transmission of sensor data to a place of desired location and accordingly correction measures can be taken. The system requires the development of three independent modules namely the humanoid, a transmitter/receiver and a sensor node. The humanoid is manually operated through an on-board Atmega kit and an interface (computer) at operator's side. It is developed to move forward, turn right and left and sitting still when power to its servos is turned off. The transmitter/receiver module operating at 433 MHZ is capable of sending 4 bit parallel data. Transceiver is fed data through an encoder with 4 data lines, likewise at receiver end a decoder with 4 output data lines is used. Sensor module consists of Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) sensor, studied with ethanol in the present paper. Its output is fed to 4 comparators whose outputs in turn are fed to data lines of an encoder which is provided with 4 variable range concentration windows. Finally sensor and transmitter/receiver module is integrated and installed on the humanoid. Hence humanoid can be sent to a remote location and ethanol concentration can be detected. © 2013 Academic Journals Inc.},

abstract={The rapid growth of the Internet over the last two decades has enormously increased the abundant of computer data such as audio, images and videos to the public. It has greatly facilitated the hacking and unauthorized distribution of those digital media, which become simple and easier due to the adequate technology processing platforms. To enforce the intellectual property rights and digital media from tampering, "digital watermarking" technique can be used. The pixel values of the watermark which is embedded with the asset image are directly modified in spatial domain watermarking technique. Transform domain watermarking embed the watermark in the transform domain like modifying the spectral coefficients of both asset and watermark images. In this paper, we implement watermarking in hybrid domain which modify the image regarding both spatial and spectral coefficients. DWT is applied to both the asset and message which is to be hidden in the asset image. The watermark is embedded spatially with the HL, LH and HH components which has been wavelet transformed using various wavelet filters. The Mean Square Error (MSE) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) are evaluated to test the imperceptibility of the watermark. Watermarked image suffers some different signal attacks like compression, adding salt and pepper noise, image cropping, image rotation and filter which are used to evaluate the robustness of a watermark. Simulation results show the Daubechies 10 wavelet produces better response among all the others, at the cost of more computation. © 2013 Academic Journals Inc.},

abstract={The increase in globalization results in the increment of power demand, but because of limited power sources the system is forced to operate at its maximum capacity. Therefore it is very necessary to identify the maximum capacity limit of the system; in order to avoid the voltage collapse. The status of voltage stability in a power system is determined by using Stability Indices. In this project Fast Voltage Stability Index (FVSI) has been deployed and their effectiveness is being analyzed on "IEEE 9 Bus System". The FVSI is used to identify critical lines and buses, hence the FVSI is calculated for all the transmission lines present in the system and finally a Rank List is prepared by placing the lines having index nearly equal to one. In addition, the FACTS controllers are incorporated at the critical lines, in order to improve the voltage stability of the system. The FACTS devices also provide a most reliable and efficient control for Real and Reactive power flow as well as voltage magnitude in the power system. Further the above analysis is carried out by the help of Power World Simulator software in various transmission lines which are subjected to different loading conditions and hence the maximum loadability conditions of the system can be predetermined and the FACTS controllers are placed at the lines which are in the verge of instability, such that the voltage collapse can be avoided thereby protecting the total black out of the system. © 2013 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.},

abstract={Nanofiber based scaffolds offer great promise in regeneration of various tissues including esophagus. Diseases of the esophagus such as malignancy and strictures require surgical intervention to repair the affected region using an appropriate substitute. Long gap esophageal atresia poses a clinical challenge to bridge the gap. In this study, nanofibrous scaffolds made of PCL and PCL-gelatin were fabricated through electrospinning. The average diameter of PCL and PCL-gelatin nanofibers were found to be 324±50 nm and 242±30 nm respectively. PCL-gelatin nanofibers was characterized using FTIR, DSC, UTM, Goniometer, suture retention strength and in vitro degradation and the results were compared with the PCL nanofibers. PCL nanofiber characterization results showed that it exhibited higher tensile strength, suture retention strength, contact angle and slower degradation when compared with the PCL-gelatin nanofibers. Further, the interaction of human esophageal epithelial cells with PCL and PCL-gelatin nanofibrous scaffold was determined by cell adhesion, proliferation and gene expression studies. Our results demonstrated that the epithelial cells adhered and proliferated well on both PCL and PCL-gelatin nanofibrous scaffolds and also exhibited the characteristic cobblestone morphology. Cell proliferation on PCL-gelatin nanofibrous scaffold was significantly higher than the PCL nanofibrous scaffold (*p <0.05). Therefore, these scaffolds could be explored as potential candidates for regeneration of functional esophagus. Copyright © 2013 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.},

abstract={The generation of sine wave at low frequency is very tedious because the size of the inductors used in the circuit is very large and bulky. Hence the inductor is replaced with the simulated inductor. This study deals with the generation of sine wave from an active tuned oscillator which consists of the simulated inductor and capacitor. The oscillator makes use of the basic blocks of a band pass filter using the simulated inductor and a diode limiter. This circuit has the advantage of improving the quality of the wave by increasing the Q-factor of the band pass filter. It also decreases the Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) in the sine wave. The simulation is done using the analog simulator software PSPICE and the total harmonic distortion is calculated using MATLAB. © Maxwell Scientific Organization, 2013.},

abstract={The crucial and difficult task in landslide susceptibility analysis is estimating the probability of occurrence of future landslides in a study area under a specific set of geomorphic and topographic conditions. This task is addressed with a data-driven probabilistic model using likelihood ratio or frequency ratio and is applied to assess the occurrence of landslides in the Tevankarai Ar sub-watershed, Kodaikkanal, South India. The landslides in the study area are triggered by heavy rainfall. Landslide-related factors-relief, slope, aspect, plan curvature, profile curvature, land use, soil, and topographic wetness index proximity to roads and proximity to lineaments-are considered for the study. A geospatial database of the related landslide factors is constructed using Arcmap in GIS environment. Landslide inventory of the area is produced by detailed field investigation and analysis of the topographical maps. The results are validated using temporal data of known landslide locations. The area under the curve shows that the accuracy of the model is 85.83%. In the reclassified final landslide susceptibility map, 14.48% of the area is critical in nature, falling under the very high hazard zone, and 67.86% of the total validation dataset landslides fall in this zone. This landslide susceptibility map is a vital tool for town planning, land use, and land cover planning and to reduce risks caused by landslides. © 2011 Saudi Society for Geosciences.},

abstract={Electric discharge machining (EDM) is one of the most widely used die-making processes especially in aerospace, automobile and electronics industries. The profile manufactured by EDM process should be dimensionally and geometrically accurate apart from good finish. This expectation is very much important as the die manufactured from EDM process is subjected to subsequent mass production. The material normally selected for die making will be superior in quality and hence time and cost of production will also be high. Selection of optimum EDM parameters may reduce the machining time along with maintaining required surface finish and dimensional accuracy. So there is a need to develop a technique for selecting the optimal EDM parameters to achieve the desired performance measures. In the present work, a recently developed Firefly Algorithm (FA) was implemented in the developed mathematical model based on the experiments conducted on an EDM. Investigations are also carried out to study the effect of EDM parameters such as current and pulse-on time on the surface roughness and machining time. The optimized machining parameters and the developed empirical relations are validated by confirmatory experiments. Machining parameters limits and desired surface finish are considered as practical constraints for both experimental and theoretical approaches. The predicted and actual machining time and surface roughness values reveals that FA is very much suitable for solving machining parameters optimization problems. © 2013, Springer-Verlag London.},

abstract={Study of wear behaviour of sintered low alloy steels is required to ascertain their applications for wear resistance. In the present work the influence of copper and molybdenum on wear behaviour of plain carbon steel (Fe-0.5%C) using pin-on-disk arrangement has been addressed. Atomized iron (Fe), graphite (C), copper (Cu) and molybdenum (Mo) elemental powders were suitably weighed and thoroughly mixed in a pot mill to yield the alloy powders of Fe-0.5%C, Fe-0.5%C-2%Cu and Fe-0.5%C-2%Mo. Admixed alloy powders were then compacted and sintered for obtaining preforms of aspect ratio (height/diameter) 1.3 and diameter 25. mm. The sintered preforms were then hot extruded and subsequently machined to obtain wear test specimens of diameter 6. mm and height 50. mm. Using Design of Experiment software, the sliding wear experiments were planned and conducted on a pin-on-disk tribometer. It has been found that there is a substantial improvement in wear resistance of the P/M plain carbon steel by the addition Mo rather than Cu. However coefficient of friction is higher due to presence of hard microstructural phases. Delamination wear is found predominant for both the alloy steels. Empirical correlations for mass loss and coefficient of friction with respect to load/speed have been developed for the alloy steels. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={A nano-interfaced biosensor for superoxide (O2·-) was developed based on superoxide dismutase (SOD) immobilized on iron oxide nanoparticles (nano Fe3O4) coated on a gold electrode surface. Nano Fe3O4 were synthesized via hydrothermal method and superoxide dismutase enzyme (SOD) was attached to it by covalent linking. FT-IR, FE-SEM and XRD have been used for morphological and structural characterization of nano Fe3O4. The modified electrode was used to detect superoxide radicals generated using sodium hydroxide and dimethyl sulfoxide. The cyclic voltammetry studies of the SOD/nano Fe 3O4/Au bioelectrode exhibited an electrochemical reduction behavior for increasing concentrations of SOD at a scan rate of 0.1 V/s in a cell containing 5 mL phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.4). Amperometric studies revealed that the nano-interfaced bioelectrode displayed a sharp response time of 4 s with a limit of detection (LOD) as 3.46 nM and limit of quantification as (LOQ) as 11.5 nM. The response is found to be linear in the range of 0.2-1.4 μM superoxide. The sharp response time is attributed to the fact that rapid and direct electron transfer between the SOD tagged nano Fe3O 4 and the gold electrode without any redox mediator. The biosensor also exhibited good reproducibility stability and shelf life. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Agriculture sector is the backbone of Indian economy. With the advent of electric motors, the burden of manual irrigation by farmers has mitigated a lot. But still frequent power cuts and voltage fluctuations have affected the proper irrigation of fields in many remote areas. There have been several innovative efforts to automate the irrigation of fields. This study proposed an automatic irrigation system based on voice commands from an illiterate farmer. A separate module for speech to text conversion is interfaced to the farmers mobile. The module uses the Hidden Markov Model for speech recognition and a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) or processor based system to store the texts. Besides this, the system also includes a wireless network based remote monitoring of the field's temperature and moisture. The voltage monitoring unit informs the farmer about the power availability in the field. The control unit is based on the Peripheral Interface Controller (PIC) controller and relays connected to the various valves. Controller shuts off the motor if the measured values of temperature and moisture have reached the prefixed levels. The proposed system would reduce the hardships of the farmer and helps in efficient utilization of water in the fields. © 2013 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

The objective of the study was to appraise the effect of milling on the physical dispersions of Nimesulide along with the polymers which helps to enhance the solubility and thereby increases the bioavailability of poorly aqueous soluble drug Nimesulide, using natural and synthetic polymers such as Carrageenen and Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) 4000. Physical dispersions of Nimesulide and the polymers were prepared in the ratios 1:1, 1:3 and 1:5, subjected to size reduction, by Ball Milling technique at two different time intervals 30 and 90 min. The flow properties and solubility of the milled physical dispersions were evaluated and compared with that of non milled physical dispersions and pure drug. Milled physical dispersions were made into tablets and hardness, weight variation, disintegration time, drug content and dissolution were evaluated. The formulations were characterized by Fourier Transform Infra Red Spectroscopy (FTIR), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and X-Ray Diffractometer (XRD) for its solubility and solid state modification. The results reveal that both the polymers mentioned above help in increasing the solubility of Nimesulide, and ball milling with PEG 4000 has a better effect than milling with carrageenen.},

abstract={Inulinases constitute an important class of enzymes for producing fructose and fructooligosaccharides, which are extensively used in pharmaceutical and food industry. The production of inulinase has been reported from various fungal, yeast and bacterial strains. A local fungal isolate identified as Aspergillus niger was tested for the optimization of inulinase production in solid state fermentation. Various fermentation parameters such as pH, temperature, inoculum size, incubation time, carbon sources and nitrogen sources were analyzed. Four different substrates banana peel, garlic peel, wheat bran and Rice bran were used. Among the four substrates the use of banana peel (12 g) at 40% moisture resulted in maximum production of inulinase. Furthermore, the optimal conditions such as pH, temperature, and suitable buffer to obtain maximum stability and activity of the enzyme were identified. Enzyme activity was found to be highest at pH 4.8 and at 45°C while present in the acetate buffer. The high residual activity of the enzyme at 45°C and also at 80°C indicated that the enzyme was more stable at these temperatures.},

SdiA, a transcriptional regulator of uropathogenic E. coli quorum sensing system that controls virulence arsenal. Natural products offer unlimited opportunities for new drug leads because of the utmost availability of chemical diversity. Here, the potentiality of five different extracts of Melia dubia root for quorum sensing inhibitory activity were investigated against uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). The assays such as cell density, swarming motility, protein, protease, hemolysis, hemagglutination, hydrophobicity and biofilm inhibition were performed. The biofilm, hemolysis, swarming motility were found to be inhibited by 60.6, 14.45 and 22.64 %, respectively when the media was supplemented with 30 mg/mL of ethanolic extract and other parameters were also found decreased. The GC-MS spectrum of ethanolic extract showed an array of 38 structurally unlinked compounds with the natural ligands. From this docking studies, it is observed that the compound 7 and 27 are having better Glide Score of 11.5, 11.2 respectively than the native ligand C8HSL (9.4). Compound 7 forms three hydrogen strong bond interactions with the amino acid residues TRP67, ASP80 and SER43 and compound 27 forms two hydrogen bond interactions with TRP67 and SER43. The interacting amino acids were almost same in C 7, C 27 and C8HSL. The in vitro and in silico docking analysis and drug likeness prediction data showed fairly good correlation, suggesting that the ethanolic extract have the potency to attenuate the quorum sensing of uropathogenic E. coli. Further studies by in vitro and in vivo strategies are mandatory to find out the quorum quenching effect of the ligands.},

abstract={With the rabid development of the wireless technology, the gadgets that were once a luxury, have now become a necessity. The wireless technology was first developed for army utilisation. But later, because of the wide applications it had, it became a global obligation. But, today, with the advent of internet, the security of the wireless networks has been at a great stake. And also, the new generation of wireless network demands higher data requirements which is achieved by higher data bits per unit bandwidth because of a variety of multimedia applications, cost efficiency, spectral efficiency and security. In this study all of these challenging requirements are met by Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) along with steganography. It is an attractive and explorative area for the next and future generation of wireless multimedia applications. The major challenging issue in the design of an OFDM transceiver is its high Beak-to-Average Bower Ratio (BABR). In this study, design of an OFDM system adopting Partial Transmit Sequence (PTS) and Selected Mapping (SLM) techniques were concentrated. We analyse the system performance for various values of subcarriers and modulation schemes by computing Complementary Cumulative Distribution Function (CCDF) and analysing the Bit Error Rate (BER). BABR value is low as the number of subcarriers has been increased. BTS outperforms SLM when complexity is considered and SLM is preferred when the redundant bits in the information are high and data embedding algorithm is included after modulation to ensure wireless security. © 2013 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

A wavelet method for a class of space-time fractional Klein-Gordon equations with constant coefficients is proposed, by combining the Haar wavelet and operational matrix together and efficaciously dispersing the coefficients. The behavior of the solutions and the effects of different values of fractional order α are graphically shown. The fundamental idea of the Haar wavelet method is to convert the fractional Klein-Gordon equations into a group of algebraic equations, which involves a finite number of variables. The examples are given to demonstrate that the method is effective, fast, and flexible; in the meantime, it is found that the difficulties of using the Daubechies wavelets for solving the differential equation, which need to calculate the correlation coefficients, are avoided. © 2013 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.},

abstract={A simplified guidance scheme for the target missiles used in Ballistic Missile Defence is presented in this paper. The proposed method has two major components, a Ground Guidance Computation (GGC) and an In-Flight Guidance Computation. The GGC which runs on the ground uses a missile model to generate attitude history in pitch plane and computes launch azimuth of the missile to compensate for the effect of earth rotation. The vehicle follows the pre launch computed attitude (theta) history in pitch plane and also applies the course correction in azimuth plane based on its deviation from the pre launch computed azimuth plane. This scheme requires less computations and counters In-flight disturbances such as wind, gust etc. quite efficiently. The simulation results show that the proposed method provides the satisfactory performance and robustness. © 2013, The Institution of Engineers (India).},

abstract={Identifying and diagnosing skin cancer using non-invasive techniques have gained momentum in recent years. Such analysis requires trained medical professionals and hence it has become more of subjective. This paper presents a method to quantify the asymmetries of skin lesion. It is achieved by identifying the variations of the RGB spectrum of skin lesion images using Six Sigma threshold as the preprocessor. These identifications are achieved based on the underlying principles of Shewhart's Control Charts, which focus on the fact that the variability does exist in all repetitive processes. The heterogeneous color variation within the skin is considered as an assignable cause and is due to the secretion of excess melanin. These variations possess greater magnitude as compared to the chance causes due to the color variations found in normal skins. Based on these color variations, image is segmented into different homogeneous regions and the borders of the diseased regions are identified. A novel method to quantify the symmetries of the ROI after extracting the border of the lesion is proposed. It is achieved by counting the number of border pixels falls either sides of all the possible axes passing through the center of mass of ROI and by calculating an Asymmetric Index (AI). Results show that the method produces robust border detection and also ascertains the existence of asymmetries in the images of different degree of malignancy.},

abstract={Extreme and deeper connectivity is being prescribed as the best course of action for enabling a wider variety of embedded devices to be smart in their actions and reactions. On one hand, consumer electronics, home utensils, household items, medical instruments, manufacturing machines, appliances, and gadgets are being internally empowered to be smart. Smartphone is one dazzling example. Another interesting trend is to enable these common, casual and cheap devices to connect with other devices in the vicinity for purpose interactions. In addition to that, devices are increasingly getting connected to the Cloud infrastructure. As more and more generic as well as specific services are being posited in cloud environments, the seamless and spontaneous connectivity with clouds go a long way in making embedded devices to be smarter in their offerings. How to make devices smart is the biggest challenge today. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a growing collection of methods and mechanisms for enabling compute machines to be cognitive in their dealings and results. Technology-induced automation is also being recommended overwhelmingly across the globe. Service orientation (SO) is a paradigm shift in bringing out a raft of automation facilities and features to IT systems and solutions. Device Profile for Web Services (DPWS) is a service oriented approach for device integration. The domain of our research interest is smart home and the specific focus area has been ambient assisted living (AAL). And using DPWS and Microsoft.NET micro-framework, we have created an errormonitoring and failsafe smart home for elderly people to live an independent yet technology-inspired satisfying life. This paper is for clearly explaining the problem, the solution design and implementation, challenges faced along the way from the problem to solution spaces, and the future enhancements. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Images play an important role in day to day life ranging from television coverage, Satellite communication to medical applications. Often images are corrupted due to unwanted signals called noise. Image denoising techniques can be effective in overcoming the unwanted disturbances between the pixels. Almost all algorithms in image processing use noise reduction techniques to extract data from image sensors to form the image. Sometimes the actual differences in pixel values may constitute real photographic detail which is often misinterpreted as noise. However, no algorithm can accurately distinguish between noise and artifacts which results in a tradeoff between removal of noise and preservation of fine details of the image. This paper aims to provide a thorough study on the various denoising models that can be instrumental in removing noise and obtaining a clear image. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={The Indian tractor industry is the largest in the world and nearly thirty to thirty-five percent of global production. India's current tractor penetration is estimated at twenty tractors per thousand hectares of agricultural land. A farmer's choice of tractor size is typically a trade-off between the utility of the tractor and its price; therefore fuel utilization in the tractor plays a key role. This paper discusses about efficient utilization of fuel in tractors. As the fuel prices increase and the procurement of tractors by Indian farmers increase efficient use of fuel becomes that much important. The present Indian tractor scenario and the expected growth rate of the tractor industry have been analyzed in detail. The comparative study between the conventional technology and the proposed technology has been discussed. The idea proposed in this paper is implementation of dual clutch transmission in tractors. Pre-selection of gears using electromagnetic actuators in dual clutch transmission has been explained in detail. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={In today's fast-paced society, waiting is not something most people tolerate well. As people work for longer hours, individuals have less leisure and families have fewer hours together, the pressure on people's time is greater than ever. In this environment, customers are looking for efficient, quick service with no wait. Organizations that make customers wait take the chance that they will lose business or at the very least that customers will be dissatisfied. Waiting lines, namely, queues occur whenever the number of arrivals at the facility exceeds the capacity of the system to process them. Queues are the symptom of unresolved capacity management problems. Customers can be more or less satisfied depending on how the wait is handled by the organization. The actual length of wait will affect how customers feel about their service experience. The type of wait namely, the standard queue versus a wait due to delay of service can also influence how customers will react. The study was made by collecting data from the customers of ICICI Bank Ltd., Tirchirappalli District and it resulted in a very small degree of dissatisfaction among the customers.},

abstract={This study proposes hybrid techniques which are based on Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm for data preprocessing and Fuzzy Extreme Learning Machine (FELM) classifier for an automatic detection of the Erythemato-Squamous Diseases (ESD). This ESDs require huge computational efforts to predict the diseases because almost all the six ESD diseases namely, psoriasis, lichen planus, seboreic dermatitis, pityriasis rubra pilaris, chronic dermatitis and pityriasis rosea have common features for more than 90%. In the recent survey it has been highlighted that, there are many machine learning algorithms performing better than the conventional techniques. In this study, we propose threshold based ABC-FELM algorithm which is used for both future extraction as well as the classifier to enhance the accuracy of the prediction of ESDs and computational time. Moreover, this hybrid mechanism is implemented and tested with 366 original patients' datasets. The threshold based data preprocessing reduces the dimensionality of the datasets considerably and hence it improves the time complexity. Finally, the proposed methodologies proved to be a potential solution for the diagnosis of ESD with significant improvement in computational time, namely less than 1 second and the accuracy (99.57%) compared to other models discussed in the recent literature. © 2013 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

abstract={Gas Insulated Substations (GIS) have found wide use in the past few decades. They offer several advantages over traditional Air Insulated Substations (AIS) which include superior dielectric strength, limited space requirements. Gas Insulated Busbar (GIB) is a critical part in a GIS since it serves as a component for tapping power for subsequent distribution to various interconnected components. Its failure would be detrimental and costly. Hence, manufacturers are faced with the task of minimizing the power loss in GIB. Standards stipulate stringent norms on the upper temperature rise limit for conductors and enclosures. Joule loss in a GIB is the primary source of heat for temperature rise and depends on the rated current, geometric dimension and resistivity. Further, skin-proximity effect results in a non-uniform current distribution leading to greater losses. This paper develops a 2-D finite element model of a GIB and employs magnetic analysis to estimate the power loss in the conductor and enclosure for rated current at maximum operating temperature. For the GIB taken up for study and analysis, losses are calculated using a theoretical method as per procedures laid out in CIGRE Working Group 21.12. The simulation and theoretical values are compared and cross-validated. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Modern day information age is enriched with the advanced network communication expertise but unfortunately at the same time encounters infinite security issues when dealing with secret and/or private information. The storage and transmission of the secret information become highly essential and have led to a deluge of research in this field. In this paper, an optimistic effort has been taken to combine graceful graph along with integer wavelet transform (IWT) to implement random image steganography for secure communication. The implementation part begins with the conversion of cover image into wavelet coefficients through IWT and is followed by embedding secret image in the randomly selected coefficients through graph theory. Finally stegoimage is obtained by applying inverse IWT. This method provides a maximum of 44 dB peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) for 266646 bits. Thus, the proposed method gives high imperceptibility through high PSNR value and high embedding capacity in the cover image due to adaptive embedding scheme and high robustness against blind attack through graph theoretic random selection of coefficients. © 2013 V.

abstract={This paper deals with novel Gabor based approach for Face Recognition. This method is the integration of Gabor based representation of face images and traditional method of Principal Complement Analysis (PCA). Gabor Wavelet first extracts the spatial frequency, spatial locality and orientation selectivity from faces irrespective of the variations in the expressions, illumination, pose etc., To overcome the high dimensionality problem, normalization of face images is unavoidable. PCA deals with the decomposition of the training set into the eigenvectors called Eigenfaces. Then by considering each Eigenfaces as each co-ordinate, a co-ordinate system is formed called Facespace. In this Facespace, each face is considered as a point. All samples in each class forms the cluster of points in the Facespace. By projecting each faces, its co-ordinate values can be determined, which are later used for distance measures in discrimination analysis. This Gabor based PCA approach is tested with FERET Database, ORL Database and acquired database of our department students called INSTRUMAX Database. This method is found to be more efficient than the traditional PCA as the number of images in the training set decreases. The Recognition Rate for various number of Feature vectors used for recognition are also analyzed. Moreover various Discrimination methods such as Euclidean, L1, L2, Cosine similarity are implemented and compared. © Research India Publications.},

By considering different possible structures of ATPCF, the impact of the different nonlinearity, group velocity dispersion, dissimilar effective mode area and different extinction coefficient contribution to the pulse dynamics and steering characteristics have been deeply investigated. In the linear regime, the proposed ATPCF designs, show symmetrical behavior for all the configurations, and robust to the structure induced asymmetry. On the other hand at nonlinear regime, the ATPCFs exhibit good switching contrast. As a consequence, we also observed that out of all configurations, ATPCF design of different radius with different index configuration exhibits a significant broadened wavelength spectrum. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={This report lays out the idea of introducing LPDC codes along with the spreading sequence to improve noise immunity of the signals traversing in wireless environment. With the need to make communication techniques efficient and reliable, spread spectrum has gained importance for its various added advantages. LDPC (Low Density Parity Check) have been gaining limelight in the past few years. Comprising of relatively faster encoding and decoding techniques, LDPC codes are capable of recovering the original message even after a large part of the message has been corrupted. To achieve lesser BER, spread spectrum concept has been used along with LDPC codes. In this paper, the signal was first spread and then the encoding and decoding algorithms were employed. The original message is finally recovered after de-spreading the signal. Features such as Approaching Shannon capacity, Good block error correcting performance, and Low error floor can be exploited by this technique. The presented idea would be applied to broadband wireless systems such as Wi-Fi and Wi-Max. This work demonstrates the suitability of LDPC along with spread spectrum technique in broad band wireless systems. © 2013 IEEE.},

Having understood the fact that significant savings can be availed and acquired with the assimilation and adoption of cloud concepts, business executives, entrepreneurs and engineers are working overtime in putting cloud-centric tactical as well as strategical plans and proposals in place to easily and quickly accomplish the lingering mantra of 'more with less'. Cloud infrastructures (private, public and hybrid) are erupting across the globe, cloud platforms, applications and services are being developed or assembled, deployed, managed, delivered via one or more of these cloud infrastructure providers. The popularity and pervasiveness of cloud services are quiet surging. Though cloud computing is being seen as a silver bullet for the ICT industry, there are a few shortcomings such as security, availability, data ownership, etc. In this study, we are concentrating on the perpetual and prominent security problem of the cloud paradigm.

abstract={We here propose a novel method for detecting and locating the human presence for controlling the power appliances in the subjected area. At the heart of our Endeavour, we use an over-head camera to capture the scene inside the concerned arena. From the scene we sample frames and process them to detect silhouette of objects. We then use a codebook instance as a reference to filter out human outline(s) to detect human. Their location in the room is traced using disparity calculation and subsequent depth extraction. Once the location has been estimated, the corresponding appliances can be operated accordingly for service. A controller interfacing can be provided to achieve the above. This is done using the serial communication technique with RS 232. Presence of max 232 IC guides the above. The serial communication is performed by specifying the port and baud rate of use and burning the needed code to perform the task. © 2005 - 2013 JATIT & LLS. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In this study, a hybrid TOA/RSSI wireless localization is proposed for accurate positioning in indoor UWB systems. The major problem in indoor localization is the effect of Non-Line of Sight (NLOS) propagation. To mitigate the NLOS effects, an unconstrained nonlinear optimization approach is utilized to process Time-of-Arrival (TOA) and Received Signal Strength (RSS) in the location system.TOA range measurements and path loss model are used to discriminate LOS and NLOS conditions. The weighting factors assigned by hypothesis testing, is used for solving the objective function in the proposed approach. This approach is used for describing the credibility of the TOA range measurement. Performance of the proposed technique is done based on MATLAB simulation. The result shows that the proposed technique performs well and achieves improved positioning under severe NLOS conditions. © Maxwell Scientific Organization, 2013.},

abstract={Protein-protein interactions are important in carrying out many biological processes and functions. These interactions may be either permanent or of temporary nature. Several studies have employed tools like solvent accessibility and graph theory to identify these interactions, but still more studies need to be performed to quantify and validate them. Although we now have many databases available with predicted and experimental results on protein-protein interactions, we still do not have many databases which focus on providing structural details of the interacting complexes, their oligomerisation state and homologues. In this work, protein-protein interactions have been thoroughly investigated within the structural regime and quantified for their strength using calculated pseudoenergies. The PPCheck server, an in-house webserver, has been used for calculating the pseudoenergies like van der Waals, hydrogen bonds and electrostatic energy based on distances between atoms of amino acids from two interacting proteins. PPCheck can be visited at http://caps.ncbs.res.in/ ppcheck/. Based on statistical data, as obtained by studying established protein-protein interacting complexes from earlier studies, we came to a conclusion that an average protein-protein interface consisted of about 51 to 150 amino acid residues and the generalized energy per residue ranged from -2 kJ mol-1 to -6 kJ mol-1. We found that some of the proteins have an exceptionally higher number of amino acids at the interface and it was purely because of their elaborate interface or extended topology i.e. some of their secondary structure regions or loops were either inter-mixing or running parallel to one another or they were taking part in domain swapping. Residue networks were prepared for all the amino acids of the interacting proteins involved in different types of interactions (like van der Waals, hydrogen-bonding, electrostatic or intramolecular interactions) and were analysed between the query domain-interacting partner pair and its remote homologue-interacting partner pair. We found that, in exceptional cases, homologous proteins belonging to the same superfamily, but with remote sequence similarity, can share similar interfaces. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013.},

Grossly, liver was the most affected organ in AFB<inf>1</inf> treated animals. Microscopically, vacuolar degeneration of hepatocytes, bile duct epithelial hyperplasia and hypertrophy and peribiliary fibrosis were consistently observed. Ultrastructurally, hepatocytes revealed varying degrees of degeneration, swollen endoplasmic reticulum and pleomorphism of mitochondria. OA produced significant nephrotoxicity with the pale, soft and enlarged kidneys showing discoloured foci over the surface. Microscopically, kidneys revealed degeneration of the proximal convoluted tubules and the testes were atrophic. Ultrastructurally, disruption of the mitochondrial membrane and swelling of the endoplasmic reticulum were observed. In group III, gross and histopathological changes were observed both in liver and kidneys and were of greater severity as compared to those of groups I and II. Ultrastructurally, hepatocytes revealed nuclear distortion, marginated heterochromatin, chromatolysis, electron opaque mitochondria with vacuolations and disarray of cristae and loss of cytoplasmic organelles.

abstract={Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) composed of huge number of tiny sensing nodes supporting computation and communication capabilities. The various applications of WSN include distributed computing, monitoring of weather, disaster management, target tracking, detecting encompassing conditions like temperature, sound and light. The major challenge in MAC protocol includes network infrastructures creation and sharing of communication patterns in an efficient manner. Researchers in the field of WSN highly focus on various techniques for energy efficiency to extend the network lifetime. Medium Access control (MAC) protocols used in WSN applications plays a vital role in conserving energy which leads to increase in lifetime. Large number of parameters influences the MAC protocol design. Factors influencing QoS and non QoS MAC protocols vary from one another. In this paper, MAC protocols of WSN are evaluated in terms of scalability, message passing, QoS support etc. These factors are analyzed and issues are emphasized so as to have a comparative study on both QoS and non QoS MAC protocols. MAC protocols like Sensor MAC (S-MAC), WiseMAC, D-Mac, T-MAC, Traffic Adaptive MAC, are considered under non QoS category and LEACH, P-SHIFT and DIFF MAC are the QoS based MAC protocols. With an extensive analysis of MAC protocols done in this paper, researchers can have better understanding of MAC protocol design for the application. © Research India Publications.},

Assuming the brain as a perfect fluid, the DNA coefficient between the biological and non-biological forms of the brain is calculated. These calculations are based on the Friedman density equations that describe the expansion or contraction of the universe in homogeneous and isotropic way in physical cosmology (only time independent equation is considered). We have tested this DNA coefficient with a sample size of eighty persons with belief constructs on consciousness behavior. The Pearson's coefficient thus obtained is then compared with DNA coefficient. A logical justification is made for the comparison of these two values. The coefficient values are found to tally but with an error margin of thirteen percent. The major result of this research study is in finding a relation between the experimental DNA values with that of psychology of consciousness behavior in terms of coefficient values.},

abstract={Tannery wastewater contains high organic loadings and other pollutants, making it challenging to be treated efficiently. A combined process involving both advance oxidation process and biological treatment seems to be the best solution to achieve the regulatory standard for discharge. This investigation reports on the degradation of tannery wastewater which was represented by the removal Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) using electrochemical process, biological degradation and finally, the combination of both processes. Electrolysis was carried out in batch reactor under different current density and dilution. Biological degradation was carried out with three isolated microbial strain and optimization of pH, nutrients, and growth factors were analyzed. The combined process involved an electrooxidation reactor connected to a column packed with immobilized biomass. Electrooxidation technique was found to obtain maximum percentage COD reduction in 73.1% at 1.5 A dm-2 using raw effluent. Bacillus Strain B proved to be superior in terms of COD reduction capabilities with a high 91.5% reduction with diluted wastewater. Biodegradation process was found to be most effective at pH 6. Intimate coupling of electro and biooxidation recorded good degradation for both raw and diluted samples, achieving 66.2 and 76.6% degradation, respectively. © 2013 © 2013 Balaban Desalination Publications.},

abstract={The glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are a family of enzymes involved in the detoxification of a wide range of chemicals, including important environmental carcinogens, as well as chemotherapeutic agents. In the present study 294 acute leukemia cases, comprising 152 of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and 142 of acute myeloid leukemia, and 251 control samples were analyzed for GSTM1 and GSTT1 polymorphisms through multiplex PCR methods. Significantly increased frequencies of GSTM1 null genotype (M0), GSTT1 null genotype (T0) and GST double null genotype (T0M0) were observed in the both ALL and AML cases as compared to controls. When data were analyzed with respect to clinical variables, increased mean levels of WBC, Blast %, LDH and significant reduction in DFS were observed in both ALL and AML cases with T0 genotype. In conclusion, absence of both GST M and GST T might confer increased risk of developing ALL or AML. The absence of GST enzyme might lead to oxidative stress and subsequent DNA damage resulting in genomic instability, a hallmark of acute leukemia. The GST enzyme deficiency might also exert impact on clinical prognosis leading to poorer DFS. Hence GST genotyping can be made mandatory in management of acute leukemia so that more aggressive therapy such as allogenic stem cell transplantation may be planned in the case of patients with a null genotype.},

abstract={Compartmentalization of the plasma membrane into lipid microdomains promotes efficient cellular processes by increasing local molecular concentrations. Calcium signaling, either as transients or propagating waves require integration of complex macromolecular machinery. Calcium waves represent a form of intercellular signaling in the central nervous system and the retina. We hypothesized that the mechanism for calcium waves would require effector proteins to aggregate at the plasma membrane in lipid microdomains. The current study shows that in Müller glia of the retina, proteins involved in calcium signaling aggregate in detergent resistant membranes identifying rafts and respond by redistributing on stimulation. We have investigated Purinoreceptor-1 (P2Y1), Ryanodine receptor (RyR), and Phospholipase C (PLC-β1). P2Y1, RyR and PLC-β1, redistribute from caveolin-1 and flotillin-1 positive fractions on stimulation with the agonists, ATP, 2MeS-ATP and Thapsigargin, an inhibitor of sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase (SERCA). Redistribution is absent on treatment with cyclopiazonic acid, another SERCA inhibitor. Disruption of rafts by removing cholesterol cause proteins involved in this machinery to redistribute and change agonist-induced calcium signaling. Cholesterol depletion from raft lead to increase in time to peak of calcium levels in agonist-evoked calcium signals in all instances, as seen by live imaging. This study emphasizes the necessity of a sub-population of proteins to cluster in specialized lipid domains. The requirement for such an organization at the raft-like microdomains may have implications on intercellular communication in the retina. Such concerted interaction at the rafts can regulate calcium dynamics and could add another layer of complexity to calcium signaling in cells. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The privatization and deregulation of electricity markets has a very large impact on almost all the power systems around the world. The underlying objective of introducing competition to these markets is to make them more efficient. A bilateral contract in an electricity market is an agreement between a willing buyer and a willing seller to exchange electricity, rights to generating capacity, or a related product under mutually agreeable terms for a specified period of time. This paper describes studies of optimal power dispatch in bilateral contracts by using Linear Programming Method with Line Flow Factors, Evolutionary Programming Technique and Differential Evolution Method. The line flow factors are evaluated from existing load flow studies. A generalized linear programming, Evolutionary Programming and Differential Evolution formulations are proposed to determine the optimal bilateral real power contracts under a deregulated environment subjected to the steady-state security constraints (e.g. generation and line flow limits). The standard data of Sample 4bus, two generators and two customers system has been taken into account and simulated with aid of MAT-lab software and comparative results was obtained. © 2013 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.},

abstract={The quality of a weld joint is highly influenced by depth of penetration. Hence, accurate prediction and maximization of depth of penetration is highly essential to ensure a good-quality joint. This paper highlights the development of neural network model for predicting depth of penetration and optimizing the process parameters for maximizing depth of penetration using simulated annealing algorithm. The process parameters chosen for the study are welding current, welding speed, gas flow rate and welding gun angle. The chosen output parameter was depth of penetration. The experiments were conducted based on design of experiments using fractional factorial with 125 runs. Using the experimental data, feed-forward backpropagation neural network model was developed and trained using Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. It was found that ANN model based on network 4-15-1 predicted depth of penetration more accurately. A mathematical model was also developed correlating the process parameters with depth of penetration for doing optimization. A source code was developed in MATLAB to do the optimization. The optimized process parameters gave a value of 3. 778 mm for depth of penetration. © 2011 Springer-Verlag London Limited.},

abstract={Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have been found to be a robust tool to model many non-linear hydrological processes. The present study aims at evaluating the performance of ANN in simulating and predicting ground water levels in the uplands of a tropical coastal riparian wetland. The study involves comparison of two network architectures, Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) trained under five algorithms namely Levenberg Marquardt algorithm, Resilient Back propagation algorithm, BFGS Quasi Newton algorithm, Scaled Conjugate Gradient algorithm, and Fletcher Reeves Conjugate Gradient algorithm by simulating the water levels in a well in the study area. The study is analyzed in two cases-one with four inputs to the networks and two with eight inputs to the networks. The two networks-five algorithms in both the cases are compared to determine the best performing combination that could simulate and predict the process satisfactorily. Ad Hoc (Trial and Error) method is followed in optimizing network structure in all cases. On the whole, it is noticed from the results that the Artificial Neural Networks have simulated and predicted the water levels in the well with fair accuracy. This is evident from low values of Normalized Root Mean Square Error and Relative Root Mean Square Error and high values of Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency Index and Correlation Coefficient (which are taken as the performance measures to calibrate the networks) calculated after the analysis. On comparison of ground water levels predicted with those at the observation well, FFNN trained with Fletcher Reeves Conjugate Gradient algorithm taken four inputs has outperformed all other combinations. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={Objective: The objective was to evaluate the protective effect of ellagic acid against experimentally induced cardiac arrhythmias, hypertrophy and its association with altered lipid metabolism during myocardial infarction in rats. Methods: Rats were treated with ellagic acid (7.5 and 15 mg/kg) orally for a period of 10 days. After 10 days of pretreatment, isoproterenol (100 mg/kg) was injected subcutaneously at an interval of 24 h for 2 days to induce myocardial infarction. On the 12th day, the cardiac rhythm was observed. The rats were sacrificed and the heart was isolated from each rat. Ventricular hypertrophy and myocardial necrotic scores were analysed in the myocardium. Lipid peroxidation products in the plasma were analysed. Changes in the lipid profile were measured using the plasma and heart tissue homogenates of normal and experimental rats. Results: Isoproterenol-induced rats showed arrhythmias, hypertrophy and increased levels of myoglobin, creatine kinase-MB, lipid peroxidation products compared to the normal control rats. Ventricular hypertrophy and increased myocardial necrotic scores were observed in isoproterenol-induced rats. Oral pretreatment with ellagic acid restored pathological arrhythmias, ventricular hypertrophy, lipid peroxidation, altered lipid profile and myocardial necrosis in the isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarcted rats. Conclusions: Oral pretreatment with ellagic acid was safe and effective in cardio protection against ISO-induced arrhythmias, hypertrophy and myocardial necrosis. Anti lipid peroxidation property and anti hyperlipidaemic activity through 3-hydroxy-3 methyl glutaryl CoA reductase inhibition by ellagic acid may be the reasons for the beneficial action of ellagic acid against experimentally induced myocardial infarction. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={In order to ascertain whether autistic children display characteristic metabolic signatures that are of diagnostic value, plasma amino acid analyses were carried out on a cohort of 138 autistic children and 138 normal controls using reverse-phase HPLC. Pre-column derivatization of amino acids with phenyl isothiocyanate forms phenyl thio-carbamate derivates that have a λmax of 254 nm, enabling their detection using photodiode array. Autistic children showed elevated levels of glutamic acid (120 ± 89 vs. 83 ± 35 μmol/L) and asparagine (85 ± 37 vs. 47 ± 19 μmol/L); lower levels of phenylalanine (45 ± 20 vs. 59 ± 18 μmol/L), tryptophan (24 ± 11 vs. 41 ± 16 μmol/L), methionine (22 ± 9 vs. 28 ± 9 μmol/L) and histidine (45 ± 21 vs. 58 ± 15 μmol/L). A low molar ratio of (tryptophan/large neutral amino acids) × 100 was observed in autism (5.4 vs 9.2), indicating lesser availability of tryptophan for neurotransmitter serotonin synthesis. To conclude, elevated levels of excitatory amino acids (glutamate and asparagine), decreased essential amino acids (phenylalanine, tryptophan and methionine) and decreased precursors of neurotransmitters (tyrosine and tryptophan) are the distinct characteristics of plasma amino acid profile of autistic children. Thus, such metabolic signatures might be useful tools for early diagnosis of autism. © 2013 National Institute of Science Communication and Information Resources (NISCAIR). All rights reserved.},

abstract={Neuropathic pain is a chronic neurodegenerative disease. It is well characterized by spontaneous pain, hyperalgesia, hypothesia, dysesthesia and allodynia. The present study was designed to investigate the antinociceptive potential of Butea monosperma on vincristine-induced painful neuropathy in rats. Vincristine was administered for induction of neuropathic pain in experimental animals. Hot plate, acetone drop, paw pressure, Von Frey hair and tail immersion tests were performed to assess the degree of thermal hyperalgesia, cold chemical allodynia, mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia in the hind paw and tail thermal hyperalgesia, respectively, as an index of peripheral and central pain sensation. Tissue thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARSs), reduced glutathione (GSH) and total calcium levels were estimated to assess the biochemical changes in the sciatic nerve tissue. Microscopically, histopathological changes were also observed in the sciatic nerve tissue. Ethanolic extract of B. monosperma leaves and pregabalin were administered for 14 consecutive days. Vincristine administration resulted in significant reduction in behavioural (i.e. hyperalgesia and allodynic pain sensation) changes along with a rise in the levels of TBARS, total calcium and decrease in GSH levels when compared with the normal control group. Moreover, significant histological changes were also observed. Pretreatment with B. monosperma significantly attenuated vincristine-induced development of painful behavioural, biochemical and histological changes in a dose-dependent manner, which is similar to that of pregabalin-pretreated group. B. monosperma ameliorated vincristine-induced painful neuropathy. It may be due to its potential of antioxidative, neuroprotective and calcium channel inactivation. © 2012, SAGE Publications.

abstract={Lineage-committed Teffectors generated in response to Ag during the inflammatory phase are destined to die during termination of the immune response.We present evidence to suggest that molecular signatures of lineage commitment are reflected in apoptotic cascades activated in CD4+ T effectors. Exemplifying this, ablation of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) protected effector-memory T (TEM) cells, but not TNaive or central-memory T cells, activated in vitro, from apoptosis triggered by cytokine deprivation. Furthermore, attrition of T effectors generated in the secondary, but not the primary, response to Ag was substantially reduced in mice, which received iNOS inhibitors. Distinct patterns of iNOS expression were revealed in wild-type TEM effectors undergoing apoptosis, and ablation of iNOS protein in primary and TEM wild-type effectors confirmed observations made in iNOS-/- cells. Describing molecular correlates of this dependence, mitochondrial damage, activation of the protein Bax, and release from mitochondria of the apoptosis-inducing factor were selectively abrogated in iNOS-/- TEM effectors. Suggesting that iNOS dependence was linked to the functional identity of T cell subsets, both iNOS induction and apoptosis were compromised in IFN-γ-/- TEM effectors, which mirrored the response patterns of iNOS-/- TEM. Collectively, these observations suggest that programs regulating deletion and differentiation are closely integrated and likely encoded during lineage commitment of T effectors.

abstract={The role of cytoskeleton-associated proteins during TNF-induced apoptosis is not fully understood. A potential candidate kinase that might connect TNF signaling to actin reorganization is the deathassociated protein kinase (DAPK). To identify new DAPK interaction partners in TNF-induced apoptosis, we performed a peptide array screen. We show that TNF-treatment enhanced the phosphorylation of LIMK at threonine508 and its downstream target cofilin at serine3 (p-cofilinSer3). Modulation of DAPK activity and expression by DAPK inhibitor treatment, siRNA knockdown, and overexpression affected the phosphorylation of both proteins. We propose a 3D structural model where DAPK functions as a scaffold for the LIMK/cofilin complex and triggers a closer interaction of both proteins under TNF stimulation. Upon TNF a striking redistribution of LIMK, DAPK, and cofilin to the perinuclear compartment was observed. The pro-apoptotic DAPK/LIMK/cofilin multiprotein complex was abrogated in detached cells, indicating that its signaling was no longer needed if cells committed to apoptosis. P-cofilinSer3 was strongly accumulated in cells with condensed chromatin, pronounced membrane blebs and Annexin V up-regulation. From studying different cofilinSer3 mutants we suggest that p-cofilinSer3 is an indicator of TNF-induced apoptosis. Collectively, our findings identify a novel molecular cytoskeleton-associated mechanism in TNF-induced DAPK-dependent apoptosis. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The present work focuses on the development of phenomenological model for the bio-syngas to methane conversion process. One dimensional heterogeneous and pseudo-homogeneous model were simulated for a typical pilot plant scale fixed bed methanator processing 55 mol/h of CO (total molar flow rate of 310 mol/h) with inlet composition of H2/CO = 3, CO2/CO = 1, CH 4/CO = 0.5 at 550 K and 1 atm. Performance of the fixed bed reactor at different operating conditions like CO2/CO ratio, H2/CO ratio, effect of H2O in the feed was studied. It was found that for feeds that were not pre-enriched with hydrogen, presence of water and water gas shift activity was found to decrease the catalyst inventory substantially. CO2 in the inlet feed stream would help to decrease the temperature due to dilution effect and more importantly, can be chosen to maximize methane yield per mole of CO converted. Further, the model was simulated to predict the performance characteristics of reactor with a mixture containing two types of catalyst, one of them being specifically added to increase H2/CO ratio in feed through water gas shift reaction. The work also laid the importance of incorporating pore diffusion and external mass transfer locally in the computation of actual catalyst inventory and reactor volume. The work was useful in selection of operating window and assessing the various viable options for an industrial reactor. The model developed will serve in selection of operability window for commercialization of substitute natural gas synthesis (SNG) process. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Summary. Methanolic extract of Eugenia jambolana leaves was investigated for their Hepatoprotective potentials against liver injury induced by CCl4 in rats. The liver damage was induced in male albino rats (200-220 g) by administering CCl4 (1ml/kg) for 7 days and the extent of damage was studied by assessing the biochemical parameters such as total bilirubin, serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT), serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total protein (TP), albumin and globulin. Histopathological changes of liver sample were compared with respective control. The oral treatment of rats with methanolic extract of Eugenia jambolana at the dose 200 mg/kg for 7 days resulted in significant hepatoprotection for total protein (6.6 g/dl) only, while at 400 mg/kg, the restoration was significant for enzyme markers, viz. SGOT, SGPT, ALP (22.5 U/L, 18.5 U/L, 58.5 U/L) in CCl4-treated rats. The maximum tolerated dose of the extract was found to be greater than 3000 mg/kg, p.o. Thus from the present study it was concluded that methanolic extracts of Eugenia jambolana leaves is having hepatoprotective effect against CCl4 induced liver injury. Industrial relevance. The present study affords evidence on hepatoprotection by Eugenia jambolana leaves against carbon tetrachloride, a toxic air contaminant responsible for hepatic and renal toxicity. This is a preliminary study and this will support us in isolating the biological active phyto-constituents for treating hepatic disorders. The outcome of this study will help in discovering a new or active phytochemicals and thus create a novel hepatoprotective moiety with less adverse effect for the betterment of the human society. © 2012.

abstract={Parallel Manipulator has lot of applications in areas like flight/automobile simulators, earthquake simulators, milling machine, etc. Main disadvantage of parallel manipulator is the presence of singularities within the workspace. Due to this, entire workspace of a parallel manipulator cannot be used effectively. To overcome this disadvantage, an automated selective activation mechanism is proposed, designed and fabricated using solenoids, gear train and belt drive arrangement. By using this mechanism interior singularity are crossed and this enables the user to utilize the entire workspace. Selective activation mechanism with automation ability is designed in such a way that, depending on activation of solenoid, active joint of manipulator changes from one position to another, which subsequently changes the singularity curves. By changing active joint positions, 4 ways of operating manipulator are identified. For all type of operations, singularity curves are plotted using MATLAB. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Metal-flavonoid complexes have elicited much attention in recent years due to their enhanced pharmacological activities when compared with their parent flavonoid and hence have the potential to be used as therapeutic agents. The membrane interactions and localization of these molecules will determine their role as a clinically relevant therapeutic molecule. Hesperidin is a flavone glycoside present in citrus plants. In the present work, a room temperature synthesis of hesperidin-copper complex was carried out and its interactions with membranes were investigated on a self-assembled nano-dimensional lipid bilayer membrane using electrochemical techniques. The results reveal that the copper complex interacts strongly at the membrane-electrolyte interface and localizes in the outer bilayer leaflet in a dose-dependent manner causing extensive membrane fluidization. When incubated with erythrocytes, hesperidin-copper complex initiated eryptosis and triggered formation of echinocytes by disrupting the actin cytoskeletal network because of its surface interaction. The parent flavonoid did not show such extensive membrane perturbation effects which may be attributed to their deeper penetration. The hesperidin-copper complex exhibits lower anti-oxidant activity when compared with hesperidin. These alterations in the mode of interaction of hesperidin-copper complex compared with their parent flavonoid may influence their pharmacological activities. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={Detergents might affect membrane protein structures by promoting intramolecular interactions that are different from those found in native membrane bilayers, and fine-tuning detergent properties can be crucial for obtaining structural information of intact and functional transmembrane proteins. To systematically investigate the influence of the detergent concentration and acyl-chain length on the stability of a transmembrane protein structure, the stability of the human glycophorin A transmembrane helix dimer has been analyzed in lyso-phosphatidylcholine micelles of different acyl-chain length. While our results indicate that the transmembrane protein is destabilized in detergents with increasing chain-length, the diameter of the hydrophobic micelle core was found to be less crucial. Thus, hydrophobic mismatch appears to be less important in detergent micelles than in lipid bilayers and individual detergent molecules appear to be able to stretch within a micelle to match the hydrophobic thickness of the peptide. However, the stability of the GpA TM helix dimer linearly depends on the aggregation number of the lyso-PC detergents, indicating that not only is the chemistry of the detergent headgroup and acyl-chain region central for classifying a detergent as harsh or mild, but the detergent aggregation number might also be important. © 2012 Biophysical Society.},

abstract={Equi-Channel Angular Pressing(ECAP) involves development of large simple shear which induces plastic deformation on the sample pressed through a die containing two intersecting channels of identical cross-section. The channel angle in ECAP die is having significant influence to induce the strain on the material during pressing. The strain imposed on the material increases while channel angle decreases. On another hand, the imparted strain increases with increase in hydrostatic pressure. The relation between hydrostatic pressure and channel angle is not communal because hydrostatic pressure decreases with increase in channel angle. Hence, it is clear that channel angle plays an influencing factor for inducing strain on the material and also hydrostatic pressure determination based on channel angle. Therefore a compromise solution has to be selected in determining the channel angle for achieving effective ECAP condition.The influence of channel angle on deformation behavior for AA 6061 Aluminum Alloy using ANSYS V12 was studied. The Analysis is carried out for different channel angles of 90°, 110° and 120° for different hydrostatic pressure conditions. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={An estimation method based on RP-HPLC has been identified for determining the concentrations of pantoprazole sodium and mosapride citrate in combined pharmaceutical formulation. The experiment was performed on Hypersil BDS (4.6mm×150nm), 5μm column in isocratic mode, with 1 mL/min flow of orthophosphoric acid adjusted, mobile phase consisting of a 40:60 mixture of mixed sodium phosphate buffer (0.007M) and acetonitrile of pH 4. A UV detector was used with the measurement of absorption at 278 nm. The method resulted in retention times of 2.803 minutes and 5.167 minutes for pantoprazole sodium and mosapride citrate respectively. The method was validated according to ICH guidelines for system suitability parameters, linearity, precision, accuracy, specificity, ruggedness, robustness. Recoveries of pantoprazole and mosapride were found to be in the range of 99.77% ± 0.23% and 99.44% ± 0.50%. Linearity was observed in the range of 5-30 μg/mL and 1.9-11.4 μg/mL for pantoprazole and mosapride respectively. The LOD for pantoprazole sodium and were Mosapride citrate determined to be 0.1599 μg/mL and 0.1790μg/mL respectively, while LOQ for these were respectively 0.4894 μg/mL and 0.5480 μg/mL. As, all the parameters of ICH guidelines for validation are satisfied, this method is suitable for the simultaneous estimation of pantoprazole sodium and mosapride citrate in combined pharmaceutical formulations.},

abstract={Obesity is a chronic disease of increasing prevalence in most countries, which leads to substantial increase in morbidity and mortality in association with insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases. A variety of plant species have been found to have beneficial effects on health. This study was designed to determine the anti-obesity potential of aqueous fruit extract of Carica papaya L. on high fat cafeteria diet (HFD) fed obese rats. The rats were divided into six groups, each comprising of six animals: Normal Diet (ND), High Fat Diet (HFD), HFD plus fruit extract (200mg/kg b.w.), HFD plus fruit extract (400mg/kg b.w.), HFD plus fruit extract (600mg/kg b.w.) and HFD plus standard drug, Orlistat (50 mg/kg b.w.). After the treatment period of 45 days, the animals were sacrificed, blood and tissues were collected and various biochemical parameters were analyzed. The results showed that the BMI, body weight, organ weight of the liver, kidney and spleen were significantly decreased in the treated groups than in the HFD group animals. Serum Glucose, Triglycerides, Total cholesterol, LDL-Cholesterol and VLDL-Cholesterol were significantly decreased while HDL-Cholesterol was elevated in the treated groups in a dose-dependent manner as compared to the HFD group. Elevated hepatic triglycerides, total cholesterol, free fatty acid and phospholipid levels were also significantly reduced in the treated groups. Furthermore, administration of fruit extract of Carica papaya L. produced a significant inhibition of MDA production and a significant increase in GSH and activity of SOD. In conclusion, these results suggest that aqueous fruit extract of Carica papaya L. could be useful in the treatment of obesity and related disorders.},

abstract={Man began inventing machines to do his work and ultimately, he became lazy. The idea proposed by us in this paper is bound to make him even more so. As we all know, the field of robotics is very modern and there can be surplus amount of research that can be enlisted with relation to that. Another such area is image processing. Digital image processing is a very profound key that can change the outlook of many designs and proposals. Our idea in this paper is to couple both these technologies and serve many applications that can benefit mankind and can make lifestyle even easier. These applications can be further extended with the help of sensors. Of the many sensors that can be used, we are going to explore the merits of coupling an optical sensor that can be put a variety of uses. With the help of sensors and image processing technique we aim in giving artificial intelligence another limb to work with. The applications of such a combined mechanism are limitless and this can be further brought to practical usage if given the right resources. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Semisolid preparations for external application to skin have gained much demand, since it is easily absorbed through the skin layers. Many novel topical dosage forms have been discovered, among which organogels appears to play an important role. Organogels are thermodynamically stable, biocompatible, isotropic gel, which not only give localised effect, but also systemic effect through percutaneous absorption. Although different types of gelator molecules are being used for the development of organogels, both egg and soya lecithin are mainly focused. The purity of lecithin is also considered to be an important factor in gelation. Apart from lecithin, non-ionic surfactant based microemulsion gels and pluronic organogels are also being developed. Compared to conventional topical dosage forms, these novel formulations are found to be more advantageous and efficient. In future, organogels can give way to many promising discoveries in the field of topical dosage forms. The current review aims at giving an idea about organogels, its applications and importance in topical delivery. © 2012 IJDDR, Vedha Hari. B. N et al.},

This Modulation scheme includes the data dependency check before the spatial multiplexing. The proposed data dependency check allows efficient selection of antennas for parallel transmission of data. The Fractional bit encoding is modulus conversion scheme which convert the incoming bit stream to numbers in an arithmetic base, or modulus, that is not a power of 2. When applied to SM, FBE results in a more versatile system design allowing transmitter to be equipped with an arbitrary number of antennas for a wider range of spectral efficiencies given restrictions on space and power consumption.

abstract={There are many applications which require complete coverage and obstacle avoidance. The classical A* algorithm provides the user a shortest path by avoiding the obstacle. As well, the Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path between the source and destination. But in many applications we require complete coverage of the proposed area with obstacle avoidance. There are LSP, LSSP, BSA, spiral-STC and Complete Coverage D* algorithms which do not realize complete (100%) coverage. The complete coverage using a critical point algorithm assures complete coverage, but it is not well suited for applications like mine detection. Also for covering the missed region it keeps the obstacle as a critical point which is not advisable in critical applications where obstacle may be a dangerous one. To overcome this and to achieve the complete coverage we propose a novel graph traversal algorithm Traversal Algorithm for Complete Coverage (TRACC). Here the area to be scanned is decomposed into a finite number of cells. The traversal is done through all the cells after making sure the next cell has no obstacle. TRACC assures thorough coverage of the proposed area and ensuring that all the obstacles are avoided. Hence the TRACC always have the safer path while covering the entire area. It also reports the obstacle placed or blocked cell. © 2012 Science Publications.},

abstract={Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is the well growing technology in the fields of defence, industrial automation, building automation, environmental forecasting, asset management, health care etc. In WSN, each and every node should be secured and this security is achieved by secure group communication. There are many key management techniques used to implement group communication in a secured manner but the key distribution is always being an issue in WSN because of limited capabilities and vulnerable nature of WSN. The proposed WSN totally uses three sort of keys namely Master key, session key and pair wise keys for secured communication are used in WSN. The main goal is to provide secured node to node communication by using efficient pair wise keying mechanism and it uses secret code for secure communication. It provides the better robustness, authentication and more security. The proposed WSN architecture has two hierarchy layers known as H end and L end sensor layers in a cluster. Secured communication between Low end node (L) to Low end node (L) and High end node (H) to High end node (H) follows efficient pair wise keying mechanism. To establish secured communication between Low end node (L) to High end node (H) and Cluster Head (CH) to Cluster Head (CH), new node key should be established before establishing pair wise keying mechanism. Master key is established for the broadcasting of Base Station (BS) to all other nodes. In performance analysis, computation, communication and storage cost are calculated and analysed. © 2012 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

abstract={Agriculture is the backbone of Indian Economy. Because without agriculture living is impossible since agriculture produces the main source of food for us. But in today's situation the availability of labour for carrying out agricultural activities is rare. The automation in all kind of industries leads to industrial growth. Here agricultural process is automated. In this proposed system all the machines to work on its own with the help of inputs received from the sensors which are monitoring the agricultural land round the clock and a single person is enough to monitor whether everything going normal. The entire process is controlled and monitored by programmable logic controller. Above process is transmitted to the user using ZigBee network. Agricultural process involves seeding, ploughing, irrigation, planting, fertilizing, weeding, harvesting. Here three processes can be implemented. The main objective is even a professionals can work in the agricultural field. This idea is implemented in future there is remarkable change in the agricultural field. In general the manual cultivation for one acre of land requires money of around Rs. 15,000-17,000 but due to this technique we reduce the cost and is nearly Rs. 9,000-10,000 only and also the yield is high when compared to normal one. © 2012 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

abstract={In music there are many types of modifications that are done on the sounds such as filters, overdrive, dynamics, volume, pitch and ambience. The noise gate is one such effect which falls under the category of dynamics. Noise gate is something which helps in cutting of unwanted sounds be it below a certain level or be it at a particular decibel level. The level from which it can be cut off or from which it should be cut off is called the threshold level. There are three main functions that are present in a noise gate-threshold, attack, decay. The attack and the decay levels can be pre programmed or controlled by different equipment. Let us say that the attack levels are the same as what it is programmed in the other stomp boxes, effects or amplifiers or all three put together. The value of attack does not affect the noise gate. Our primary concern is to attenuate the unwanted sounds that are being generated. © 2012 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

abstract={In forging and rolling industries, the furnace is used for melting. The temperature of the furnace is controlled by supplying air-fuel combination, flow of electron, inflow of coal etc. Depends on the type of furnace it will vary. The temperature is measured by using pyrometer type sensors or any contact type sensors. Fully automated furnace, temperature is measured and transmitted to control room through a wired connection. Similarly control on furnace also carried out by wired connections from the control room. In wired network, transmission between control room and furnace and vice versa needs lengthy and confusing wire connections. Installation cost is also high. In this proposed study, the amplified value of the temperature sensor is transmitted to the controller unit by radio frequency waves. For transmission highly secured XBee is used. The controller unit receives the temperature serially by using another XBee module. The controller unit displays the temperature locally. Controlling value of the flow of electrons is transmitted to another controller using the XBee module. So that temperature of the furnace is maintained with ±1°C. In the entire process LPC2148 processor is used. By implementing this technique accident due to operator carelessness can be reduced. This technique is easy to implement and also acquired at low cost. © 2012 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

abstract={Nanofluids were prepared successfully by dispersing oleic acid stabilized, non-spherical CuO nano-structures in a high-viscous, high-boiling thermic fluid (Therminol®55). The optimum probe ultra-sonication time was determined through measurement of thermal conductivity as a function of ultrasonication time. Reproducibility of viscosity and thermal conductivity measurements confirmed colloidal stability even at temperature up to 140 °C. A maximum thermal conductivity enhancement of 15.6% was obtained at 100 °C with CuO concentration of 0.32 vol%, which could be attributed to Brownian motion. Above 60 °C, the thermal conductivity ratios are higher than relative viscosity which suggests the potency of CuO-Therminol®55 nanofluid as potential thermic fluid for industrial applications.

abstract={An economic design of water distribution system components plays an important role in the water-supplying agency because of the requirement of a large financial investment on construction, operation, and maintenance. Population-based stochastic search algorithms have become a futuristic method for optimal design of water distribution networks. However, the effectiveness of population-based stochastic search algorithms purely depends on several factors, such as population size, degree of randomness involved, penalty function, algorithm operators, and search space size. An analysis of published research shows that a large number of evaluations is required to arrive at the least cost combination of pipe diameters. This paper proposes a new approach, in which flow velocity in a pipe is considered as implicit information for pipe sizing. Three well-known benchmark networks were used to illustrate the applicability of the proposed approach for least-cost pipe sizing of water distribution networks. The result of the model application reveals that the computational effort required to arrive at an economical design is very minimal. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract={Since the performance of portable electronic products increases continuously with demand, there is a need for low power digital VLSI design. Due to limited backup time of batteries, the operating time of portable electronic products is highly restricted. So the designers now concentrate on low power rather than the speed of the device or system. We implement a frequency divider (prescaler) using different flavors like conventional CMOS logic, pass transistor logic and transmission gate logic styles. Electronic Computer Aided Design (CAD) tools like Micro wind and a DSCH are used in our simulations by which the comparison of power in each style is provided. Micro wind is used a layout editor and DSCH (Digital Schematic) is used as a schematic editor. Results show that the pass transistor logic consumes less power with minimum area and good performance.

abstract={The Element Management System (EMS) is one that is involved in the development of the functionalities of efficient management of network elements like the DSLAMs that handles high speed digital data streams from numerous subscribers, end users and the network service providers. DSLAM is a broadband access network element that supports multiple DSL transmission types (xDSL) and finds advantageous as it provides an efficient way of broadcasting with reliability and scalability and its support to triple play delivery (audio, video and voice supporting). The essence of EMS is to research with network management system (EMS GUI) that provides configuration, maintenance and the FCAPS (Fault management, Configuration management, Accounting management, Security management) management of the network element. This flexibility ensures the enhanced deployment of novel Network Element (NE) releases, enabling high penetration in market for new services. EMS manages the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) configuration of DSLAMs as being supported by the integration of multiple types of media. There are SIP versions for the hardware of DSLAMs which evolve in parallel, most of the times independently. Generally, the design of the application will have core component and on top of the plugins that are defined for each version of the hardware release. SIP application is like having SIP core and SIP plugins for each DSLAM version which results in making frequent releases of all of these components on every introduction of a new SIP version. This results in lot of cost involvement, every time developing and making releases of the SIP core and plugins. So, the current design of SIP core application and plugins need to be revisited to reduce the redelivery of all of them for each new SIP version thus providing an optimal design of SIP application. The optimal design of SIP application is obtained by moving the SIP components to the SIP core and making a deviant from the plugins that is dependent of each SIP plugins for the new SIP versions that is being introduced. The former is removed from its content thus breaking the link between the plugins and the core for the updation of the new SIP versions. As a result on introduction of every new SIP version the SIP core to be redelivered to the customer instead of redelivering the entire former SIP core and the SIP plugins as both has a dependency for the new SIP version thus resulting in higher performance and cost effective. © Medwell Journals, 2012.},

abstract={Assessment of the healthiness of insulation in transformers is a vital aspect for power system utilities since most in-service transformers which form the crux of the power system have reached its lifetime duration. Among many factors, moisture and ageing significantly influence the dielectric properties of a transformer. Recently, several researchers have proposed new diagnostic methods that are complementary to the classical measurement systems such as insulation resistance, power frequency dissipation factor, polarization index measurements etc. Dielectric diagnosis with polarization and depolarization currents (PDC) uses the dielectric system response in time domain. In this research a laboratory-built, compact and easy to construct PDC measurement system is implemented without compromising on the reliability of the measurement system. The capability of the measuring system is ascertained by carrying out detailed studies on scaled down laboratory models and a 315 kVA, 11kV/433V, Dyn 11, ONAN distribution transformer with artificially simulated insulation flaws namely moisture content in oil, inter-disc/inter-turn shorts, winding asymmetry etc. Simulation studies on the transformer R-C equivalent representation are also carried out to validate the response of the PDC system. In addition, the Homoscedastic Probabilistic Neural Network (HOPNN) which utilized the Expectation Maximization (EM) with the Maximum Likelihood (ML) algorithm is implemented for obtaining a parsimonious training for subsequent identification of faults. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Electrical treeing is one of the significant causes for degradation of solid insulating materials, particularly in polymer and power cable insulation. It is an established fact that the extent of treeing in insulators is strongly related to the type of the dielectric material and the nature of flaw. In this research, detailed studies are carried out to investigate the electrical tree growth characteristics due to the effect of barrier in a composite polymeric insulation system, using a needle-plane electrode model. Laboratory studies have been conducted with a constant alternating voltage supply at power frequency (50 Hz) on composite virgin polymeric insulation specimen made up of two layers of Poly Methyl Meth Acrylate (PMMA) and an intermediate high permittivity layer of mica which acts as a barrier for tree growth. Electrical tree initiation and propagation is analyzed in relation to Partial Discharge (PD) signatures acquired from the PD measurement system and by correlating the physical aspects of degradation due to tree morphological structure. PD patterns during tree growth are analyzed in correlation with PD signatures with and without barrier. Phase resolved patterns of PD signatures obtained from the acquisition system are preprocessed and unique features are extracted based on statistical operators which in turn forms the input to the proposed Adaptive Probabilistic Neural Network (APNN) for discrimination of 'tree' and 'no-tree' patterns.

abstract={The application of the bio-control agent is on a significant rise in the current agricultural practices. Besides causing no harm to the external environment, these compounds also help in controlling the growth of pathogens. In this study, we have compared the efficiency of Trichoderma viride which is being used in the field over the past few years as a bio-control agent, with the novel Streptomyces species IF5 (GenBank Accession number FJ951435) by analysing the secondary metabolites for anti-microbial activity under various environmental conditions. Several tests were performed to quantify the effect of the metabolites produced from both the strains under varying pH, salt concentration, heavy metals and pesticide endosulfan. We found that the activity of enzymes produced by Streptomyces IF5 was significantly higher than that of Trichoderma viride and also Streptomyces IF5 could tolerate severe environmental stresses more efficiently as compared to Trichoderma viride. Our results suggest that Streptomyces IF5 can be used in place of Trichoderma viride as an effective bio-control agent. The mass production of these metabolites from Streptomyces IF5 and the mode of application on the field however have to be investigated further and the conditions are to be optimized, which would be the future direction of the present study.},

abstract={Financial literacy is the ability of the individual to make appropriate financial decisions personally. The ability includes understanding the financial products, financial concepts, discussing the financial problems, making choices between managing, spending and saving money and responding to the current reforms in financial market. With the increased risk of global markets and introduction of more innovative financial products, investors are required to make well informed decisions with their money. So, financial Literacy had gained its importance across the globe. The objective of the study is to analyse the influence of the financial literacy level on individual investment decisions. A sample of 469 investors from Tiruchirapalli was selected by way of stratified random sampling method. The primary data collected were analysed with the help of percentage analysis and chi-square test using MS Excel. The result shows that except the gender, there are relationships between the socio-economic factors and the level of financial literacy possessed by the respondents. Following the age and health, responsibilities come as a third factor, which is clubbed with the family commitments. This clearly states that our Indian society is always built based on love and affection bound with generations.},

abstract={The curiosity of human on wireless devices is expanding exorbitantly, emphasizing high data rates and band width requirements. Multiband Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (MB-OFDM) is the technique that victuals high data rate. Studies manifests that most of the licensed bands are not exercised in an efficient way thereby leading to the progression of cognitive radio which allows the secondary users to access and activate the free band of primary users. Moreover, sensing the free holes is the prior concern in CR cycle. With the existence of diverse spectrum sensing methods each with its own pros and cons, this study is mainly subjected about the enhancement of energy detection method owing to its ease, simplicity and monotony. The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) block of the above method is replaced with Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) as it can operate in both time and frequency domains. Four wavelet families are discussed in this study.

abstract={Introduction: A thorough understanding of the cellular and muscle fiber orientation in left ventricular cardiac tissue is of paramount importance for the generation of artificial cardiac patches to treat the ischemic myocardium. The major challenge faced during cardiac patch engineering is to choose a perfect combination of three entities; cells, scaffolds and signaling molecules comprising the tissue engineering triad for repair and regeneration. Areas covered: This review provides an overview of various scaffold materials, their mechanical properties and fabrication methods utilized in cardiac patch engineering. Stem cell therapies in clinical trials and the commercially available cardiac patch materials were summarized in an attempt to provide a recent perspective in the treatment of heart failure. Various tissue engineering strategies employed thus far to construct viable thick cardiac patches is schematically illustrated. Expert opinion: Though many strategies have been proposed for fabrication of various cardiac scaffold materials, the stage and severity of the disease condition demands the incorporation of additional cues in a suitable scaffold material. The scaffold may be nanofibrous patch, hydrogel or custom designed films. Integration of stem cells and biomolecular cues along with the scaffold may provide the right microenvironment for the repair of unhealthy left ventricular tissue as well as promote its regeneration. © Informa UK, Ltd.},

In the existing protocol the Tallier has to wait until the decryption key is received from the voter. So it will consume lot of time. Instead of getting the decryption key value from the voter, the Tallier maintains the key information securely in the database. So, comparatively the proposed protocol consumes less time.

abstract={Even a highly secured algorithm that proves to be mathematically secured has a possibility to leak secret information, like key, thus stored while implementing them in hardware platform. This study focuses on the necessity to prevent such leakage by making some changes in the algorithm in such a way that the functionality of the algorithm is unaltered thereby assuring the possibility of attacks are greatly reduced. This study discusses the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with countermeasures against Differential Power Analysis (DPA) attacks. The study proposes two different countermeasure methods: register swapping and random recharging. As a result, it shows that these countermeasures increase the complexity of attack. © 2012 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

abstract={With the all pervasive presence of computers to all aspects of life, software reliability assessment is assuming a position of utmost importance. Moreover many commercial and governmental software systems require high mission reliability requiring both hardware and the software to be very reliable. Software reliability is acknowledged to perk up with the amount of testing efforts invested, which in turn reduces the cost of software development and in turn system cost. The scale of redundancy employed affects reliability favorably, while increasing the cost of software design and development. This paper employs an ant colony meta-heuristic optimization method to solve the redundancy allocation problem (RAP) for software systems. Herein, an ant colony optimization algorithm for the software RAP (SRAP) is devised and tested on a computer relay software that is employed for fault handling in power system transmission lines and the results presented validates the efficacy of the approach. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Biodiesel can be produced from vegetable oils and also from waste fats. Biodiesel is a mono-alkyl-ester of long chain fatty acids derived from renewable feedstock such as vegetable oils by transesterification process. The esterified cotton seed oil, pungam oil, rice bran oil, and tamanu oil are chosen as the alternative fuels. Among these oils, tamanu oil is considered for the first time as an alternative fuel. An experiment is conducted to obtain the operating characteristics of the variable compression ratio (VCR) engine run by chosen esterified oils, and the results are compared with esterified tamanu oil. From the comparison of results, it is inferred that the engine performance is improved with significant reduction in emissions for the chosen oils without any engine modification. The effective compression ratio can be fixed based on the experimental results obtained in the engine since the findings of the present research work infer that the biodiesel obtained from tamanu oil is a promising alternative fuel for direct-injection four-stroke VCR engine. © 2012 raj and kandasamy; licensee Springer.},

abstract={Digital image processing is used to identify regions in an image by using various segmentation methods. This paper gives a brief account on five of the different segmentation techniques namely region growing, watershed, thresholding, split and merge, k-means clustering methods highlighting the advantages as well as disadvantages of each of these methods. A modification of traditional region growing segmentation method is presented which automatically selects the seed points and grows the regions until all the regions in the image are segmented. The results of segmentation methods presented in the paper are not dependent on the kind of image to be segmented and these methods are used in segmenting industrial radiographic weld images in which several defects like porosity, lack of fusion, slag line, incomplete penetrations, and wormholes occur. The methods are evaluated on various types of images and efficiency of these methods in the detection of several weld defects is presented along with the experimental results. The evaluation of performance of these different segmentation methods on sample images is done on the basis of subjective criteria and conclusions are achieved. These methods are used to detect the flaws in an object by identifying the flawed region in the image. Due to this ability of region detection, it finds various applications in medical imaging, optical character recognition, computer vision, remote sensing, mobile robots and industrial radiography.},

abstract={In this paper, we proposed a novel approach based on topic ontology for tag recommendation. The proposed approach intelligently generates tag suggestions to blogs. In this approach, we construct topic ontology through enriching the set of categories in existing small ontology called as Open Directory Project. To construct topic ontology, a set of topics and their associated semantic relationships is identified automatically from the corpus-based external knowledge resources such as Wikipedia and WordNet. The construction relies on two folds such as concept acquisition and semantic relation extraction. In the first fold, a topic-mapping algorithm is developed to acquire the concepts from the semantic of Wikipedia. A semantic similarity-clustering algorithm is used to compute the semantic similarity measure to group the set of similar concepts. The second is the semantic relation extraction algorithm, which derives associated semantic relations between the set of extracted topics from the lexical patterns between synsets in WordNet. A suitable software prototype is created to implement the topic ontology construction process. A Jena API framework is used to organize the set of extracted semantic concepts and their corresponding relationship in the form of knowledgeable representation of Web ontology language. Thus, Protégé tool provides the platform to visualize the automatically constructed topic ontology successfully. Using the constructed topic ontology, we can generate and suggest the most suitable tags for the new resource to users. The applicability of topic ontology with a spreading activation algorithm supports efficient recommendation in practice that can recommend the most popular tags for a specific resource. The spreading activation algorithm can assign the interest scores to the existing extracted blog content and tags. The weight of the tags is computed based on the activation score determined from the similarity between the topics in constructed topic ontology and content of the existing blogs. High-quality tags that has the highest activation score is recommended to the users. Finally, we conducted experimental evaluation of our tag recommendation approach using a large set of real-world data sets. Our experimental results explore and compare the capabilities of our proposed topic ontology with the spreading activation tag recommendation approach with respect to the existing AutoTag mechanism. And also discuss about the improvement in precision and recall of recommended tags on the data sets of Delicious and BibSonomy. The experiment shows that tag recommendation using topic ontology results in the folksonomy enrichment. Thus, we report the results of an experiment mean to improve the performance of the tag recommendation approach and its quality. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Spatial Hyper Redundant (SHR) robot has more controllable DOF than actual DOF due to hyper redundancy. The robot has increased dexterity and is well known for its use in unstructured environments. Due to higher controllable DOF, control system becomes extremely complex to implement. Hence, to develop the same, Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol which enables lesser number of bus signals and quite suitable in an environment where large number of microprocessor based systems are employed is used. In this case, stepper motors are used to actuate the links. This research involves in design of control system for an 8 link snake like robot using CAN protocol. A node consists of a microcontroller, CAN controller, CAN transceiver and a physical medium for transmission. A PIC 18F458 is chosen as the microcontroller which has inbuilt CAN module and it is programmed using CCS compiler for the application. The CAN communication was established by sending data from one node to other for physically actuating motions of links at its initial phase and then it was extended for multiple nodes with one node as master interfaced to GUI using RS232 on one side and to other nodes through CAN. Implementation of message filtering was done for each node. Performance of the system was also studied for multiple nodes of the system. © 2012 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

abstract={Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) has become ubiquitous and is being used to access multimedia services. After the success of 802.11 wireless network standards in the industries, quality of service (QoS) issue in wireless channels became one of the main areas of the research. Compared to the wired networks wireless networks have more limitations in terms of QoS. There have been many proposals addressing end-to-end QoS guarantee in 802.11 WLAN. IEEE 802.11e standard addresses these QoS requirements of WLAN [7]. It provides enhancements to the medium access control (MAC) layer protocol for supporting both prioritized and parameterized traffic between a QoS station (QSTA) and QoS access point (QAP). A thorough investigation is made about the issues of QoS in 802.11 WLAN and the techniques to address these QoS requirements such as bandwidth and delay with different approaches like differentiated service and integrated service are adapted [3]. In this paper we have proposed an algorithm using IEEE 802.11e standard by collision avoidance and adaptively adjusting the Contention Window (CW) for enhancing the QoS of IEEE 802.11 WLAN channel. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Rapid urbanization, intense infra-structure development and increased tourism related activities have resulted in the change of landscape of the Kodaikkanal town and its surrounding, a popular hill town in Tamilnadu, South India. As an after effect, the numbers of landslides and rock-falls have increased steadily in the past decade. Landslide susceptibility analysis is carried out for this area using conditional probability analysis. The geo-spatial database for mapping landslide susceptibility consists of the factors - Relief, Slope, Aspect, Curvature, Weathering, Land use, Topographic Wetness Index and Proximity to road. Two sampling strategies - point and seed-cell are compared for landslide susceptibility mapping. The Landslide Susceptibility map developed using conditional probability method is verified using R index for both sampling strategies. The study shows that both the sampling strategies perform with good accuracy, seed cell technique excels slightly over point sampling. 86.11% of the landslides fall in the high and critical susceptible zones. The results show that conditional probability technique provides a simple tool for susceptibility analysis. The method can be used at regional scale and is a valuable input for planning purpose. © 2012 Indian Society of Remote Sensing.},

abstract={Generic rule-based systems for Information Extraction (IE) have been shown to work reasonably well out-of-the-box, and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy with further domain customization. However, it is generally recognized that manually building and customizing rules is a complex and labor intensive process. In this paper, we discuss an approach that facilitates the process of building customizable rules for Named-Entity Recognition (NER) tasks via rule induction, in the Annotation Query Language (AQL). Given a set of basic features and an annotated document collection, our goal is to generate an initial set of rules with reasonable accuracy, that are in-terpretable and thus can be easily refined by a human developer. We present an efficient rule induction process, modeled on a four-stage manual rule development process and present initial promising results with our system. We also propose a simple notion of extractor complexity as a first step to quantify the interpretability of an extractor, and study the effect of induction bias and customization of basic features on the accuracy and complexity of induced rules. We demonstrate through experiments that the induced rules have good accuracy and low complexity according to our complexity measure. © 2012 Association for Computational Linguistics.},

abstract={The present study was designed to investigate the ameliorative role of ethanolic extract from leaves of Butea monosperma in chronic constriction injury (CCI) of sciatic nerve induced neuropathic pain in rats. Hot plate, acetone drop, paw pressure, Von Frey hair and tail immersion tests were performed to assess the degree of thermal hyperalgesia, cold chemical allodynia, mechanical hyperalgesia & allodynia in the left hind paw and tail thermal hyperalgesia. Further on, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), reduced glutathione (GSH) and total calcium levels were estimated to assess the biochemical changes in the sciatic nerve tissue. Histopathological changes were also observed in the sciatic nerve tissue. Ethanolic extract of Butea monosperma leaves and pregabalin (serving as positive control) were administered for 14 consecutive days starting from the day of surgery. CCI resulted in significant changes in behavioural and biochemical parameters. Pretreatment of Butea monosperma attenuated CCI induced development of behavioural, biochemical and histopathological alterations in a dose dependent manner, which is comparable to that of pregabalin pretreated group. These findings may be attributed to its potential anti-oxidative, neuroprotective and calcium channel modulatory actions of Butea monosperma.},

abstract={In this study, we present Embedded Zerotree Wavelet (EZW) algorithm to compress the image using different wavelet filters such as Biorthogonal, Coiflets, Daubechies, Symlets and Reverse Biorthogonal and to remove noise by setting appropriate threshold value while decoding. Compression methods are important in telemedicine applications by reducing number of bits per pixel to adequately represent the image. Data storage requirements are reduced and transmission efficiency is improved because of compressing the image. The EZW algorithm is an effective and computationally efficient technique in image coding. Obtaining the best image quality for a given bit rate and accomplishing this task in an embedded fashion are the two problems addressed by the EZW algorithm. A technique to decompose the image using wavelets has gained a great deal of popularity in recent years. Apart from very good compression performance, EZW algorithm has the property that the bitstream can be truncated at any point and still be decoded with a good quality image. All the standard wavelet filters are used and the results are compared with different thresholds in the encoding section. Bit rate versus PSNR simulation results are obtained for the image 256x256 barbara with different wavelet filters. It shows that the computational overhead involved with Daubechies wavelet filters but are produced better results. Like even missing details i.e., higher frequency components are picked by them which are missed by other family of wavelet filters. © Maxwell Scientific Organization, 2012.},

abstract={In this study, the mammogram is classified as either normal or cancer pattern. In the last few decades soft computing improves the accuracy of the breast cancer detection in digital mammograms. The standard approach for diagnosis of breast cancer is biopsy. But biopsy makes patient discomfort, bleeding and infection. The CAD (Computer Aided Diagnosis) is developed for the reason of avoid unnecessary biopsy. The statistical features are extracted from the digital mammograms. These features are fed to neural network classifier to classify it into two classes namely normal and cancer. This study describes neural network classification technique. Experiments have been conducted on images of DDSM (Digital Database for Screening Mammography) database. The performance measures are evaluated by confusion matrix. By increasing the training samples this study reveals the improved classification accuracy. This CAD system achieved 94% accuracy, 96% sensitivity and 92% specificity for diagnosis of breast cancer. © Maxwell Scientific Organization, 2012.},

As the data increases, it becomes a troublesome problem especially in large database or real- time and telepresence applications, where the memory, bandwidth and storages are limited. So, in this study we propose, a novel compression method, which is achieved by video content analysis using Repeated Object Clips [ROC]. To achieve ROC, the key frame selection algorithm is used. In key frame selection process, we extract key frame from total number of frames. For selection process, initially frame separation process is carried out, then object detection and object segmentation is performed by level set method. By this novel technique moving object was tracked effectively and compression ratio increased significantly. © Maxwell Scientific Organization, 2012.},

abstract={This study proposes a semi automated method for glaucoma detection using CDR and ISNT ratio of a fundus image. CDR (Cup to Disc Ratio) is ratio of area of Optic Cup to area of Optic Disc. For a patient with glaucoma Optic Cup size increases while the Optic Disc size remains same and hence CDR will be high for glaucoma patient than normal fundus image. The ROI of green plane is taken and K-Means clustering technique is recursively applied and Optic Disc and Optic Cup is segmented. Through elliptic fiiting, area of Optic Disc and Cup is determined and hence CDR is calculated. ISNT is another parameter used for the diagnosis of glaucoma which is determined through the ratio of area of blood vessels in Inferior Superior to Nasal Temporal side. Blood vessels will shift to Nasal side for glaucoma patients, hence value will be less for glaucoma patient than normal fundus image. Matched filter and Local entropy thresholding is applied to extract blood vessels. The code is programmed in C++ using OpenCV library functions. OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a library of programming functions developed by Intel. Core, highgui, imgproc, ml are the main libraries used from OpenCV. The optimized functions in OpenCV increase the speed of operation and is very much suitable for real time mass screening purpose. A batch of 50 retinal images (25 normal set and 25 abnormal set) obtained from the Aravind Eye Hospital, is used to assess the performance of the proposed system. © Maxwell Scientific Organization, 2012.},

abstract={Among the different ocean physical parameters applied in the hydrographic studies, sufficient work has not been noticed in the existing research. So it is planned to evaluate the wave height from the satellite sensors (OceanSAT 1, 2 data) without the influence of tide. The model was developed with the comparison of the actual data of maximum height of water level which we have collected for 24 h in beach. The same correlated with the derived data from the earlier satellite imagery. To get the result of the significant wave height, beach profile was alone taking into account the height of the ocean swell, the wave height was deduced from the tide chart. For defining the relationship between the wave height and the tides a large amount of good quality of data for a significant period is required. Radar scatterometers are also able to provide sea surface wind speed and the direction of accuracy. Aim of this study is to give the relationship between the height, tides and speed of the wind, such relationship can be useful in preparing a wave table, which will be of immense value for mariners. Therefore, the relationship between significant wave height and the radar backscattering cross section has been evaluated with back propagation neural network algorithm. © Maxwell Scientific Organization, 2012.},

If the external surface defects are the main concern, then images captured with Charge Coupled Device (CCD) cameras taken in the visible regions like images taken with monochrome cameras and images taken with color cameras are made use of. If the main concern is on the internal defects, then images taken in Near Infra Red range and X-ray imaging is preferred.

In this study the objective is to perform NDT using soft computing techniques. Digital images are taken; Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) extracts features from these images. Extracted features are then fed into the classifiers which classifies them into images with and without cracks. Three major classifiers: Neural networks, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Linear classifiers are taken for the classification purpose. Performances of these classifiers are assessed and the best classifier for the given data is chosen. © Maxwell Scientific Organization, 2012.},

abstract={To store an image, large quantities of digital data are required. Due to limited bandwidth, image must be compressed before transmission. However, image compression reduces the image fidelity, when an image is compressed at low bitrates. Hence, the compressed images suffer from block artifacts. To meet this, several compression schemes have been developed in image processing. This study presents an overview of compression techniques for image applications. It covers the lossy and lossless compression algorithm used for still image and other applications. The focus of this article is basedon the overview of VLSI DCT architecture for image compression. Further, this new approach may provide better results. © Maxwell Scientific Organization, 2012.},

The objective of this study is to identify the consequences when biometric verification fails during ATM transaction and hence suggest a novel enhancement mechanism for it. The security of ATM transactions can be further strengthened using the PII (Personal Identification Image) method. The proposed security algorithm is called OTPIP (One Time Password using Image Processing) and involves two phases. The first one is a verification phase which is done using biometric systems. In case of failure of biometrics, code verification is done. This is followed by the PII phase. These two phases ensure two-tier security of ATM machine and thereby introduce a foolproof safety mechanism. © Maxwell Scientific Organization, 2012.},

LDA clustering models are used to classify object into different category. This study makes useof LDA for clustering the features obtained for the citrus fruit images taken in five different domains. Sub-windows of size 40x40 are cropped from the citrus fruit images having defects such as pitting, splitting and stem end rot. Featuresare extracted in four domains such as statistical features, fourier transform based features, discrete wavelet transformbased features and stationary wavelet transform based features.

abstract={In a growing world, the development of modern software system requires large-scale manpower, high development cost, larger completion time and high risk of maintaining the software quality. Component- Based Software Development (CBSD) approach is based on the concept of developing modern software systems by selecting the appropriate reusable components or COTS (Commercial Off-The-Shelf) components and then assembling them with well-defined software architecture. The proper selection of COTS components will really reduce the manpower, development cost, product completion time, risk, maintenance cost and also it addresses the high quality software product. In this paper, we develop an automated process of component selection by using Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) based technique by using 14 reusable components' parameters as a first time in this field. Again, for increasing the accuracy of a model, Fuzzy- Weighted-Relational-Coefficient (FWRC) matrix is derived between the components and CBS development with the help of 14 component parameters, namely, Reliability, Stability, Portability, Consistency, Completeness, Interface & Structural Complexity, Understandability of Software Documents, Security, Usability, Accuracy, Compatibility, Performance, Serviceability and Customizable. In the recent literature studies reveals that almost all the researchers have been designed a general fuzzy-design rule for a component selection problem of all kinds of software architecture; but it leads to a poor selection of components and this paper suggests adoption of a specific fuzzy-design rule for every software architecture application for the selection of reusable components. Finally, it is concluded that the selection of reusable components through ANFIS performs better than the other models discussed so far. © Maxwell Scientific Organization, 2012.},

abstract={Cyclophosphamide (CP) is one among the important anti-cancer drug that could cause hepatotoxicity due to its toxic metabolites. In the present study, in vivo antioxidant efficacy of Momordica charantia against CP induced liver injury in Wistar rats was evaluated. Hepatic damage in rats was induced by injecting CP i.p. (total of 200 mg kg-1 b.wt.) for 2 days. Protective effect of aqueous extract of Momordica charantia (MCE) was evaluated by assessing enzymic antioxidants (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione-S-transferase and glutathione reductase) and lipid peroxidation in liver and non-enzymic antioxidants (glutathione, vitamin C and vitamin E) in serum. Administration of MCE (300 mg kg-1 b.wt.) orally for 12 days restored the activities of enzymic antioxidants in liver. Non-enzymic antioxidants were restored to normal level with a concomitant normalized level of lipid peroxidation that could be achieved due to the secondary metabolites, vitamins and minerals content of Momordica charantia. Results of the present study evidenced that supplementation of MCE protected hepatic tissues from oxidative damage induced by CP, due to its protective and antioxidant effects. © 2012 Academic Journals Inc.},

abstract={Self-assembly of pristine multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in aqueous dispersion using a protein, bovine serum albumin (BSA), has been demonstrated. Step-wise conformational changes in BSA as a function of temperature have been deployed to direct the assembly of nanotubes. More specifically, CNTs distributed randomly in native BSA at 35°C as well as completely denatured BSA solution at 80°C self-assemble in the intermediate temperature range of 4565°C, as evident from scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and fluorescence studies indicate significant changes in the α-helical content of the protein with respect to the amide I and II bands and tryptophan emission intensity, respectively. The stability of CNT dispersion in BSA solution has been attributed to the hydrophobic interaction between nanotubes and the protein molecule by adding sodium cholate to the dispersion. Moreover, a mechanism based on electrostatic repulsion between BSA-bound CNTs has been proposed for the thermally reversible assembly of CNTs in BSA solution based on evidence from zeta potential measurements and FTIR spectroscopy. Thus the present report demonstrates bio-mimetic self-assembly of as-synthesized CNTs using changes in surface charge and conformation of an unfolding protein for biomedical applications and nanobiotechnology. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={For long the contributions of Indian women in economic development has not been recognized as the activities of women had been restricted from their household. However, in the present day due to evolution of the society many women are involved in recognized economic activities on equal foot with their male counterpart. For this recognition, apart from the society, women had also acquired education and skill that enabled them to be involved in the economic growth. Many literatures discussing on working urban women in the formal sector, have cited the empowerment these Indian women had gained due to their economic independence. However, in India, more than 93% of the work force belongs to the informal economy and majority of the Indian population resides in the rural areas. But there has been very limited study available about Indian rural women involved in informal sectors. Hence this study attempts to understand the participation of women in an informal activity like Street Vending in the rural town of Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu. © 2012 SASTRA UNIVERSITY.},

A heterogeneous sample of 300 customers, including college students, other adults and children from 23 Fast food service outlets including Fast food restaurants, Hotels, and road-side dhabhaas were surveyed for the study. Significantly positive inter-correlations of the SERVPERF dimensions confirm the validity of the five dimensions model in the Indian Food Industry. Customer satisfaction, though a transient judgment is more significant than service quality itself in the Food Industry.

abstract={Rapid loss of diversity of food crops has commenced from middle of 20 th century. The sustainable production of staple crops in the face of climate change is on the rattle. There is a need for a robust diversified genetic pool of landraces and traditional varieties which have inherent sturdiness against the climatic and edaphic uncertainties. Although the cultivation of traditional varieties especially in South Indian rice has been in vogue till 19th and mid 20th centuries, but its adoption declined drastically driving them to extinction. Hence, to restore and conserve the still extant traditional rice varieties especially in Tamil Nadu, suitable habitats need to be identified. Owing to the qualitative nature of the data of the habitats such as soil type, crop region and type of rocks etc., application of fuzzy model for calculating appropriate habitat suitability index was undertaken. The simulation is done in MATLAB and the results earmarked areas with classes of suitability such as Lowest, Low, Medium, High and Highest possible habitats for conservation and propagation for each of the five traditional varieties of rice chosen in the present study. © 2012 SASTRA UNIVERSITY.},

abstract={Business these days involves many people with different roles. All these roles are defined clearly in theory, but in practice one may experience a situation where his/her role in business is the deciding factor for the sustainability of the business. In short, any individual involving in any business may need to take up dynamic responsibilities to solve dynamic issues evolving in the process of doing business. In this context of modern dynamic business involving strategic decisions and managerial responsibilities, it is proposed to identify the extent to which the Indian Hindu Mythology has an impact over the current business trends. The affinity between Indian Hindu Mythology and Current Business has been described in this paper. Business in a society can be done through Foreign trade, Banking, Domestic trading and also in other forms. Even in Hindu Mythology there is a god called Lord Kubera (the God of Wealth) who is a banker and gives loans to the gods like Lord Balaji and used to balance the economic wealth in the Society(in Heaven). This paper identifies the characteristics of that can be inherited from Hindu Mythological Context, which helps in performing a meaningful business. This survey relating the Hindu Mythology and the Business helps the current Business Corporate Leaders in understanding their responsibilities and solving certain Business issues, thereby enabling them to do an efficient, ethical and meaningful business. © 2012 SASTRA UNIVERSITY.},

abstract={Efficient human resource management is highly critical task for all organizations in 21st century. Rapid advances in technology and innovation have presented a world of opportunities for the talented and educated workforce. Adding to the effects globalization and free market policies bring unique challenges for talent management and retention. In the past century engineering industries have played a pivotal role in human development and have influenced quality of living standards. But 21st century is witnessing knowledge based development. Retaining talented employees is challenging for organizations, also vital for attaining sustainable growth. Retaining talented employees is based on several factors such as human resources, environmental, relationship and organizational. In human resources management, the aspect of employee retention starts at recruitment phase itself and employee job satisfaction is highly related to factors such as employee's recognition, effective communication, empowerment, motivation, working relationship, work involvement, employee engagement, compensation, work life balance, work environment, commitment and organizational culture and climate. In this paper we examine job satisfaction and its effects on employee retention. The research has been validated by responses from a randomized sample of 165 respondents to a feedback survey. Further it is confirmed that there are several factors which exhibit a significant correlation between employee's perceived job satisfaction and their retention. © 2012 SASTRA UNIVERSITY.},

abstract={Partial discharge (PD) is a major cause of failure of power apparatus and hence its measurement and analysis have emerged as a vital field in assessing the condition of the insulation system. Several efforts have been undertaken by researchers to classify PD pulses utilizing artificial intelligence techniques. Recently, the focus has shifted to the identification of multiple sources of PD since it is often encountered in real-time measurements. Studies have indicated that classification of multi-source PD becomes difficult with the degree of overlap and that several techniques such as mixed Weibull functions, neural networks, and wavelet transformation have been attempted with limited success. Since digital PD acquisition systems record data for a substantial period, the database becomes large, posing considerable difficulties during classification. This research work aims firstly at analyzing aspects concerning classification capability during the discrimination of multisource PD patterns. Secondly, it attempts at extending the previous work of the authors in utilizing the novel approach of probabilistic neural network versions for classifying moderate sets of PD sources to that of large sets. The third focus is on comparing the ability of partition-based algorithms, namely, the labelled (learning vector quantization) and unlabelled (K-means) versions, with that of a novel hypergraph-based clustering method in providing parsimonious sets of centers during classification. © 2012 S.

The idlers' spacing is varied utilizing detuning of the pump wavelength within the SHG bandwidth. The temperature-assisted tuning of QPM pump wavelengths allows shifting the idlers together to different set of WDM channels.

abstract={Aim of this study is to focus on reducing test pattern with effective Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) reseeding. Test data volume of modern devices for testing increases rapidly corresponding to the size and complexity of the Systems-on-Chip (SoC). LFSR is a good pseudorandom pattern generator, which generates all possible test vectors with the help of the tap sequence. It can achieve high fault coverage by reducing correlation between the test vectors. Reseeding is a powerful method for reducing the test data volume and storage. This study presents a new LFSR reseeding technique for efficient reduction of test pattern. A new encoding technique is proposed in this study which is used to reduce the size of the test data. Size of the test data can be reduced by LFSR clock which is inactive for several clock cycles after the input seed is given. When the clock goes to inactive state, a rotate right shift operation is done on the seed to get all the remaining possible values. After getting all the possible values for that seed a new seed is given by making the clock active. Test data volume is reduced by storing the data only when the clock is active. With in the reduced clocks, rest of all the remaining test vectors was derived. A special Control logic is used to make the clock active as well as inactive. Experimental results are targeted to ISCAS89 benchmark circuits. © Maxwell Scientific Organization, 2012.},

Huge test patterns, larger power consumption and more accessing time are the various challenges encountered by present System on Chip (SOC) design. Various compression techniques have been developed to minimize the huge test patterns by reducing the size of the data which saves space and transmission time. Test quality of the test pattern can be improved by test data compression. By finding the proper conflict bit ('U') the proposed algorithm generates test patterns having high reduction in test compression. Small numbers of test patterns are generated using clustering technique. With proper test pattern clustering it is possible to achieve high level of compression. Validation of the proposed method is found by experimental results on ISCAS'89 and shows that compression ratio is achieved by 79% with less conflict test pattern. © Maxwell Scientific Organization, 2012.},

abstract={This study investigates the potentials of Pleurotus eryngii and Fusarium oxysporum fungal species to produce xylanase, an industrially important enzyme. The xylanase was produced in a batch fermenter using starch as carbon source at pH 6.5 and pH 5.5, respectively for P. eryngii and F. oxysporum. Maximum enzyme production was achieved on fifth day and third day for P. eryngii and F. oxysporum, respectively. Effect of pH, substrate concentration, and temperature on enzyme activity was studied. Batch enzyme kinetics was studied using Michalis-Menton model. The values of K m and V m were found to be 1.45 U/mL, 7.21 mg/mL respectively for P. eryngii xylanase and 0.4 U/mL, 1.43 mg/mL, respectively for F. oxysporum xylanase by line-weaver plot. Optimum pH for xylanase reaction was found to be 6.5 for both Pleurotus eryngii and Fusarium oxysporum. Optimum temperatures for xylanase from Pleurotus sp., and Fusarium sp., are found to be 60°C and 50°C, respectively. Thermodynamic parameters such as activation energy for xylanase activity were determined to be 28.093 and 37.155 KJ/mol from P. eryngii and F. oxysporum. Thermodynamic parameters such as enthalpy change of activation (δH *), entropy change of activation δS * were also determined. Half life was obtained as 30.13 min for xylanase by P. eryngi and 26.65 min for F. oxysporum at 90°C. This shows that among these two enzyme produced P. eryngi xylanase had shown better thermal stability.},

abstract={Fat-splitting enzymes (lipases), due to their natural, industrial, and medical relevance, attract enough attention as fats do in our lives. Starting from the paper that we write, cheese and oil that we consume, detergent that we use to remove oil stains, biodiesel that we use as transportation fuel, to the enantiopure drugs that we use in therapeutics, all these applications are facilitated directly or indirectly by lipases. Due to their uniqueness, versatility, and dexterity, decades of research work have been carried out on microbial lipases. The hunt for novel lipases and strategies to improve them continues unabated as evidenced by new families of microbial lipases that are still being discovered mostly by metagenomic approaches. A separate database for true lipases termed LIPABASE has been created recently which provides taxonomic, structural, biochemical information about true lipases from various species. The present review attempts to summarize new approaches that are employed in various aspects of microbial lipase research, viz., screening, isolation, production, purification, improvement by protein engineering, and surface display. Finally, novel applications facilitated by microbial lipases are also presented. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.},

abstract={The earliest scripts would have been written on materials such as Taalapatra and Bhurjapatra, which could not be readily preserved. In the treasure of Ayurvedic literature, many texts are missing or partially available. Only references or few verses from many such texts are mentioned in later texts. Unfortunately, a large number of Ayurvedic texts are unexplored till today are likely to exist in palm-leaf manuscripts, which are decaying or undergoing permanent annihilation. As such many unique and valuable information contained in these texts are being lost. According to a recent survey, there are more than a hundred thousand unpublished palm-leaf manuscripts on various aspects of traditional Indian knowledge in Tamil, one of India's two classical languages, the other being Sanskrit.

abstract={In the present research work, investigations were carried out to improve the performance of concrete in terms of strength and resistance to chloride-ion-penetration by incorporating metakaolin (MK) as mineral admixture in concrete. Parametric study was carried out by considering w/cm ratio, various percentage of MK and age of concrete as parameters to understand the effect of each parameter. The study was conducted for different water-to-cement metakaolin ratio (w/cm) ratios of 0. 32, 0. 35, 0. 4 and 0. 5. The MK proportion was varied from 0 to 15% with an increment of 5% and ages of concrete from 3 to 90 days were considered and experiments performed accordingly. The effects of above said parameters on the various properties of concrete such as workability, compressive strength, chloride penetrability (Rapid chloride permeability test as per ASTM C 1202), pH of concrete and depth of penetration of chloride ions were investigated, and the results of MK concrete were compared with the conventional concrete. From the results, it was observed that MK concrete showed greater strength for higher w/cm ratios (0. 4 and 0. 5) and its resistance to chloride ion penetration was more or less consistent for all w/cm ratios and the optimal amount of MK resulted significant reduction in chloride ion penetration. A Multiple non-linear regression analysis was used to develop a statistical model to predict the strength and found to have good correlation between the observed and predicted values. It was concluded that the concrete developed in this study have significant potential for use on real time projects. © 2012 Korean Society of Civil Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={The gap between known protein sequences and structures is increasing rapidly and experimental methods alone will not be able to fill in this gap. Therefore it is necessary to use computational methods to predict protein structures. Template based modeling methods could be used for sequences, which have detectable relationship with sequences of one or more experimentally determined protein structures. For predicting the structure of proteins, which does not share a detectable sequence relationship with experimental structures, ab initio protein structure prediction techniques must be used. The methods under ab initio protein structure prediction category aim to predict the structure of a protein from the sequence information alone, without any explicit use of previously known structures. These methods use thermodynamic principles and try to identify the native structure of a protein as the global minimum of a potential energy landscape. However, such methods are computationally complex and are extraordinarily challenging. There has been significant progress in the development of ab inito protein structure prediction methods over the past few years. This review describes the basic principles, the complexity, challenges and recent progresses of ab initio protein structure prediction. © 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={The diseases of the esophagus include congenital defects like atresia, tracheoesophageal fistula as well as others such as gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD), Barrett's esophagus, carcinoma and strictures. All esophageal disorders require surgical intervention and reconstruction with appropriate substitutes. Primary anastomosis is used to treat most cases but treatment of long gap atresia still remains a clinical challenge. Autologous graft therapies using tissues from colon, and small and large intestine or gastric transplantations have been attempted but have constraints like leakage, infection and stenosis at the implanted site, which leads to severe morbidity and mortality. An alternative for autologous grafts are allogenic and xenogenic grafts, which have better availability but disease transmission and immunogenicity limit their applications. Use of biodegradable and biocompatible scaffolds to engineer the esophagus promises to be an effective regenerative strategy for treatment of esophageal disorders. Nanotopography of the fibrous scaffolds mimics the natural extracellular matrix (ECM) of the tissue and incorporation of chemical cues and tailoring mechanical properties provide the right microenvironment for co-culture of different cell types. Scaffolds cultured with esophageal cells (epithelial cells, fibroblast and smooth muscle cells) might show enhancement of the biofunctionality in vivo.

abstract={Scientists and researchers are currently focusing considerable attention on the hydrodynamic characteristics of semicircular breakwaters worldwide, particularly in Japan and the People's Republic of China. A semicircular breakwater is a composite breakwater made of prestressed concrete and has several merits over a conventional rubble mound breakwater, e.g. it is technically advanced, economically viable and aesthetically pleasing. At low water levels, it serves as a rubble mound breakwater and, at high water levels, it acts as a composite breakwater in the emerged condition. It reduces the considerable magnitude of dynamic forces if constructed in front of a vertical wall (the main structure) under the submerged condition and also reduces coastal erosion along the shoreline. Many research studies are being carried out all over the world to evaluate the performance of a semicircular breakwater in the laboratory and in the field. The authors of this review paper have also conducted a large number of experiments to study the hydrodynamic characteristics of a semicircular breakwater and to optimize the parameters such as the rubble mound height, the water depth and the size of perforations. The experiments were conducted for both the emerged condition and the submerged condition subjected to regular and random waves with various wave heights and periods to find the suitability of a semicircular breakwater in the field, and the optimum parameters were recommended in their previous publications. Hence, a sincere attempt has been made in this review paper to present the ongoing research on semicircular breakwaters, which has been carried out all over the world to facilitate the studies of researchers and to provide related information to people working in the area of semicircular breakwaters. © 2012 IMechE.},

abstract={Muller cells play a prominent role in inflammatory conditions of the retina. They are part of the retinal innate immune response. The endocannabinoid system functions as an immune modulator in both the peripheral immune system as well as the central nervous system. We hypothesized that the neuroprotective ability of exogenous endocannabinoids in the retina is partially mediated through Muller glia. This study reports that exposure to endocannabinoids in activated but not resting primary human Muller glia inhibit production of several proinflammatory cytokines, while elevating anti-inflammatory mediators. Cytokine generation in activated Muller glia is regulated by endocannabinoids through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family at multiple signaling stages. Anandamide (AEA) acts to control MAPK phosphorylation through MKP-1. Both AEA and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) inhibit the transcription factor NF-κB and increases the regulatory protein, IL1-R-associated kinase 1-binding protein 1. Endocannabinoids also increase expression of Tristetraprolin in activated Muller cells, which is implicated in affecting AU-rich proinflammatory cytokine mRNA. We demonstrate that exogenous application of AEA and 2-AG aid in retinal cell survival under inflammatory conditions by creating an anti-inflammatory milieu. Endocannabinoids or synthetic cannabinoid therapy may therefore orchestrate a molecular switch to bias the innate immune system suchthat the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine generation creates a prosurvival milieu. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={On the basis of a thermal process, a facile, low cost, one-step approach for preparing iron oxide (Fe2O3) incorporated ordered magnetic mesoporous silica nanocomposites by a co-operative self-assembly approach is presented. Various mesostructured silica materials incorporated with different amounts of iron oxide (nSi/nFe = 1/1, 1/0.5, 1/0.25 and 1/0.123) at various pH (&lt;1, 3, 5 and 7) were synthesized and characterized by electron microscopy and X-ray diffractometry. Further, the surface area and magnetic properties were evaluated using N2-sorption analyses, and a superconducting quantum interference device interfaced with a vibrating sample magnetometer (SQUID-VSM) respectively. The transmission electron micrographs and nitrogen sorption analysis indicated that most of the Fe2O 3 domains of several nanometers were embedded in the silica walls, rather than dispersed in the mesopores. The incorporation of iron oxide into the mesopores without compromising the structural and textural properties was achieved at pH &lt; 1. These structures have great potential in diagnostics and therapeutics. However, the acceptance of this material by the biological host is a critical issue for such biomedical applications. In this study, we have also evaluated the in vivo biocompatibility of these magnetic mesoporous materials in a rat model. The histopathological results show that this magnetic material can be classified as a level 2 biomaterial that can be safely used for short term applications such as MRI imaging, hyperthermia, targeted drug delivery, etc. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={Cigarette smoking has been accepted as a risk factor for coronary artery disease. The present study investigate the influence of cigarette smoking on Copper (Cu), Zinc (Zn), Chromium (Cr), Nickel (Ni) and cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides (TG). Thirty three healthy men (21 Smokers and 12 non-smokers) from Thanjavur Transport Corporation, Thanjavur, volunteered to participate in this study. A questionnaire was used to assess smoking habits, blood pressure and anthropometric measurements. The random blood samples were collected. Two statistical methods were used. The Pearson correlation co-efficient indicates the strong positive relationship of Cu with smokers, Ni and Zn. Likewise Zn reciprocates its positive relation with smokers and Ni. TG is significantly correlated with smokers and Cu. As per PCA analysis, Factor 1 shows strong influence due to smoking, Zn, Cu, and TG. The factors in 2 and 3 one finds the role of Cr and Ni, and TC and TG respectively. These findings suggest that cigarette smoking may cause an imbalance among trace elements which may initiate the deterioration process associated with cardiovascular disease; thereby it becomes a risk factor to coronary artery disease.},

abstract={Document clustering generate clusters from the whole document collection automatically and is used in many fields including data mining and information retrieval. Clustering text data faces a number of new challenges. Among others, the volume of text data, dimensionality, sparsity and complex semantics are the most impodant ones. These characteristics of text data require clustering techmques to be scalable to large and hgh dimensional data and able to handle sparsity and semantics. In the traditional vector space model, the unique words occurring in the document set are used as the features. But because of the synonym problem and the polysemous problem such a bag of original words cannot represent the content of a document precisely. Most of the existing text clustering methods use clustering techniques whch depend only on term strength and document frequency where single terms are used as features for representing the documents and they are treated independently whch can be easily applied to non-ontological clustering. To overcome these issues, this study makes a survey of recent research done on ontology or thesaurus based document clustering. © Medwell Journals, 2012.},

To provide security besides cryptographic primitives, secret key also play a vital role. The reason for key management is to set up and to provide secure channels among sensor nodes in WSN applications. Various key management schemes are proposed for WSN. Deploying sophisticated network based Key Management protocol in WSN is critical and important task. From the literature survey, it is understand that more energy is consumed to establish wireless sensor network in any real time applications.

Due to data security issue with cloud computing many business organization have fear in storing their data in Cloud. So the most challenging task of the business organization is to provide high security for their data since the data are sensible related to their business.

In this study, we propose a novel technique which involves the concept of dominators to optimize the code.

In this paper, the intension is to allow the legitimate user to access the target website and perform the selective operations on the database to avoid threats and protect the database from unauthorized users. The designed Web Prior Architecture (WPA) permits the legal client to obtain the privilege license by clicking on an authority link provided by the referrer. Using this license, the client can get the liberty to perform the operations on the target website. In that website, database can be accessed by the client with the selective permissions. These can be performed by the two methods, namely strategy toning and strategy management. By this way, the database is accessed in a highly securable manner. The massive scale of this study specifies the method to avoid the threats from the unauthorized users and augment the intrusion response system. This will protect the target website and its database from the unconstitutional users.

abstract={Inductors are bulky and costly but, reducing the size of the inductors reduces the quality factor. There is also a fundamental limitation of using inductor that it cannot be suitable for the micro miniature structure and integrated circuits applications. Because of these limitations, inductors cannot be used in most of the analog circuit applications. Hence simulated inductors are used as an alternative. In case the simulated inductor becomes floating, the simulated circuit for replacement of inductor will be different. In this paper the various floating inductors used in the literature are reviewed and some ideas are proposed which make use of linear transformation for converting floating inductor into grounded inductor. Such transformation results in the formation of a new D element called the Frequency Dependent Negative Resistance (FDNR). Also, this paper presents the basic circuits for simulating the Frequency Dependent Negative Resistance and its applications in analog circuits in the place of floating inductor. © Maxwell Scientific Organization, 2012.},

The influence of temperature (31-45 °C), particle concentration (< 2 vol %) and ultrasonication on the viscosity of sand-ethylene glycol-water dispersions was studied. The thermal conductivity of dispersions as a function of particle concentration and ultrasonication has also been investigated. Correlations were developed for the prediction of relative viscosity and thermal conductivity ratio of the dispersions.

The compounds that bind to the ß-tubulin can inhibit the formation of microtubule through which cancer cell proliferation can be stopped. To find the structure of the ß- tubulin of homosapiens, homology modeling has been done. Pharmacophore modeling has been carried out with nearly 49 compounds obtained from literature study. Molecules having similar pharmacophoric features have been searched through the use of zinc database. The obtained ligand molecules were properly validated using Lipinski rule based on which some of the molecule were filtered out.

abstract={Two phase heat transfer involving two immiscible systems is gaining importance in petrochemical and allied industries. Varying compositions of oleic acid and water were experimentally studied in a 1:2 shell and tube heat exchanger. The data on pure water and oleic acid were fitted to an equation of the form h 1φ = a N Re m. The two phase multiplier,F{cyrillic} L, was related to Lockhart Martinelli(L-M) parameter, χ tt 2, using the two phase data and a correlation FF{cyrillic} L = b* χ tt 2 / c+ χ tt 2was established. The two phase heat transfer coefficient was calculated based on the coefficients 'a' and 'm' for pure oleic acid and pure water along with FF{cyrillic} L and L-M parameter. The calculated values of two phase heat transfer coefficient h 2φ based on pure oleic acid and pure water suggest that oleic acid is a better reference fluid since the average error is much lesser compared to pure water as reference.},

Water Hyacinth (WH) which is a cheap lignocellulosic material (Cellulose, Hemicellulose and Lignin) found in ponds is used as a substrate in ethanol production. WH is pretreated using Acid hydrolysis (10%) followed by Detoxification. Ethanol is obtained from Water Hyacinth by Simultaneous Saccharification and fermentation (SSF) where saccharification is done by using cellulase enzyme and fermented using Zymomonas mobilis CP4 (recombinant Strain) which can ferment both glucose (from cellulose) and xylose (from hemicellulose). The benefit of using SSF is that it is a speedy process with a minimum consumption of time and cost. Effect of inducers FeSO 4.7H 2O, MnCl 2.4H 2O, ZnSO 4.7H 2O and MgSo 4.7H 2O of ethanol production was studied using Plackett-Burman design.

Pressure drop plays an important role in the economic design of the pneumatic conveying system. A review of correlations available for estimation of drag coefficient and the particlewall friction has been made. The ability of correlations to predict the pressure drop for the data available in the literature has been studied using a one-dimensional, two-fluid model. The simulation, along with statistical analysis indicates the suitability of few correlations for drag coefficient estimation for a wide range of particle size and solid mass flow rates. For the estimation of particle-wall friction, a correlation suitable for large particles at large solid feed rate needs to be developed from experimental results.},

abstract={Electrospun nanofibrous scaffolds have received a great deal of attention in tissue engineering in recent years. Bridging larger nerve gaps between proximal and distal ends requires exogenous tubular constructs with uniaxially aligned topographical cues to promote the axonal re-growth due to the lack of fibrin cable formation. In this study, we have designed and developed a collector to obtain aligned nanofibers of PLGA-PCL. The average diameter of the fibers obtained is 230 ± 63 nm and the alignment of fibers is quantified by calculating relative angle of each fiber. The tensile strength, porosity, contact angle, and biodegradation of the uniaxial PLGA-PCL nanofibers are measured and compared with the corresponding random fibers. Pore size, Young's modulus, and degradation of the aligned scaffold are significantly lesser than random fibers (p0.05). The in vitro cell adhesion and proliferation of Schwann cells on the aligned nanofibers are evaluated and compared with random nanofibers. Our results demonstrate that the alignment of nanofibers has a significant influence on the adhesion and proliferation of Schwann cells. Thus, the axially aligned nanofibers may mimic the fibrin cable architecture; thereby it may represent an ideal scaffold for extending the growth of axonal processes. © 2012 Biomedical Engineering Society.},

Associative Neural Network (ASNN) and Polynomial Neural Network (PNN) methods are used to construct the Non-linear prediction models. The selected descriptors are used as input data for training and testing the Associative Neural Network and Polynomial Neural Network. Predicted results are in good agreement with the experimental refractive index of organic compounds. The results are cross-validated by Leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation procedure. Comparison of ASNN and PNN reveals that ASNN predicts refractive indices with better accuracy with R2=0.962.

Inadequate weld bead dimensions such as shallow depth of penetration may contribute to failure of a welded structure since penetration determines the stress carrying capacity of a welded joint. In this study, the regression model was used to establish a relationship between welding input parameters and depth of penetration for gas tungsten arc welding of 202 grade stainless steel plates. A five level four factor central composite rotatable design (CCRD) with 31 experimental runs was used to conduct the experiments. The process control parameters chosen for the study are welding current (I), welding speed (V), welding gun angle (Θ) and shielding gas flow rate (Q). A mathematical model was developed to correlate the process parameters to depth of penetration. The developed model was then compared with the experimental results; it was found that the deviation falls within the limit of a 95% confidence level. Additionally, the results obtained from the mathematical model were more accurate in predicting depth of penetration. The direct and interactive effects of the process parameters are also discussed.},

abstract={Water plays an important role in protein-DNA interactions. Here, we examine using molecular dynamics simulations the differences in the dynamic and thermodynamic properties of water in the interfacial and intercalating regions of EcoRI bound to the cognate and to a minimally mutated noncognate DNA chain. The results show that the noncognate complex is not only more hydrated than the cognate complex, but the interfacial waters in the noncognate complex exhibit a faster dynamics, which in turn reduces the hydrogen-bond lifetimes. Thus, the higher hydration, faster reorientation dynamics and faster hydrogen-bond- relaxation times of water, taken together, indicate that, even with a minimal mutation of the DNA sequence, the interfacial regions of the noncognate complex are more poised to allowing the protein to diffuse away than to promoting the formation of a stable complex. Alternatively, the results imply that the slowed water dynamics in the interfacial regions when the protein chances upon a cognate sequence allow the formation of a stable specific protein-DNA complex leading to catalytic action. © This journal is the Owner Societies 2012.},

abstract={Metal Organic Framework-5 (MOF-5) can be used for sensing of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs). VOCs are emitted from biological sources, paints, coatings, etc. and they pollute the environment thus posing serious health and environmental hazards. MOF-5 is a three dimensional crystalline coordination compound made up of Zn 4O inorganic group as the vertex and benzene decarboxylate organic group as the spacer in the unit cell of the crystal. This study reported the synthesis and characterization of MOF-5 and its capability towards sensing of VOCs like ethanol, formaldehyde and acetone. Transmission Electron Micrograph reveals that the synthesized sample is highly crystalline and porous. BET surface area obtained was found to be 230 m 2 g -1. MOF-5 was made into pellets of thickness around 3 mm for sensing purposes. The material was found to be sensitive towards ethanol even at concentrations as low as 5 ppm, towards formaldehyde at higher concentrations and towards acetone at concentrations as low as 10 ppm. The order of increase in sensitivity is ethanol&gt;formaldehyde&gt;acetone. © 2012 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

abstract={Thin film of spinel ferrite has wide range of application such as magnetic sensor, readng head for magnetic recording meda, switch mode power supplies, deflection yoke rings and spintronics devices.

In the present study spinel ZnFe 2O 4 with good adhesion on glass substrate have been prepared uslng home built spray pyrolysis unit from mixed zinc and iron nitrates of 1:2 M aqueous solutions. Photograph of the prepared film shows that as film thickness increases, the color of the film changes from golden yellow to red-brown and is due to increase in grain size. X-ray line broadening techmque was adopted to obtain grain size and microstrain. It was obsenred that the surface morphology and optical transmittance strongly depends on film thickness. Band gap of the film varies kom 2.08 to 2.70 eV as film thickness decreases.

abstract={Micro Electromechanical Systems (MEMS) actuators experience pull-in imtability in their actuation range. MEMS actuating elements are thin parallel plate capacitor electrodes separated with air gap. The electrodes are fabricated from silicon as substrate layer and gold /aluminum layer as functional layer for reflecting laser beam in optical switching application. When the top electrode is attracted towards bottom electrode, as it crosses one third distance of the gap between the electrodes, it undergoes pull-idsnap-down with bottom electrode. Ths condition severely limits the device operating range. These devices are operated either analog or digital mode for positioning of the top electrode. The plate electrodes actuated in tilting mode or bending mode and they are typically torsional stmctures or fixed-fixed stmctures. Ths paper provides theoretical pull-in analysis for the static behavior of a optical switch model. It is derived from analytical modeling of the parallel plate type with fixed-fixed stmctural end conditions. The effect of dielectric layer thickness is taken into account for predicting the pull-in voltage. During the piston mode actuation cycle, when the threshold (pull-in) voltage is reached, the switch is in the bent or ON state due to electrostatic repulsiodattraction and for the no voltage condtion it is in the parallel or OFF state. The pull-in hysteresis behavior of the multilayered micro-actuator bending beam model is analyzed for the variation in thickness of dielechic material. In this paper, the critical role of different dielechic layer materials in bringing down the static pull-in voltage is discussed. © 2012 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

abstract={Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are frameworks of 1-3D formed by the interaction between organic molecules and metal ions/clusters. The high specific surface area (~1000-5000 m 2 g -1) and large pore volume (~0.7-2.5 cc g -1) of these molecules render them as ideal candidates for catalysis, gas absorption, separation of gases and sensing applications. The pore size and surface area can be tailored by modifying the synthetic conditions. In this paper, we report the synthesis and characterization of MOF-199 for potential application in enzyme-based sensing. MOF-199 was synthesized under room temperature using benzenetricarboxylic acid and a 1:1:1 mixture of DMF/ethanol/copper (II) acetate. Further, triethylamine (0.5 mL) was added to the reaction mixture and the resultant mixture was stirred for 23 h followed by drying to obtain a bluish crystalline material of MOF-199.

abstract={Lattice vibrational dynamics of nanostructured CdO lattice with two slightly different lattice constants (4.69 and 4.61 Å) has been investigated using Born von Karman model. CdO materials were prepared as thin film form on glass substrate by spray pyrolysis technique. An aqueous solution of 0.05 M Cadmium acetate is sprayed as fine mist on the preheated glass substrate at two different temperatures to form CdO thin film. The CdO films obtained at 220°C and 260°C have lattice constants of 4.69 and 4.61 Å, respectively. Born von Karman model was employed to obtain the dispersion relations of phonons and frequency density of states of the face centered cubic structured CdO crystals. Born Mayer potential was used to estimate the force constants of inter-atomic interactions between first five neighbors for both the CdO lattices. The dynamical matrix was constructed with the estimated force constants and hence eigen values and vectors were determined for a set of 73 wave vector points obtained from reciprocal lattice. The density of phonon states found to be accumulated in the higher frequency region. The amplitude of lattice vibration that is Debye Waller factor and lattice contribution to the specific heat capacity was estimated for various temperatures. A significant change in phonon dispersion, specific heat capacity and Debye Waller factor values have been observed between the nanostructured CdO crystals of different lattice constants. © 2012 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

abstract={Antimony Doped Tin Oxide (ATO) thin films with high optical transparency and good electrical conductivity are seem to be one of the most appropriate Transparent Conducting Oxide (TCO) layers for use in solar cells which have received significant commercialization. In the present study, ATO films were deposited on glass substrates (Ts = 350±5°C) from the starting solutions prepared by dissolving the same amount of precursor with different volumes of solvent (10, 20,....., 50 mL) using an inexpensive and simplified spray technique using perfume atomizer. The influence of solvent volume on the electrical, optical and structural properties was studied. A minimum electrical resistivity (ρ) of 4.4x10 -4 Ω cm is obtained for the ATO film deposited from the lowest solvent volume (10 mL), whereas the ATO film deposited from highest solvent volume (50 mL) exhibits maximum electrical resistivity of 40.96x10 -4 Ω cm. Thus, the ρ value increases by nearly one order when the solvent volume increases from 10-50 mL. The predominant role of the presence of oxygen vacancies may be the reason for the lower electrical resistivity of the former case. The average optical transmittance in the visible region is 80%. The obtained optical band gap (E g) values are found to be increased (3.66-3.88 eV) with the decrease in the solvent volume. From the XRD patterns it is revealed that, all the films show the preferential orientation along the (110) plane irrespective of the solvent volume. © 2012 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

abstract={The performance parameters of solar modules are characterized under Standard Test Conditions (STC). However, solar modules when deployed outdoor results in the output that differs from its output obtained at STC, due to the influence of various environmental factors, leading to confusion in deciding the appropriate electrical components and loads used for Solar Photovoltaic (SPV) power plant. In view of the above, Outdoor performance characterization of the multi-crystalline silicon solar module was studied. Daily solar illumination data were measured using an optical Pyranometer and analyzed together with the module output power. Blow of air mass was found very active at the site. Stable voltage output and dynamic current outputs were recorded. The average module efficiency of ~10 and 9.5% were obtained for the high and low illumination days, respectively. However, the integrated daily efficiency was found as 9.8% irrespective of the variation in solar illumination. Percentage of variations between the solar illumination and its associated current output under the blow of air mass were not found matching. Higher blow of air mass and its associated reduction in the solar insolation condition found yielding higher current output than the expected. © 2012 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

abstract={Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) is an important part of bioinformatics domain in which two or more biological sequences, such as proteins, DNA or RNA are aligned sequentially. This Multiple Sequence Alignment plays a vital role in the generation of phylogenetic tree as well as predicting the protein structure. The protein sequences are generally used to generate the Phylogenetic tree. To attain this, we have transformed the protein sequences into numerical values using a substitution matrix and optimized those numerical values using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method. The PSO is a meta-heuristic computational approach for performing optimization. The PSO uses the random values for pair-wise sequence alignment, resulting in decrease in the rate of the residues matched. This study presents how the rate of matching process can be improved by replacing the random values with the substitution matrix values if there is a positive value in the matrix. As result of this, we have also found that the score of the alignment sequence has been improved. © Maxwell Scientific Organization, 2012.},

abstract={Watermarking techniques have been proposed to solve the problem of copyright protection and authentication. Using the idea from [1] in this paper [LVW-PBB], the best block for embedding the watermark is identified, that is based on similarity between DCT coefficients of original image and the watermark image. The embedding method is based on [2] which use the deterministic one-to-one compound mappings of image pixel values. The compound mappings are proved to be reversible, which allows for lossless recovery of original images from watermarked images. Different types of visible watermarks, including opaque monochrome and translucent color ones, are embedded by using the proposed approach. For Security protection, parameter and mapping randomizations have also been proposed. In case of various attacks such as JPEG compression, filtering, cropping, and additive Noise, the quality of cover image is acceptable even after the watermark extraction. Thus the proposed method is robust. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Image steganography is a rapidly developing field with immense applications to offer high data security. There are two types' or rather two domains in which image steganography has been achieved, spatial and frequency domain. Spatial domain steganography focuses on embedding of the payload on the LSB bits of the pixels on the image, while frequency domain steganography focuses on the transformation of the image pixels using various transform algorithms and then embedding data in the transformed pixels. The most commonly used transform mechanism is the IWT (Integer Wavelet Transform) because of the obvious reason that it yields integer coefficients which are very easy to work with. This paper elucidates the use of Haar Integer Wavelet Transform for Constant and Adaptive number of bit embedding method. Both types are analyzed and finally the method with the highest embedding capacity with high PSNR is adjudged best. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

A dose of ferulic acid (10 mg/kg body weight) and resveratrol (20 mg/kg body weight) were administrated orally, to the alloxan-induced diabetic mice. The levels of basic biochemical markers and lipid peroxidation were significantly (P<0.05) increased in alloxan-induced diabetic mice. The levels of antioxidants were significantly (P<0.05) decreased in liver, kidney and serum. Immunohistochemical studies in alloxan induced mice demonstrated a marked increase in the immunoreactivity of nuclear transcription factor (NF-κB). Treating the diabetic mice with doses of ferulic acid and resveratrol restored the changes in the above parameters analyzed.

In this paper, an edge based local search algorithm, called ELS, is proposed for the MWC, a well-known combinatorial optimization problem. ELS is a two phased local search method effectively finds the near optimal solutions for the MWC. A parameter 'support' of vertices defined in the ELS greatly reduces the more number of random selections among vertices and also the number of iterations and running times. Computational results on DIMACS benchmark graphs indicate that ELS is capable of achieving state-of-the-art-performance for the maximum weighted clique with reasonable average running times.},

The main aim of this study was to produce physical dispersions of Nimesulide with polymers Eudragit EPO and Mannitol and then subject it for milling, to analyze the role played by different type and concentrations of polymers and the mechanism of impact and attrition milling in enhancing the solubility of the pure drug and its physical dispersions. Using ball milling technique the physical dispersions of Nimesulide with the polymers, prepared in the ratios of 1:1, 1:3, 1:5 were subjected to size reduction for two different time intervals of 30 min and 90 min, individually. Particle size, flow property and solubility of the milled dispersions were assessed and compared with the non milled dispersions and the pure drug. The milled dispersions were fabricated into tablets and the evaluation parameters like weight variation, disintegration time, hardness and dissolution studies were conducted on the prepared tablets. In order to observe the changes in the solid state at powder level and molecular level, the formulations were characterized by Fourier Transform Infra Red Spectroscopy (FTIR), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and X-Ray Diffractometer (XRD). The results obtained show that the physical dispersions prepared by milling with Mannitol helped in increasing the dissolution rate of the drug.},

abstract={This research article presents a hypergraph-based algorithm that segments a noise-free gray (monochrome) image and then detects the edges in the image. The input image is represented as a hypergraph called the Intensity Interval Hypergraph associated with the image. Then the image is segmented on the basis of bondedness of pixels. The segmented image is then the input for the edge detection part. Here the pixels in each segment are grouped into two disjoint subsets: the interior pixels and the edge pixels. Then the interior pixels are suppressed, so that the edge pixels stand out to reveal the edges in the image. Earlier hypergraph-based algorithms were of complexity O(n 2) or O(n 3), while the complexity in this approach is O(n). © 2012 Pushpa Publishing House.},

abstract={Low alloy steels produced through powder metallurgy route of sintering followed by forging are promising candidate materials for high strength small components. Porosity in such steels poses a real challenge during acid pickling treatment, which is one of the processing steps during manufacturing. The present research work attempts to investigate the mechanism underlying the acid corrosion behaviour of some sintered low alloy steels under induced acid pickling conditions. Sintered-forged low alloy steel samples containing molybdenum (Mo), copper (Cu) and titanium (Ti) were subjected to aqueous corrosion attack by immersing the samples in 18% HCl (Hydrochloric acid) solution for 25. h. Sample weight loss and Fe (Iron) loss were estimated for the corroded samples. The morphology of the corroded surfaces was studied through metallography and scanning electron microscopy. Higher porosity alloys underwent enhanced corrosion rates. Both corrosion rate and iron loss are found to decrease linearly with reduction in porosity in all cases of the alloys. The alloying elements Mo, Ti and Cu, when added in combination, have played a complementary role in the reduction of corrosion rate by almost one order of magnitude compared to unalloyed steel. Presence of carbides of the carbide forming elements Mo and Ti played a positive role on the corrosion behaviour of the low alloy steels. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Context: Blepharis maderaspatensis L. Roth (BM) (Acanthaceae) and Ammannia baccifera L. (AB) (Lythraceae) are used in folk medicine for various stomach disorders. Objective: The chloroform and ethanol extracts of both plants were evaluated for antioxidant, gastric antisecretory, and gastroprotective properties. Methods: Antioxidant properties of the extracts were evaluated using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging assay and nitric oxide (NO) scavenging assay. The gastric antisecretory properties of the extracts were assessed, at a dose of 100 and 200 mg/kg, using aspirin-pylorus ligation induced gastric ulcer models and the gastroprotective activity of the extracts was assessed, at a dose of 100 and 200 mg/kg, using HCl-ethanol induced ulcer models in rats. Results and discussion: Ethanol extract of BM (EBM) possessed good antioxidant property with IC50 values of 37.4 and 44.1 g/mL in DPPH and NO scavenging assays respectively, where 25-250 μg/mL concentration in DPPH assay and 30-300 μg/mL concentration in NO scavenging assay were used. Ethanol extract of AB (EAB) at a dose of 200 mg/kg reduced the free acidity to 142.66 mEq/L and total acidity to 451.22 mEq/l. It reduced the gastric secretion with increase in pH from 2.2 to 3.15. Possessing good antisecretory activity, it also reduced the ulcer by 92.2% in aspirin and pylorus ligation induced gastric ulcer models. EAB increased the mucus secretion and adherent mucus in the tissues with a 71.43% reduction of ulcerin HCl-ethanol induced ulcer models, at a dose of 200 mg/kg. This activity can be attributed to the various flavonoids like rutin and kaempferol-3-O-β- glucopyranoside, and the phytosterol, β-sitosterol-3-O-β- glucopyranoside, and phenolics present in the extracts. Conclusion: EBM possessed significant antioxidant property while EAB possessed good antisecretory and gastroprotective activity. © 2012 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.},

Transformation of I(D)/I(G) ratio from a higher value on the surface to a lower value in the wear track of DLC indicates formation of graphitized/amorphized tribofilm during sliding. These tribofilms and formation of carbonaceous transfer layer is a characteristic of easy in-plane sliding which provides low friction coefficient for the system of DLC/Ni and DLC/Ti multilayer. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={The ex vivo cultured limbal stem cells over a biocompatible scaffold are used in the management of limbal stem cell deficiency as an ideal replacement for human amniotic membrane (HAM). A novel source of collagen from fish scales (FSC) was used to fabricate the scaffold. In this study, we have evaluated the physicochemical, mechanical, and culture characteristics of FSC and compared with denuded HAM. The cultured corneal cells were characterized by real-time polymerase chain reaction for putative stem cell markers. The swelling ratio, collagenase assay, and microbial resistance of FSC gave better results when compared to those of HAM. The mechanical and physical strengths of FSC were good enough to handle when compared to HAM. Under microscopic observation, epithelial migration was noted at the end of 48h from limbal explants plated on FSC and on HAM at the end of 72h. By the end of the 15th day, 90 to 100% confluent growth was seen resembling the morphological features of limbal epithelium. In conclusion, FSCs from a novel renewable biological source were optically clear with sufficient strength, and gave encouraging results in culture studies; the same may be tried as potential candidate for corneal transplantation after in vivo studies. © 2012, International Center for Artificial Organs and Transplantation and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={The present study investigated the neuroprotective effect of curcuminoids, the active polyphenols of Curcuma longa (L.) rhizomes against inflammation-mediated dopaminergic neurodegeneration in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2,3,6- tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) model of Parkinson's disease (PD). Male C57BL/6 mice were pre-treated with curcuminoids (150 mg/kg/day) for 1 week, followed by four intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections ofMPTP (20mg/kg) at 2 h intervals with further administration of curcuminoids or deprenyl (3 mg/kg/day) for 2 weeks. Our results show that oral administration of curcuminoids significantly prevented MPTP-mediated depletion of dopamine and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity. In-addition, pre-treatment with curcuminoids reversed glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) protein expression, as well as, reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine and total nitrite generation in the striatum of MPTP-intoxicated mice. Significant improvement in motor performance and gross behavioural activity, as determined by rota-rod and open field tests were also observed. Taken together, our findings suggest that curcuminoids exert a neuroprotective effect against MPTP-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration through its anti-inflammatory action and thus holds immense potential as a therapeutic candidate for the prevention and management of PD. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.},

abstract={There is a raging moral combat to secure information from nefarious attackers as infringement of data is alarmingly escalating with valuable secret information being sabotaged, manipulated or even sold. This has made it necessary for development of efficacious information hiding algorithm to prevent info-sabotage by undetectable secret sharing. Steganography has gained the limelight in the recent past and is formidable and belligerent as it involves embedding of secret data in either images, audio, video, etc., so unsuspectingly that even when intercepted cannot provide a hint to the hackers. However, to make it fool proof we cerebrate yet another algorithm in this paper which uses a combination of Hilbert and Moore Space Filling Curve (SFC) and the pixel indicator methodology, a steganographic tool to improve the randomness and cloak the scanning path such the adversary does not even spill on the clandestine information by an accident. Pixel Indicator (PI) technique uses the complexity of the color image which would be split into red, green and blue planes, respectively with one acting as an indicator, depending upon whose last two bits, data would be embedded in the other two planes. Thus instead of employing the usual raster scan, a random space filling curves (SFC) is used for embedding data into the pixels, because of which it would be impossible for eavesdropper to determine the path of embedding of data making it a highly robust system. The added advantages and enhancements provided by this technique can be observed by the readings of Mean Square Error (MSE) and Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) that have been obtained on implementing this algorithm. © 2012 Academic Journals Inc.},

abstract={Most important sentences from such huge repository of data are quiet difficult and demanding task. While multi document poses some additional overhead in sentence selection, generating summaries for multi document in a coherent order would create greater strength. The proposed approach uses several features to generate summaries and act as trainable summarizer. This approach use genetic algorithm to test the performance of summarizer. It is compared to state of MEAD Algorithm and Naive Bayesian Classifier. The performance is investigated at several compression rates from different profile of popular persons collected from news articles. Multi document summarization has very great impact in the internet world ever since the growth of online information and availability selecting. © Medwell Journals, 2012.},

abstract={Customer demand is ever changing unpredictable and also immeasurable with accuracy. It is also complex and very intricate. Marketing policies, programmes and strategies are planned, organized and executed with the main objective of customer satisfaction and service. Service refers to social efforts which include even government to fight five giant evils, e.g., want, disease, ignorance, squalor and illness in the society. In the 21st century, the business environmental conditions are likely to be more volatile. The globalization and liberalization has opened new vistas for the development of service generating organization. It should make sincere efforts to make them stronger and stronger if they have to survive and thrive. It is against this background the study follows about the service blueprinting, a useful tool for designing and specifying intangible service processes. A service blueprint is a schematic diagram that represents all the details of a service from the customer and organization's perspective. It maps out chronologically and in sequence all the various interactions and actions that occur in parallel when customer and company meet it shows all the interactions by and with the customer. A company that works toward implementing these strategies will be well on its way in delivering service quality through its people thereby diminishing Gap 2. © Medwell Journals, 2012.},

abstract={Gene silencing has emerged as a promising strategy for molecular therapy of various malignant, viral, hereditary and inflammatory disorders. However, its translation from lab to clinic is yet to gain momentum due to the numerous problems that plague its development. A multi-functional siRNA delivery system with desired properties such as enhanced immune compatibility, target specificity, high cell uptake and excellent silencing efficiency is required to understand the challenges involved in the selection and modification of small interfering RNA (siRNA), factors influencing the complexation process and the response of the biological system to the formulation. Liposomes have been used as delivery systems due to its versatility in handling different types of drugs, tunable size, charge and surface functionalities that improve its effectiveness in vivo. This review highlights the challenges involved in gene silencing and describes the progression of liposomal systems used in gene silencing. The rationale in introducing chemical modifications in siRNA, synthesizing designer cationic lipids and evolution of hybrid liposomal systems has been elaborated, emphasizing their merits and short-comings. Finally, a description of the current state of clinical trials involving liposomal formulations has been included to provide an unbiased perspective of the future of liposomal systems and gene silencing tools as therapeutic tools. © 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.},

Simple analytical expressions for the mode amplitudes are derived, which highlight the effects of dissimilar cores on the coupling characteristics. Although power transfer is confined among the group of identical cores, the coupling within each group is significantly affected by the presence of neighboring dissimilar cores and is dependent on the propagation constants of the eigenmodes of the composite multicore structure. The dissimilar cores can enhance or mitigate the coupling effects by choosing appropriate design parameters. The formulas can serve as a basis for understanding the cross-talk of MCFs for more complicated cases involving longitudinal perturbations. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Objective: To study the occurrence and causative agents (fungus) of dermatophytosis in patients attending the Dermatology Section of Bharat Heavy Electrical Limited Hospital and Annal Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital, Tiruchirappalli, Tamilnadu, India. Methods: A total of 519 samples were collected including infected skin, hair and nail samples for a period of 1 year. Before collecting the samples, 70% alcohol was applied to the infected area and ensured that it was totally dry. Skin samples were collected by scrapping, nail samples by clipping and hair samples collected by using sterile scalpel or forceps. Identification of the causative pathogen was done by performing slide culture, lacto-phenol cotton blue mount, hair perforation tests and urease tests. Results: Dermatophytosis was manifested clinically more in the age group of 11-20 and 21-30 years. Among various clinical conditions, tinea capitis was common in children below 12 years. Microbiological investigation revealed the presence of dermatophytic fungi in 78% of the samples. Trichophyton rubrum was the predominant pathogen followed by Trichophyton mentagrophytes. Conclusions: Further intensive epidemiological studies of dermatophytic fungus-induced dermatophytosis, which have public health significance, are needed. © 2012 Asian Pacific Tropical Medicine Press.},

abstract={Anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-XL and Mcl-1 have been reported to be over expressed in most cancer forms and consequently, designing dual inhibitors to the proteins is becoming an important strategy in cancer chemotherapy. Interestingly, the Bcl-XL and Mcl-1 show differential binding affinities with BH3-only peptides of Bim and NOXA, notwithstanding their similar three-dimensional folds. The structural determinants for the differential interactions of the proteins with the BH3-only peptides have been scrutinized using molecular docking and temperature-dependent dynamic studies. The comprehensive analysis of the data from the studies paved a way of designing dual inhibitors to the proteins, on the basis of the chemical structures of ABT-737, which is a highly potent inhibitor to the Bcl-XL. The unique feature of this approach on designing the dual inhibitors to the anti-apoptotic proteins have also been brought into detail through a comparative analysis with a few existing strategies reported on the same line in the literature © 2012 Pillay Engineering College.},

abstract={Cryptography fails at feigning hackers about the presence of secret data, but Steganography with its many, efficient and effective techniques, camouflages the fact that data has been hidden, thus overcoming cryptography's Achilles heel. It includes hiding the message in a funny photo, or the melodious number or in extravagant hair standing videos. Steganography works with a cover image, containing the whole secret message to be transferred but based on a few criteria. These criteria are called randomizations which are introduced between the cover image and secret message, thereby keeping them secure. This paper proposes a variant of pixel indicator methodology to randomize and vary the capacity of the cover image. Initially the cover image is split into Red(R), Green (G) and Blue Plane (B). The lowest intensity among R, G and B would be the indicator channel and the remaining are data channels. The number of bits of secret data that could be embedded on the data channel is based on the MSB's of the same. If for a case R is Indicator channel and GB are the data channels then MSB (if BG return 00, 1 bit is embedded on that data channel. Similarly, if (B, G) is 01, then 2 bits are embedded, if B, G is 10, 3 bits are embedded and finally, if (B,G) =11, then 4 bits are embedded. Simulation has been performed to test the effectiveness & complexity of the proposed methodology. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Micro-electromechanical Systems (MEMS) comb-drive actuators are used to drive many micro-optical components such as switching mirror, scanning mirror applications. These actuators are electrostatically operated to obtain a tilting or rotational actuation. They have proven their capabilities for accomplishing extended travel ranges-of-movement reliably within the stable range. These actuators are fabricated by using different state of art fabrication techniques and methods with different materials. The residual stress developed during the deposition process, influences the electromechanical behavior of the fabricated actuator. Performance-driven criteria such as analog/binary mode, unidirectional/bidirectional and expected range of actuation for the comb-drives are realized in fabrication to achieve the expected specific requirements. In this study a study has been made on the critical steps in various microfabrication sequences by adopting a fabrication scheme of the actuator which precludes the generation of residual stress. The residual stress and stiction are the important parameters they are the limiting factors; but they are used in positive way to achieve specific structural behavior of the actuators. The causes and effects of residual stress formation during the microfabrication process are studied from the literatures. This knowledge can be used to correlate the performance of MEMS actuators with the microfabrication critical parameters. © 2012 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

abstract={Biodiesel resulting from the trans-esterification of oils from plant sources can be blended with diesel and effectively used in automobiles. The efficiency of homogenous catalysts such as sulphuric acid when used for trans-esterification is low and is accompanied by difficulty in handling and separation. This work aims to use mesoporous silica which has high surface area to improve the trans-esterification efficiency of rice bran oil and since this is as a heterogeneous catalyst it may reduce handling and separation issues. Mesoporous silica was synthesized by varying solvent, pH and metal dopants to achieve various grain sizes, surface area and porosity which were characterized using XRD, SAXS, SEM, FT-IR and BET. The catalytic efficiency of each of the mesoporous silica samples was evaluated and the influence of temperature, reactant to catalyst ratio and reaction time on the biodiesel yield was investigated and compared with conventional catalysts. The optimal reaction conditions were identified as 1:15 oil to methanol ratio with 0.1 g of the catalyst at 70°C for one hour (reaction time). The high surface area of the mesoporous catalysts arising due to its porous morphology facilitated considerable improvement in the biodiesel yield up to 91%. The biodiesel product was characterized using FT-IR and GC-MS. The shelf life of biodiesel was found to be good and there was no fungal growth after long periods of storage. Moreover, the use of mesoporous silica also enabled easy recovery of the catalyst. © 2012 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

abstract={This study developed an innovative model of a vertical axis wind turbine for roof top application. The speciality of this turbine is that it need not be oriented towards the wind direction. Also, it steadies on low wind velocities and is self-starting. It is eminently suitable for water pumping applications which are the needs of the tall building today. The variations in wind velocities and consequent variation in rpm will not affect the pumping operation. It is not suitable for generation of electricity directly due to variations in output rpm and consequent variations in voltage and frequency. Therefore, it is proposed to have intermediate buffer storage in the form of compressed air. This is likely to have significant applications in rural areas. © 2012 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

abstract={Nanoparticles have attracted lot of attention for their exceptional properties which are different from those of materials in bulks. Metal oxides have shown application in many domains of science. Especially, manganese oxide has proven applications in energy storage, sensors, imaging technologies and even biomedicine. But, synthesis of ultrafine monodisperse nanoparticles that can be dispersed easily in polar or non-polar solvent is of prime importance for applications involving composites, phase change energy material, thermal management etc. We report the synthesis of ultrafine monodisperse MnO nanoparticles from manganese acetate tetrahydrate by a solvothermal method. Surfactants, oleic acid and 1-octadecene were used in suitable concentrations to yield oleic acid stabilized manganese oxide nanoparticles. The formation of manganese-oleate complex in the first step was confirmed using FTIR. X-ray diffraction spectra confirmed the formation of manganese oxide. Scanning and Transmission Electron Micrographs established the size of nanoparticles to be in the range of 15-20 nm. Crystalline nature of the nanoparticles was confirmed using selected area electron diffraction. Aging time has been found to influence the size of the nanoparticles, with layer particle sizes obtained for higher aging periods. These nanoparticles are suitable for dispersion in non-polar solvents and in thermic fluids like Therminol® 55 resulting in nanofluids. © 2012 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

This study deals with mythologies to quantify the energy losses both electrical and thermal energy and provide the help in comprehensive energy auditing to establish the conclusion to arrive the retrofit equipments and also to arrive the optimum conditions particularly the boiler operations. The equipment considered for retrofit to the rotary equipments such as pumps, fans and compressors in the chemical process industries in which energy saving can be achieved are variable speed drives. Variable speed drives operation can be understood from the affinity laws. The example an energy saving in forced draft fan and induced draft fan in a boiler which produces steam for the process are considered and discussed.

abstract={One of the bottle-necks in efficient energy recovery is attributed to the low thermal conductivity of common coolants. When the thermal conductivity of coolant is improved, the flow rate of coolant required and hence, energy required for pumping can be reduced. Nanofluids are novel class of fluids, prepared by dispersing nanoparticles in liquids like water, ethylene glycol-water mixture, oil etc. aimed at increasing the thermal conductivity of such coolants. In order to maximize the advantages of nanofluids, the particles chosen for dispersion must possess high thermal conductivity and maintain excellent colloidal stability. Cupric oxide has very high thermal conductivity (78 W mK -1) compared to that of water (0.6 W mK -1) and hence dispersion of cupric oxide in water will serve to conserve energy. We have developed cupric oxide-water nanofluids using a two-step method. Cupric oxide nanoparticles were synthesized by reduction of cupric acetate. Scanning electron micrographs revealed the presence of needle-shaped particles of 60 nm wide and 252 nm long. These particles were dispersed using ultrasonication and by the use of Cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium Bromide (CTAB) as dispersant. Stability was ascertained by visual observation of nanofluids stored undisturbed. The zeta potential was measured to be -30 mV. Electrostatic repulsion and steric repulsion are expected to be responsible for colloidal stability of CuO-water nanofluids. Particles with aspect ratio &gt;1 provide higher enhancement in thermal conductivity as evident from Hamilton and Crosser model. Hence dispersion of these nanostructures in water will improve the thermal conductivity appreciably. © 2012 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

abstract={Nanofluids are solid-liquid dispersions containing nanoparticles of size 1-100 nm in a liquid. Nanofluids that have enhanced thermal conductivity are best known for their application as coolants in food storage, transportation, refrigeration and air-conditioning industries. Considerable energy savings can be realized through the use of nanofluids as coolants. Viscosity is one of the major transport properties that determine the heat removal capability of nanofluids. The present study reports the effect of calcination temperature on the primary particle size, aggregate size of the ZnO nanoparticles and on the transport properties of the ZnO-water nanofluid. ZnO nanoparticles have been synthesized using Zinc nitrate hexahydrate as precursor. The primary particle size of the ZnO nanoparticles calcined at different temperatures ranging from 100-500°C was found to be in the range of 40-60 nm. The effect of calcination temperature on hydrodynamic size distribution of the ZnO nanoparticles has been investigated using dynamic light scattering technique. The viscosity of ZnO-water nanofluids, using ZnO powders prepared at different calcination temperatures have also been studied, along with their colloidal stability. © 2012 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

abstract={Turning is a widely used machining operation when compared to other manufacturing processes. The finished component is subjected to dimensional accuracy, required surface finish and the tool is subjected to less cutting force, minimum possible temperature and maximum tool life. In order to achieve these desired performance measures in any machining operation, proper selection of machining parameters is very essential. The present method of selection of machining parameters of machining parameters by trial and error, previous work experiences of the process planner and machining handbooks are time consuming and very tedious process. There is a need to develop a technique that could be able to find the optimal machining parameters for the desired performance measures in minimum production time and minimum production cost. In this work, Firefly Algorithm (FA) is implemented to select the optimal machining parameters such as cutting speed, feed and depth of cut in minimum possible production time and production cost on turning process. The result of FA has been compared with other optimization techniques and discussed. © 2012 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

The hybrid reactor configuration consists of direct fluidized bed in the inner core and inverse fluidized bed in annular region with anaerobic condition. The experiments were carried out in semi-continuous mode. For the direct fluidization ceramic support particles (diameter 2 mm, bulk density 1516 kg m~ 3) were used and for inverse fluidization spherical plastic beads (diameter 3 mm, bulk density 518 kg m~ 3) were used. The initial bed height was maintained at 5 cm. The reactor influent was raw distillery wastewater (pH 8.5-9, TSS 4400 mg L -1, dissolved COD 34000 mg L -1, BOD 12000 mg L -1). For the biodegradation of distillery wastewater a mixed culture obtained from cow dung and industry sludge which was kept for 15 to 20 days were used. The performance of the bioreactor for different pH and hydrodynamic behavior of novel reactor was studied. The results show that percentage reduction in COD was 95%.

abstract={The development of composite materials and the related design and manufacturing technologies are one of the most important advances in the history of futuristic materials. Composites are multifunctional materials having unprecedented mechanical and physical properties that can be customized to meet the requirements of a particular application. Electrodeposition has been identified to be a technologically feasible and for many applications, economically superior technique for the production of nanocrystalline materials. Composite coating technology has been used extensively in many manufacturing areas. Electroplating, as a methodology is used to produce a thin layer or an additional surface on to a given substrate. Thin layer is produced to modify properties of the substrate such as wear resistance, hardness, lubricity, electrical resistance, etc. Electrodeposited composite coatings which consist of a metal matrix with either a ceramic or cermet particle addition, represent a new development in the field of coating processes. In this study an attempt was made for preparation of Ni-Al 2O 3 composite coatings by adjusting the plating parameters. The results of experimental work such as mass of deposit, volume fraction of Al 2O 3 particles in the deposit and micro hardness of the deposited layer were investigated. A neural network model was trained developed and for the prediction similarities between experimental work and neural network trained results. © 2012 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

It is found that ICA performs better in detection of epileptic spikes.

abstract={This paper deals with design of various controllers such as Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller, Internal Model Controller(IMC) and transfer function controller by using Genetic Algorithm(GA) for a non-linear liquid conical tank system. Level control of a conical tank is a complex issue because of the nonlinear nature of the tank. For each stable operating point, a First Order Process with Time Delay model was identified using process reaction curve method. The need for improved performance of the process has led to the development of the optimal controllers. GA is an evolutionary algorithm that is proposed in this aspect. The performance of GA based controllers is compared with conventional controllers tuned using Ziegler-Nicholas (Z-N) closed loop method and Z-N open loop method. The comparison is done based on rise time, settling time, overshoot and Integral Time Absolute Error(ITAE) and it was found that the GA based IMC controller is better suited for this process. © 2012 Pillay Engineering College.},

abstract={This paper presents the comparison between improved asymmetric space vector modulation (ASVM) and sinusoidal pulse width modulation (SPWM) for voltage source converters (VSCs) when the switching frequency is as low as 9 times of line frequency. By adding two pulses in each line cycle when the fundamental voltage crosses zero, the total harmonic distortion (THD) of output current can be reduced significantly. The penalty of additional switching loss is very limited for high power factor operation. The applications of the improved ASVM in a single VSC is shown. With the optimization of the duration and position of the additional pulses, the ac current THD can be reduced to as low as 25% for single VSC. Such THD reduction has close relationship with space vectors' position and modulation index. Improved ASVM can also reduce the amplitude of circulating current, leading to smaller inter-phase inductors. The analysis results are verified by experiments on a demo system. © 2012 Pillay Engineering College.},

The geometry of the face changes significantly as the outcome of facial expressions yielding in good efficiency of the technique. Using stereoscopy, the depth map in an image is determined and the recognition of the face is performed. For this, we introduce a technique called AAM (Active Appearance Model) which is a powerful statistical model for modeling where the face is identified based on their feature points even though if there are many external factors to which they are very sensitive. It is very accurate in alignment and effective for handling face deformation. Then the face is projected in 3D for higher efficacy.

abstract={Wavelet theory has emerged as a new mathematical tool that can be applied in many fields such as image processing, biomedical engineering, radar, physics, control systems and communication systems. The important area of application of wavelets in communication: multiple accesses. Among the multiple access applications one of the most notable work is wavelet packet-based multiple access communication. The two new multiple access systems are Scale-Time-Code Division Multiple Access (STCDMA) and Scale-Code Division Multiple Access (SCDMA). In a STCDMA system, Direct-Sequence (DS) Code-Division Multiple Access (CDMA) is used in each time slot to identify multiple users. If time division multiplexing is excluded in each scale, SCDMA, which is a multimedia system, is obtained. These systems are analyzed over a synchronous Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) by using a conventional detector and a multiuser detector based on decorrelating detector for real and complex-valued PN sequences. These systems have better performance for complex-valued sequences compared to real-valued sequences. SCDMA can also be analyzed over an asynchronous AWGN by using a conventional detector for real-valued sequences. SCDMA is attractive compared to DS-CDMA, because it is capable of transmitting different rates of information messages. To be more specific, STCDMA is user-advantageous and SCDMA is information-advantageous. In STCDMA and SCDMA good PN sequences such as Kasami sequences are required because of the reuse capability while DS-CDMA has only limited number of them. Kasami sequences are optimal since the maximum cross correlation value achieves the Welch Lower Bound. The main purpose of using Kasami sequences is that, it decreases the multiple access interference. These PN sequences are very useful for multipath, jamming environments and synchronization purposes. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={The main objective of the paper is to increase the throughput thereby reducing the routing overhead and jitter between nodes. To achieve this, it is proposed to go for reactive routing protocols. Proactive routing protocols use table-driven strategy that is the routing tables are exchanged periodically between nodes which results in more energy consumption. To overcome these problems, we go for DSR and AODV. These routing protocols use on-demand strategy that is the routes are established from source node to destination only on demand which minimizes the jitter level. Using "Network Simulator 2.35" the performance of AODV and DSR protocols are compared for large number of nodes in the presence of ambient noise level whereas in the existing works lesser number of nodes is only considered. From our results it is evident that AODV protocol consumes lesser energy than DSR and in the presence of high routing overhead, AODV outperforms DSR by yielding higher throughput with less jitter. © 2012 Pillay Engineering College.},

The spirally coiled tube is fabricated by bending an 8.00 mm diameter straight tube into a spiral-coil of different turns. The rate of dehumidification increases along the length of the spiral coil. This is because the dehumidification in the curved tube strongly depends on the behavior of the secondary flow. The secondary flow in curved tube is caused by the centrifugal force. This force affects the flow pattern of air in the spiral coil and disturbs the humidity of the system. Moreover the dehumidification results obtained from the spirally coiled tube is proved to be higher than that of the straight tube. © 2012 Pillay Engineering College.},

abstract={This paper presents a new technique to improve the input power factor of a single-phase rectifier followed by an inductive filter. It consists in the employment of a two-quadrant active power filter, based on a conventional bidirectional DC-DC converter, connected to the output side of the diode bridge. This technique allows the extension of this rectifier range operation in the continuous conduction mode. Circuit description, operation principle, modeling, design and simulation results are presented in this paper. A laboratory prototype was designed and built, with the following specifications: input voltage: 220 VRMS; output voltage: 200 VDC; rated power: 3 kW; switching frequency: 100 kHz. By the experimental results obtained, the system presented a unity power factor and an efficiency of 95% at full load, while the maximum efficiency value was 98% at 2 kW. © 2012 Pillay Engineering College.},

Investors with risk appetite are ready to invest their savings in the stock market with the expectation of decent return. Initial public offer (IPO) provides ample opportunities to investors to divert their savings towards stock market. Since shares are offered to the public for the first time different opinions may be raised on the issue price. The main purpose of this study is to find out, the relationship if any between issue price and return and to suggest suitable exit route for the short term investors The research is purely confined to the IPOs made during the financial year 2010-2011. The research highlights the fact that even on the listing day certain companies had generated negative return and for majority of the company's return on the listing day and subsequent day is far better compared to rest of the periods. Further this research also brings out the fact that there is no significant relationship between issue price and return © 2012 Pillay Engineering College.},

abstract={It is in the nature of communication systems that multiple systems operating in the same spectrum needs to coexist in harmony. This requirement is essential and the MIMO system that we have designed using MB-OFDM also needs to work in an environment in which systems like Wi-Fi, WiMAX, etc. also works. To achieve this, we have focused on use of Active Interference cancellation techniques for MIMO systems to reduce the need for a predetermined interference calculation that is absolute and cannot be changed on short notice or be varied with respect to the prevailing environmental conditions on a real time basis. The choice of MIMO system is to achieve high data rate in short range communication. Moreover, the improvement in the notch depth is still enriched by the proposed method. The main advantage for the improving of notch depth is that it reduces the side lobes there by concentrating the power to the main lobe. This increases the efficiency of the communication network and also reduces the interference. A neural network is a tool that is able to predict an output when it recognizes a given input pattern. In this paper neural network is used to train the system for the desired output and the expected goal is reached. Back propagation algorithm is used to train the system. Cognitive radio is a technique used for efficient spectrum utilization. Spectrum sensing is the gate way for cognition cycle. We have focused on energy detection based spectrum sensing. © 2012 Pillay Engineering College.},

The camera calibration is estimated the those parameters. It is an indispensable step for medical photogrammetric or image guided applications. The quantitative information should derive from the images. Non linear optimization are widely used in camera calibration in order to the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters. The traditional optimization algorithm have such problem as being prone to get into local extreme and being susceptive to initial value in calibration. By calibrating the camera it could be used for accurate measurement. The aim of the method stereovision technique is used to capture the two images.

The images obtained from different medical imaging techniques such as Computer Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance (MR) images are fused into a new image to improve the information content for diagnosis. In the present fusion algorithm, the input images from two different modalities such as CT and MR are initially registered and then transform namely Multi-Wavelet transform and Curvelet transform are applied on the input images. Finally the resultant images are fused using various fusion techniques. Fusion results are evaluated and compared according to four measures of performance - the Entropy (H), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Correlation Coefficient (CC). © 2012 Pillay Engineering College.},

Control of liquid level in a conical tank is nonlinear due to the variation in the area of cross section of the tank system with its change in shape. The model of the process is identified using standard step response based system identification technique and it is approximated to be a first order plus dead time (FOPTD) model. The fuzzy controller is designed by gaining the error response of internal model control (IMC) based on Chien and Fruehauf's settings. From the results it is observed that fuzzy controller shows much better integral absolute error (IAE) and integral squared error (ISE) performance criteria than the conventional controller. © 2012 Pillay Engineering College.},

abstract={In this paper, a detailed study of the performance of rotor flux and reactive power based MRAS rotor resistance estimators for Vector Controlled Induction Motor drive is presented. The rotor resistance changes significantly during operation of the drive due to temperature rise and saturation. This variation has a major influence on the performance of the field oriented control of induction motor drive. The MRAS approach using reactive power as a functional candidate for rotor resistance estimation makes it computationally simpler, easy to design when compared to the other methods available for rotor resistance estimation. In this paper, two types of MRAS methods using flux and reactive power based rotor resistance estimation technique for Vector Controlled Induction Motor Drive is designed and validated through MATLAB/SIMULINK simulation. The performance of Vector Controlled Induction Motor drive with MRAS based rotor resistance estimators are analysed extensively. The comparison shows the superiority of the reactive power based Rr estimator in terms of accuracy, settling time, and stator resistance dependency.

In practical operation, the transformer experience several stress evolving conditions due to combined thermal and electrical stresses. Both thermal and electrical stresses lead to degradation of oil performance interms of poor dielectric strength and ineffective cooling action. In this proposed work, the intention is to analyze the variation of conduction current through oil and the rate at which the oil absorbs the heat injection. From the measurement of conduction current after thermal stress, it is evident that the oil degradation is appreciable as the current variation is associated with intense discharges. The measurement of temperature rise in oil, after subjecting it to electrical stress conditions, clearly shows that there is an appreciable reduction in the cooling property of oil. Therefore, the influence of thermal and electrical stress diminishes the transformer oil from serving its two folded purpose. © 2012 Pillay Engineering College.},

abstract={In this paper work, a multi-objective Economic/Environmental power dispatch optimization problem is solved using evolutionary programming by using MAT-lab programming technique. The crux of the objective is to determine the most economic loadings of the generators, such that the required load demands of the generation can be met and the operation such as equality and inequality constraints of the generators including the total emissions within the allowable emission limit for satisfactory operation of the thermal power plant. In this work only one emission of Nitrogen oxide is considered for analysis. The economic/environmental load dispatch is analyzed in two cases. Case one deals excluding transmission losses and case two deals including transmission losses in the system. The standard data of IEEE 30 bus, Six Generator systems has been taken into account and simulated with aid of MAT-lab software and results are obtained. An apposite program has been developed using evolutionary programming technique and which has been verified for various load demand. © 2012 Pillay Engineering College.},

abstract={Although anti-retroviral therapy is the most efficient disease management strategy for HIV-AIDS, its applications are limited by several factors including the low bioavailability and first pass metabolism of the drugs. Nanocarriers such as liposomes have been developed to circumvent some of these problems. We report here preparation of novel liposome formulations for efficient delivery of anti-retroviral drugs to mammalian cells in culture. The liposomes were prepared and surface was modified using poly (ethylene glycol). Encapsulation efficiency of the anti-retroviral drug saquinavir was found to be approximately 33% and also exhibited sustained release of the drug. Although PEGylated liposomes were more stable in protein-supplemented media, had better colloidal stability and exhibited lesser sonochemical stability due to lower cavitation threshold. The cell viability studies using Jurkat T-cells revealed that the PEGylated liposomes loaded with saquinavir were less cytotoxic as compared to the non-PEGylated liposomes or free drug confirming the potential of the liposomes as a sustained drug-release system. The drug delivery potential of the liposomes loaded with Alexa flour 647 was evaluated using Jurkat T-cells and flow cytometry showing uptake upto 74%. Collectively, our data demonstrate efficient targeting of mammalian cells using novel liposome formulations with insignificant levels of cytotoxicity. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={A decade since the availability of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) genome sequence, no promising drug has seen the light of the day. This not only indicates the challenges in discovering new drugs but also suggests a gap in our current understanding of Mtb biology. We attempt to bridge this gap by carrying out extensive re-annotation and constructing a systems level protein interaction map of Mtb with an objective of finding novel drug target candidates. Towards this, we synergized crowd sourcing and social networking methods through an initiative 'Connect to Decode' (C2D) to generate the first and largest manually curated interactome of Mtb termed 'interactome pathway' (IPW), encompassing a total of 1434 proteins connected through 2575 functional relationships. Interactions leading to gene regulation, signal transduction, metabolism, structural complex formation have been catalogued. In the process, we have functionally annotated 87% of the Mtb genome in context of gene products. We further combine IPW with STRING based network to report central proteins, which may be assessed as potential drug targets for development of drugs with least possible side effects. The fact that five of the 17 predicted drug targets are already experimentally validated either genetically or biochemically lends credence to our unique approach. © 2012 Vashisht et al.},

abstract={Ionic liquid (IL)-based electrolytes containing molecular solvents were shown to be attractive for extreme temperature applications in electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs). In particular, the IL-butyronitrile (BuCN) mixture provides high capacitance (around 125 F g -1 at 500 mA g -1) independent of testing temperature, and superior performance at high current rates (reduced current dependence at high rates). Importantly, the IL-BuCN electrolyte can safely operate between -20 and + 80 °C, which overcomes the high temperature limitations of current commercial EDLCs. An additional advantage of IL-solvent mixtures is that the higher concentration of IL ions in the mixtures allows a greater specific capacitance (F g -1) to be achieved. The conductivity of the ionic liquid N-butyl-n-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethane sulfonyl) imide (PYR 14TFSI) could be increased from 2.48 mS cm -1 up to 45 mS cm -1 by mixing with an appropriate solvent. Importantly, these solvent mixtures also retain a wide electrochemical voltage window, in the range 4-6 V. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={Energy efficient transferring of packets is a major issue in resource constrained wireless sensor networks. Clustering techniques used for energy efficient data collection works better than the direct transmission in number of cases. Since cluster heads nodes in these schemes are having more responsibilities than the other normal nodes its energy depletes faster than the normal node which affects the stability of the network. In this study, EEGTP protocol is introduced which reduces the energy consumption of the CH by avoiding direct transmission to the base station. Instead of all the CH nodes directly communicating to the base station it data are given to the BS through multi hop communication. The final nodes in the multi hop communication acts as the super aggregator which aggregates the data from all the CH nodes and send it to the base station. In delay insensitive networks EEGTP protocol proves to be more efficient than the other clustering protocols. © 2012 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

abstract={For a long time humans have employed animal sounds to recognize and find them. This paper proposes an automatic sound classification system based on the features extracted from the animal sounds. This paper explores the use of sound analysis algorithms to extract distinct features of different animals. Pitch, formant and short time energy are the features extracted. Support Vector Machine (SVM), a recent classifier is used for classification of animal sounds. It also deals with the comparative performance analysis of pitch by means of Auto Correlation Function (ACF) and Average Magnitude Difference Function (AMDF). More specifically the objective of this paper is to classify animal sounds and to identify the location of animals. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={with the advent of multi Gbits/s speed communication systems, it has become a high priority to develop and implement high speed and efficient error control codes to make the system reliable. Today's error correction codes are mostly based on single algorithm codes which work for a specific conditions and have their own merits and demerits. In this paper two concatenated error control codes are implemented instead of one on an experimental basis. The main idea is to increase the coding gain while maintaining the high reliability of the system. This code has been tested for M-ary modulation schemes. The two concatenated codes such as reed Solomon with convolution codes and turbo convolution codes with convolutional codes were used in this work. The basic scheme is that one code compensates for the shortcomings for the other and vice versa. Such an error control code is robust with the error margin being decreased to a very low value thereby making the communication system in which this scheme is implemented highly reliable. Once such a scheme is made available for consumer products, the speed of transmission can be increased multifold. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={with each and everyone trying to transport their data through the public data networks, today's data communication infrastructure has become more generic that there is absolutely no discrimination between different types of data in the 'transport' plane of communication. This generic nature or the lack of customization leads to the easy sniffing of data by unauthorized entities. This sniffing may not have significant impacts in case of casual data, which has no critical value. But, in case of the classified data, which has a critical value, this sniffing is a significant threat. Thus, it becomes the responsibility of the parties involved in secret communication to arrange for the necessary security, preventing the sniffing by rogue entities. Steganography has become a feasible and efficient alternative to Cryptography because, Steganography camouflages the existence of a security mechanism to protect the data, making it less inquisitive for the rogue parties. In the proposed method, a key-less, efficient and convenient method of embedding a secret data into a colour image is discussed, where the security is completely reliant on the obscuring procedure involved, thereby making the need for a key set unnecessary. The method increases the cryptic effect of the data concealment, making it difficult for any attacker to extract the data. This method is also compared with existing results and found to be good in imperceptibility and capacity. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={The main objective of the paper is to increase the throughput thereby reducing the Network Load and end to end delay between nodes. To achieve this, it is proposed to go for reactive routing protocols. Proactive routing protocols use table-driven strategy that is the routing tables are exchanged periodically between nodes which lead to more bandwidth and power consumption. To overcome these problems, we go for DSR and AODV. These routing protocols use on-demand strategy that is the routes are established from source node to destination only on demand which minimizes the delay and packet loss. Using "Network Simulator 2.35" the performance of AODV and DSR protocols are compared for large number of nodes in the presence of ambient noise level whereas in the existing works lesser number of nodes is only considered. From our results it is evident that AODV protocol consumes lesser power than DSR and in the presence of high network load, AODV outperforms DSR by yielding higher throughput with less delay. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Impact of anthropogenic activities of man and his environment as a result of the growing rate of industrialisation in Tamilnadu, India is of a great concern. The objective of this research was to evaluate the physical properties and heavy metal concentration of soil in different industrial areas. Soil samples were collected from seven industries like welding, cement, steel, printing, textile, paint and tannery which releases heavy metals to environment. Electrical Conductivity (EC), pH, Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC), Organic Matter (OM), Organic Carbon (OC) and heavy metals viz. Cu, Mn, Cr, Pb, Zn and Fe were analysed. Except tannery and steel industry all samples have alkaline pH. The maximum EC 6.41 dSm-1 was noticed in the soil sample collected from textile industry. The results showed that very high level of OC and OM were found in the soil contaminated by printing industry. The soil samples contaminated with cement and printing industries pollutants showed high CEC 26.4 and 38.7 m.eq /100g of soil. Different metals were found to be in higher level in different areas. High level of copper 28.9 ppm is noticed in sample collected from Tannery. The manganese level in increasing order is Textile &lt; Cement &lt; Steel &lt; Painting &lt; Tannery &lt; Welding. The maximum level of iron 46.6 ppm and zinc 13.6 ppm is noticed in sample collected near welding industry. The soil sample of tannery industry showed high level of chromium 32.5 ppm and lead 15.7 ppm. However, comparing these concentrations with those obtained from locations of industrial activity, relatively high levels of heavy metals were recorded, with different industries. Considering all the heavy metals obtained at the study area, Zn, Pb and Cr dominated in all the investigated zones of high industrial impact. This is attributed to the indiscriminate disposal of industrial waste as well as anthropogenic point source contamination. The extremely high contents of the heavy metals generally recorded at the study area are terribly alarming in terms of environmental pollution. Therefore, the inhabitants (mostly children) and the numerous workers, who reside and work at such polluted environment, are at serious risk of heavy metal toxicity and awareness needs to be created as such.},

The sub-micron dispersions exhibited higher thermal conductivity than that of ethylene glycol-water mixture, with the thermal conductivity enhancement varying linearly with particle concentration. An empirical correlation has been developed for the prediction of relative viscosity, whose prediction for 21 data points are within an error of ±2%.},

abstract={Lecithin is a compound composed of fatty acids, triglycerides and phospholipids and lecithin plays a very important role in the field of drug delivery. These are mainly used as carriers or as penetration enhancers in different drug delivery systems, major sources are egg yolk and soya bean oil. Emu bird is one of the largest birds available around the globe and their eggs are huge which contain sufficient quantity of yolk which proves to be a rich source of lecithin. The aim of this work is to isolate lecithin from emu egg and characterize these compounds using different methods like Thin Layer Chromatography, GC-MS and NMR. Emu egg yolk contained significant amount of lecithin and it was confirmed with TLC, GC-MS and NMR spectroscopy. Based on the results obtained from the different techniques, we could conclude that the extracted mass contained compounds of lecithin especially, fatty acid, esters of fatty acids, and some amount of phospholipids. Since the amount of yolk is high in emu egg, more amount of lecithin can be extracted. Hence emu egg can be considered as a feasible source of lecithin. © 2012 RASÄYAN. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The Indian banking sector has been facing serious problems of raising Non- Performing Assets (NPAs). Like a canker worm, NPAs have been eating the banking industries from within, since nationlisation of banks in 1969. NPAs have choked off quantum of credit, restriction the recycling of funds and leads to asset-liability mismatches. It also affected profitability, liquidity and solvency position of the Indian banking sector. One of the major reasons for NPAs in the banking sector is the 'Direct Lending System' by the RBI under social banking motto of the Government, under which scheduled commercial banks are required to lend 40% of their total credit to priority sector. The banks who have advanced to the priority sector and reached the target suffocated on account of raising NPAs, since long. The priority sector NPAs have registered higher growth both in percentage and in absolute terms year after year. The present paper is an attempt to study the priority sector advances by the public, private and foreign bank group-wise, target achieved by them and a comparative study on priority and non-priority sector NPAs over the period of 10 years between 2001-02 and 2010-11. This paper also aims to find out the categories of priority sector advances which contribute to the growth of total priority sector NPAs during the period under study. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2012.},

abstract={Landslides are one of the most frequent natural disasters in Kodaikkanal, India, triggered by the heavy rainfall in the region. There are many techniques to assess landslide susceptibility. This study uses a bivariate probabilistic analysis and entropy index to assess the susceptibility of landslides in the study area using Geographic Information System (GIS) and remotely sensed data. Tevankarai stream sub-watershed of Kodaikkanal is delineated to apply the model and study the influence of various environmental factors on landslide susceptibility. Six environmental factors - slope, aspect, curvature, weathering, soil and land use are extracted from the spatial database constructed using remotely sensed data and topographic maps. These factors are analyzed in relation to the existing landslide database and weight for each factor is determined using the entropy values and information coefficient. The landslide susceptibility map, prepared using this technique is reclassified into five classes showing very low to very high susceptibility classes for planning purposes. This map is validated using a temporal landslide data-set. Landslide density index (R index) increases with the increase in the susceptibility class indicating the acceptability of the landslide susceptibility map generated using this technique. Very high susceptible class pictures the strain of rapid urbanization.},

abstract={India is characterized by people who save money with a high confidence level. The success of investment prospects in India depends on the precise estimation of its potential. With a population of more than one billion of strong work ethic, high levels of education, democracy, communication skills and an entrepreneurial culture, India is supposed to dominate the global economy in the next 20 years. Investment is the sacrifice of certain present value for an uncertain future reward. It involves arriving at a number of decisions such as type, mix, amount, timing and grade of investment and disinvestments. Moreover, such decision-making has not only to be continuous but rational too. Broadly speaking, an investment decisions is a trade-off between risk and return. Since investments in securities are revocable, investment ends are transient and investment environment is fluid. The reliable bases of reasoned expectations become vague as one conceives uncertainty of the distant future. Investors will, therefore, from time to time, reappraise and reevaluate their various investment commitments in the light of new information and changed expectations. Investing has been considered as an activity confined to the rich and business class in the past. This can be attributed to the fact that availability of investible funds is a pre-requisite funds deployment. But, today, the investment has become a household word and is very popular with people from all walks of life. The aim of the study is to get more insight on the investment behavior of individuals based on their demographic factors such as age, gender, income, educational qualification, place and occupational pattern. © Senthil Kumar Kesavan, Vijayabanu Chidambaram, Amudha Ramachandran, 2012.},

Electrospun random and aligned PLGA-PHT fibers were characterized for surface morphology, mechanical property, porosity, degradability, and electrical conductivity.The pore size of random PLGA-PHT nanofibers (6.0 ± 3.3 μm) were significantly higher than the aligned (1.9 ± 0.4 μm) (P&lt;0.05) and the Young's modulus of aligned scaffold was significantly lower than the random. Aligned nanofibers showed significantly lesser degradation rate and higher electrical conductivity (0.1 × 10 -5 S/cm) than random nanofibers (P&lt;0.05).

abstract={The objective of the work is to develop a multiple-unit-type of oral floating drug delivery system to prolong the gastric residence time and increase the bioavailability of weakly acidic drugs, which has absorption window in the gastric region. Floating alginate beads were formulated using Glipizide, an oral anti-diabetic drug as a model. The beads were prepared by dispersing Glipizide with various gas forming agent (Calcium Carbonate, Magnesium Carbonate, Sodium Bicarbonate, Sodium Carbonate, Potassium Bicarbonate and Potassium Carbonate) into sodium alginate solution and then dripping the dispersion into an acidified solution (10% glacial acetic acid) of calcium chloride. The alginate beads were formed due to ionotropic gelation by calcium ions. The carbon dioxide developed from the reaction of carbonate salts with acid permeated through the alginate matrix, to form pores, which provided the beads buoyancy. The beads were evaluated for size, mechanical strength, floating lag time, total floating duration, in-vitro dissolution and release kinetics. The formulations were prepared with different gas forming agents and were optimized for different weight ratios of gas forming agent and sodium alginate. The beads containing higher amounts of Calcium carbonate showed good floating behavior with required release of the drug. The formulation was subjected to In-vivo X-ray studies in healthy maie rabbits which showed the position of beads in the upper part of the stomach. The confirmation of In-vivo floating behavior made them as a suitable candidate for Multiple-Unit Floating Drug Delivery System.},

abstract={Background: Electrical stimulation of fractures has been reported to enhance fracture healing. X-rays are normally used to assess union of fractures. Electrical conduction is not tried as a tool to study fracture healing. The current study focuses on electrical conduction as a diagnostic tool to assess fracture healing and new bone formation. The aim was to find if electrical resistance across the fracture can be used as a tool to study fracture healing which can be verified with simultaneous radiographs. Materials and Methods: A prospective study was conducted where 12 open fractures of tibia, including two with bone defects were evaluated. They were debrided and four-carbon ring Ilizarov external fixators were applied. Their healing was followed with clinical assessment and periodical X-rays till the endpoint of fracture union and then the rings were removed. In addition, all these cases also had application of electrical voltage in the range of 0.1-1.0 V DC in 0.1 V increments, across the two wires on either side of fracture. The output current was recorded by an ammeter connected in series. Resistance calculated for various voltages was plotted as a graph for the period of fracture treatment and the characteristics were studied. This graph was compared with the appearance of new bone in the X-rays. Results: In all cases, when the above graph stabilized, in the consecutive recordings, the X-rays showed healing (bridging callus) matching the curve and the patient was able to load the limb. The time of stabilization of this graph for a specific voltage was different in individual cases. However, for a given case, the resistance characteristics were the same for the entire voltage range of 0.1-1.0 V. Conclusion: If the resistance versus day curve stabilizes on the consecutive recordings, we can predict that the fracture is in the process of healing. This stabilization period also matched the patients' ability to comfortably load the limb and also the radiographs which showed bridging callus (healing). If this is used as a positive criterion for fracture healing in future, the radiation exposure by X-rays shall be less.},

abstract={Orlistat is an anti- obesity drug, that preventing the digestion and absorption of fat in food. Aqueous solubility of this drug is very less, but freely soluble in ethanol and methanol. It is available as hard gelatin capsules administered in the dose of 60 - 120 mg with the dosing frequency as 3 times a day. It shows half life of 1 to 2 hours with poor bioavailability of less than 1%. The present work is involved in the formulation of microspheres of Orlistat with the suitable doses for sustaining the release, which aims to reduce the dosing frequency dose frequency, side effects and enhance the bioavailability. The Orlistat microspheres were prepared by solvent evaporation method with hydrophobic ethyl cellulose polymer for retarding the drug release at various concentrations of drug - polymer ratio (1:1, 1:3, 1:5 and 1:7) in the presence of different surfactants such as tween 80 (0.3%) and pluronic F68 (0.2%). The formulated microspheres were evaluated for its particle size distribution (2.322 μm to 5.663 μm), drug content (95-99%) and drug entrapment efficiency (98.89%). The infrared spectroscopy analysis supported to the above data and confirms that there were no interactions between the drug and polymer. The in-vitro drug release (58.25% - 62.32%) was carried out using 200ml of phosphate buffer pH 7.4 as the dissolution media by using USP type I(basket) dissolution test apparatus at 75 rpm. The mechanism of the drug release was identified using release kinetic models like Higuchi, Peppas, Hixon, zero order and first order kinetics. The Orlistat microspheres are found to have sustained release of drug for more than 12 hours.},

abstract={In India's indigenous system of medicine, Coriandrum sativum (CS), commonly used as a food ingredient, is claimed to be useful for various ailments. To establish its utility in diabetes mellitus, the present study evaluated the antidiabetic and antioxidant effects of CS in alloxan-induced diabetic rats. The extracts were shown to contain bioactive compounds including phenolics, flavonoids, steroids, and tannins. The extracts of CS in alloxan-induced diabetic rats were found to significantly lower blood glucose levels. Antidiabetic activity of the CS extracts was compared with the clinically available drug glibenclamide. The levels of serum total cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were lower in the extract-treated group and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was higher than the diabetic control rats. The extracts of CS exhibited strong scavenging effect on 2, 2-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl free radical and inhibition of lipid peroxidation. The free radical scavenging effect of the extracts was comparable with that of the reference antioxidants. Furthermore, it also showed an improved antioxidant potential as evidenced by decreased lipid peroxidation and a significant increase in the activity of various antioxidant enzymes such as catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase in the liver of diabetic rats. These results indicate that the extracts could protect liver function and exhibited hypoglycemic, hypolipidemic, and antioxidant efficacies in the diabetic rats. These results support the use of this plant extract to manage diabetes mellitus. © 2012 Institute of Food Technologists ®.},

abstract={Testing a given circuit is a very important issue in today's situation due to high test cost. Tester mainly focuses on power dissipation and test data volume. Compression technique is implemented to reduce test power which causes the chip failure and is also used to reduce test data size. This study discusses reduction of test data and scan chain shift-in power. Proposed method on compressing test data is done by threshold method for unspecified test patterns. Appropriate indexing and encoding is done in this method. An analysis of shift in power is carried out for encoded compressed pattern by considering its switching activity. Experimental results prove that the proposed method can produce rapid reduction in test data volume and shiftin power. © Maxwell Scientific Organization, 2012.},

So, for secured data transmission we make use of steganography. This is the art of hiding information where the existence of data is unknown. Any medium like music, video, text, speech, etc can be used. In this study, the selected medium is audio. This study discusses about the existing audio steganographic techniques along with their advantages and limitations. Also an algorithm implementing parity and LSB methods is proposed.

abstract={Sri Yantra is one of the most auspicious, important and powerful Yantras, which not only gives the maximum benefit, but also proves beneficial for almost everybody. The traditional methods for drawing Sri Yantra are complex. It is very difficult to obtain Sri Yantra with full accuracy. The objective of this study is to define algorithmic approach for generating Sri Yantra with maximum accuracy. The accuracy is measured through the parameters like Concurrency, Concentricity and Equilateral. It is the source of attaining all worldly desires and fulfilling all wishes through inner cosmic power and mental strength. "Sri Yantra" - Sri means wealth and Yantra-means "Instrument"-"The Instrument for Wealth". The Instrument for Wealth the Sri Yantra brings about material and spiritual wealth Sri Yantra blesses the worshiper with peace, happiness, popularity, power, authority, wealth, prosperity and success. Leaders and men in authority should use this Yantra for attaining fame, power and financial benefits. Sri Yantra is definitely the answer to all the problems and negativity in our life. Existing edition of seven by seven grids had erroneous descriptions Sri Yantra, according to the latest English translation. Unfortunately, that one two is marred with errors in diagrams and unclear reference to inside-out construction instructions for the drawing of the triangular central pattern. There is no systematic approach to draw a traditional Sri Yantra. The methods used to generate Yantra in previous studies are approximate and not producing accurate design. This study presents a clear algorithmic approach to construct the Sri Yantra. This study mainly focuses to produce highest level of accuracy and construct the optimal configuration of Sri Yantra. © Maxwell Scientific Organization, 2012.},

Angular distortion is a major problem and most pronounced among different types of distortion in butt welded plates. The process control parameters chosen for the study are welding gun angle, welding speed, plate length, welding current and gas flow rate. The experiments were conducted using design of experiments technique with five factor five level central composite rotatable design with full replication technique. A mathematical model was developed correlating the process parameters with angular distortion. A source code was developed in MATLAB 7.6 to do the optimization. The optimal process parameters gave a value of 0.0305° for angular distortion which demonstrates the accuracy of the model developed. The results indicate that the optimized values for the process parameters are capable of producing weld with minimum distortion. ©School of Engineering, Taylor's University.},

abstract={Ethnopharmacological relevance: Lauha bhasma (iron ash) is one of the iron-based herbo-metallic preparations used in Ayurvedic medicine for treating various ailments due to iron deficiency. Materials and methods: The preparation of Lauha bhasma (iron ash) requires normal purification (heat treatment in vegetable and animal products), special purification (treatment with herbal constituents) and calcination steps aimed at converting the raw material to a suitable therapeutic form. In this study, we have systematically and scientifically evaluated through a series of qualitative tests and modern analytical tools the importance of the treating media. Results: Our data demonstrates that these steps are necessary to remove the grease and scales in the raw material. While heating, microcracks appeared on the surface of the iron, which improved the reactivity with the herbal constituents in addition to incorporating nanostructured features. Further, the use of plant products facilitated the removal of Fe 3+ present in the raw material by forming soluble complexes. The Fe 2+ present in the raw materials also forms an insoluble complex with the herbal constituents in the presence of UV radiation. Conclusions: In conclusion, our data summarily suggest that the purification steps involved in the preparation of Lauha bhasma (iron ash) are critical. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Hepatic marker enzymes like aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total proteins and total bilirubin were analysed in serum. Lipid peroxidation marker mainly thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and antioxidant enzymes namely superoxide dismutase (SOD), reduced glutathione (GSH), glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activities were studied. The extract produced significant (p<0.05) protective effect by decreasing the elevated liver marker enzymes, total bilirubin, lipid peroxidation marker and ameliorated the diminished serum total protein as well as antioxidant levels in a dose dependent manner. The present study suggest that leaf extract of A. aspera offers protection against oxidative stress and its ability might be attributed to its antioxidant potential.},

abstract={Steganography's role in secret communication extends from concealing information to communication. As one of several possible approaches to embed confidential information in digital images, the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique has been widely used; however, maintaining the imperceptibility of the stego-image is still a serious concern. In this paper, an Adaptive Random (AR) k-bit embedding approach has been attempted to enhance the quality of stego-images. The original cover is divided into nonoverlapping blocks of equal size. The encrypted confidential data are embedded in each block through four different random walks. The best random walk, which provides the minimum degradation for a particular block, is identified, and is fixed for that block. The decision on the fixed random walk for each block is recorded and kept as the secret key. The AR method has also been combined with the Inverted Pattern approach, referred to as the Adaptive Random Inverted Pattern (ARIP) approach, to further enhance the quality of the stego-image. The estimated Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) value for the ARIP method yields 1 dB enhancement. © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Study of viscosity of vegetable oils is an important engineering parameter for designing processing equipment. The rheological and thermal degradation in unheated and heated rice bran oil, mustard oil, sesame oil and groundnut oil is studied as a function of temperature (30 to 90 °C) using temperature controlled redwood viscometer. The viscosity decreased with increasing temperature at different rates depending on the saturated and unsaturated fatty acid composition of the oils. Some experimental relations that describe the temperature dependence of viscosity are fitted to experimental data and correlation constants are studied. The amount of polyunsaturated chains is better correlated (R 2 = 0.896) with viscosity than monounsaturated chains. The content of unsaturated fatty acids has good correlation (R 2 = 0.867) with viscosity than saturated fatty acids (R 2 = 0.747) for unheated oils and heated oils. It is observed that the viscosity of heated (to smoke point 210-250 °C) oil sample is greater than unheated oil due to increase in the content of saturated composite in the oil on heating.},

abstract={Probioticated carrot and watermelon juices were produced using four different strains of lactic acid bacteria [Lactobacillus plantarum MTCC1407, Lactobacillus rhamnosus MTCC1408, Lactobacillus casei MTCC1423, Lactobacillus lactis MTCC911]. The watermelon and carrot juices were pasteurized for 30 minutes at 63°C and was inoculated with a 24h culture of individual lactobacilli and incubated at 37°C. Changes in pH, acidity, sugar content, and viable cell count during fermentation under controlled condition were measured. All of the lactobacilli were capable of growing in watermelon and carrot juices and reached a cell density of 107 CFU/ml after 48h incubation at 37°C. Overnight cultures of Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella dysenteriae and Bacillus cereus were added to probioticated juices and reduction of viable cells were assayed. The viable cell counts of the four-lacticacid bacteria in the fermented carrot and watermelon juices ranged from 107 to 109 CFU/ml and 108-109 CFU/ml respectively. Antimicrobial activities of the lactobacilli cells against the test strains were also determined by measuring the diameter of growth inhibition zones. Among all the four lactic acid bacteria Lactobacillus casei was the most potent inhibitor of all the tested intestinal pathogens such as Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella dysenteriae, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens and Escherichia coli.},

abstract={This review aims to explore the toxicological aspects of mercury-based herbo-metallic preparations like cinnabar and "Rasasindura" that are primarily composed of mercuric sulfide (HgS). Cinnabar-containing preparations have been used extensively in Indian and Chinese systems of medicine for treatment of chronic ailments like syphilis, high fever, pneumonia, insomnia, nervous disorders, deafness, and paralysis of the tongue. Contrary to Western medicine, which does not promote the use of mercury due to its toxic effects, Indian and Chinese traditional practitioners believe that mercury-based formulations have potent therapeutic efficacy, while there is no toxicity due to the unique and repeated purification processes employed during preparation. However, lack of proper pharmacovigilance and widespread self-medication has resulted in undesirable effects to certain sections of the consumers of these preparations, which have contributed to the negative publicity for these forms of medicine. Variations in the quality of the preparations coupled with the lack of understanding of the differences in the recommended dosages and treatment strategies adopted by traditional medicine practitioners, further fuels concerns in the Western world on the safety and efficacy of traditional medicine. But in spite of these concerns, concerted efforts to understand the biological interactions and transformations of these preparations are yet to gain momentum. Although scattered reports on the toxicity of these preparations are available in literature, their mechanism of action has not been conclusively established. Long-term pharmacotherapeutic and in-depth toxicity studies are needed to address the apprehensions raised by these herbo-metallic preparations. This review highlights the lacunae in the studies conducted thus far, and assesses the need for further studies to provide significant data to establish the safety and efficacy of such preparations, as well as develop gold standards for stringent quality control of these preparations. © Springer-Verlag 2012.},

We, herein, describe a computational tool, CIntX, which calculates the k rc of labile protons in proteins at defined experimental conditions such as pH, temperature, solvents and ionic strength using three-dimensional structures of the proteins. The program also accounts structural parameters (amino acid sequence, cis-trans proline conformations, disulfide bonds and ionisable groups in the proteins) influencing the k rc of labile protons in a fully automated manner. The robustness of the tool on predicting the k rc of labile protons in proteins has been validated using data reported in the literature.

Frying is widely used in food industry and household cooking which leads to degradation of oil that induces important chemical changes in oils, specifically oxidation, polymerization, isomerism, hydrolysis and cyclization. Effective control over the limitation of the above reaction is technically done by the simplest way of the natural antioxidant in the oil. Antioxidants reduce the oxidative stress in cells damage and health problems including cancers, degenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases, inflammatory diseases etc. This study reveals the stability and efficiency of natural antioxidants present in sunflower oil, groundnut oil, soya bean oil palm oil, sesame oil, rice bran oil and corn oil and the changes on heating.},

abstract={Objective: To evaluate pharmacological mimetic action of herbal extract . Desmodium gangeticum (DG) roots on ischemia reperfusion injury. Methods: With the help of Langendroff perfusion technique, ischemic post condition (POC) mimetic action of DG methanol root extract was evaluated and compared by using standard drugs that acts as muscarinic receptor agonist and antagonist, namely acetylcholine (Ach) and atropine (Atr) respectively in an isolated rat heart. Results: The physiological parameters like left ventricular developed pressure, end diastolic pressure and working index of isolated rat heart showed significant recovery in DG root extract administrated rat heart, similar to the recovery by POC. Kymogram results showed muscarinic receptor agonist like action for DG methanol root extract, confirmed in rat heart by muscarnic receptor agonist (acetylcholine) and anatoginst (atropine). Administration of DG root extract prior to reperfusion showed better antioxidant status in myocardial tissue homogenate and mitochondrial, complemented by the levels of cardiac specific marker proteins in myocardial tissue and perfusate. Even though DG methanol root extract mimics its action similar to that of Ach, the myocardial protection mediated by the extract was superior to Ach, due to the presence of antioxidants in the crude extract. Conclusions: DG methanol root extract provides myocardial protection towards IRI by stimulating muscarinic receptors. © 2012 Hainan Medical College.},

A numerical model has been developed for computation of different noise components in nanoscale FinFET. The drain current channel thermal noise under illuminated conditions is calculated. The noise parameters of the nanoscale FinFET equivalent circuit are strongly influenced by the incident optical signal and the quantum mechanical effects are found to play a major role in determining the overall noise performance of the device. It also reveals that the operating frequency can be adjusted suitably to make the noise behavior independent of the incident optical power. Other noise components such as Shot noise, thermal noise and diffusion noise have been calculated for the two port FinFET photodetector.

abstract={Purpose: Novel strategies are being applied for creating better in vitro models that simulate in vivo conditions for testing the efficacy of anticancer drugs. In the present study we developed surface-engineered, large and porous, biodegradable, polymeric microparticles as a scaffold for three dimensional (3-D) growth of a Y79 retinoblastoma (RB) cell line. We evaluated the effect of three anticancer drugs in naïve and nanoparticle-loaded forms on a 3-D versus a two-dimensional (2-D) model. We also studied the influence of microparticles on extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis and whole genome miRNA-gene expression profiling to identify 3D-responsive genes that are implicated in oncogenesis in RB cells. Methods: Poly(D,L)-lactide-co-glycolide (PLGA) microparticles were prepared by the solvent evaporation method. RB cell line Y79 was grown alone or with PLGA-gelatin microparticles. Antiproliferative activity, drug diffusion, and cellular uptake were studied by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, a yellow tetrazole (MTT) assay, fluorescent microscope, and flow cytometry. Extra cellular matrix (ECM) synthesis was observed by collagenase assay and whole genome miRNA-microarray profiling by using an Agilent chip. Results: With optimized composition of microparticles and cell culture conditions, an eightfold increase from the seeding density was achieved in 5 days of culture. The antiproliferative effect of the drugs in the 3-D model was significantly lower than in the 2-D suspension, which was evident from the 4.5 to 21.8 fold differences in their IC50 values. Using doxorubicin, the flow cytometry data demonstrated a 4.4 fold lower drug accumulation in the cells grown in the 3-D model at 4 h. The collagen content of the cells grown in the 3-D model was 2.3 fold greater than that of the cells grown in the 2- D model, suggesting greater synthesis of the extracellular matrix in the 3-D model as the extracellular matrix acted as a barrier to drug diffusion. The microarray and miRNA analysis showed changes in several genes and miRNA expression in cells grown in the 3-D model, which could also influence the environment and drug effects. Conclusions: Our 3-D retinoblastoma model could be used in developing effective drugs based on a better understanding of the role of chemical, biologic, and physical parameters in the process of drug diffusion through the tumor mass, drug retention, and therapeutic outcome. © 2012 Molecular Vision.},

abstract={Ayurveda is an ancient traditional system of medicine, which has been evolved and practised in India for several centuries. Metals used in herbo- metallic preparations (HMP) (bhasmas) are purified by repeated treatment with plant extracts and animal products. Horse gram extract (kulatha kasaya) is used in the initial stages of purification of iron in the preparation of Lauha bhasma. In this work, we have evaluated the role of gallic acid, which is one of the major constituents of kulatha in the purification of iron. Various physico-chemical techniques such as UV-Vis spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermal analysis and scanning electron microscopy were used to characterize the gallic acid-metal complex. Our results demonstrate that gallic acid readily formed a complex with iron(III) chloride through the phenolic groups; the carboxylic acid group of gallic acid was not involved in the coordination with the metal ion. Further, the gallic acid-metal complex was soluble in water and thus the treatment of iron with kulatha kasaya, results in the formation of water-soluble complex, which is removed during repeated washing. Thus we have established for the first time the scientific basis of using kulatha kasaya in the purification of iron and have demonstrated that during this process the trivalent iron, which is present in the raw material is removed thereby reducing the iron(III) content in the Ayurvedic preparation.},

The crude protein sample from the Cicer arietinum L. was isolated by two step ammonium sulphate precipitation method. The dialysed sample was purified on cation exchange (CM-Sepharose) chromatography column. After isolating by column chromatography, identification of lectin was carried out by comparing with other plant lectins. The eluted fractions containing lectin were collected from the column and then used for hemagglutination activity study. The hemagglutination activity of various protein fractions were performed using peripheral human erythrocytes. Antioxidant activity of the lectin containing fraction was derived from free radical scavenging ability and the results indicated that adaptogenic activity of lectin from Cicer arietinum could be attributed to its antioxidant potential.},

abstract={Vanga bhasma is a tin-based herbo-metallic preparation, prescribed for urinary disorders and general debility. The practitioners of Ayurveda had devised a series of steps to convert bio-incompatible metallic raw material (tin) to a bio-compatible form (Vanga bhasma). These include (i) Purification of metallic ingredients by normal purification using five different treating liquids in series (ii) Special purification by trituration of purified metal with herbal extracts (iii) Calcination to prepare fine powders. Characterization of intermediates obtained at different stages highlight the gradual reduction in mass percentage of tin during puta, which is attributed to the formation of complexes with the organic moieties present in the treating agents. Also, with successive puta steps, decrease in particle size and the increase in BET surface area were observed. Lower particle size and increased surface area are expected to improve bioavailability of Vanga bhasma.},

abstract={Gandhaga parpam is a Siddha formulation prescribed for the treatment of leucoderma, eczema, stomach disorders, venereal chronic diseases, poisonous bites and rheumatic fever. Gandhaga parpam has been prepared following the methods described in the ancient texts. The first step is the purification of crude sulphur, in which the crude sulphur is added to a mixture of curd & henna, placed in a sarava samputa and heated using cow dung cakes. This is repeated seven times. A maximum temperature of 350 °C is reached during heating in about 3 hours. The purified sulphur is triturated with Allium sativam extract for about 15 times, followed by tirturation with Zingiber officinale for 15 times. The paste is made into pellets and dried under sun, followed by heating with ash of Terminalia arjuna bark for about 18 hours. The intermediates obtained during each purification step were characterized for morphology, elemental composition and crystallinity using scanning electron Microscopy, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy and X-ray diffractometry. Our studies show that a properly prepared Gandhaga parpam exhibits a morphology comprising nanoscale features. Calcium (46.66%) is found to be the major component in the product. This is attributed to burning with ash of Terminalia arjuna bark which contains calcium in higher concentration. Increased levels of potassium, chlorine, magnesium, silicon, iron, aluminium has also been observed. Phosphorus, strontium, sodium, tin, lead zinc, copper, bromine have been incorporated in the product due to the addition of garlic and ginger. Titanium and molybdenum are absent in the product, while the levels of lead and bromine are well below the permissible limit.},

abstract={Naga bhasma, a lead based herbo-metallic preparation has been used in treating various ailments such as diabetes mellitus, diarrhea, skin and spleen diseases. The major elements of naga bhasma are lead and sulphur, while trace elements include calcium, potassium and phosphorous. A detailed study on the physico-chemical characteristics of naga bhasma is required to allay fears on its toxicity owing to the presence of heavy metals. However, as per Ayurveda, the toxic character of metallic ingredients is eliminated due to scrupulous purification and calcination steps. But, with different manufacturers adopting various procedures for preparation, the characterization of the bhasma using modern analytical tools, apart from classical tests like varitara and niruttha becomes essential. Naga bhasma samples from three different batches from the same manufacturer were procured and analyzed. Niruttha test confirmed the absence of free metal in the bhasma. Thermogravimetry analysis showed that naga bhasma sample was thermally stable until 900 o C, indicating the absence of free organic molecules. The FTIR spectra revealed that all the samples contained organic moieties probably in the form of a complex. Particle size and surface area analysis of the naga bhasma samples indicated the presence of micron-sized particles. Elemental analysis indicated the presence of arsenic impurity in the samples. Electron microscopy studies revealed that bhasma contained particles in micron &amp; sub-micron ranges. Energy dispersive X-ray Analysis too showed the presence of arsenic along with Lead. XRD showed the lead oxide phase in all three samples.},

abstract={Cancer is a deadly disease resulting due to abnormal growth of cells in our body. Four most frequent serious cancers identified are lung, breast, colorectal & stomach. Existing modern lines of treatment for these cancers are causing serious side effects; hence there is a need to develop human friendly anti cancer drugs. In this connection traditional drug sources could be useful sources for developing safe efficacious human compatible anticancer drugs. Lamiaceous members are proven for the presence of anti cancer compounds such as terpenes, royleanones etc.With a view to develop an anti cancer drug a lamiaceaeous member botanically equated as Anisochilus carnosus is selected and subjected to chemical and invitro toxicity studies, besides scientific evaluation of the antimicrobial potential of the test drug is also carried out. GC MS Analysis was carried out to identify the compounds of the selected drug and In silico studies carried out to assess the anticancer potential. Preliminary phytochemical screening of ethanol extract of Anisochilus carnosus was carried out. Extract answered positively for the presence of alkaloids, sterol, and quinone. Ethanolic extract of the selected plant was evaluated for its antitumor efficacy against Ehrlich ascites carcinoma employing invitro methods. Data of the results obtained revealed high cell death rate in higher concentration. Compounds present in the ethanol extract of Anisochilus carnosus were analyzed using GC-MS. 45 compounds were identified. Compounds selected were subjected to antimicrobial activity studies and found to be more effective against staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeuoroginosa. Besides the compounds identified in the extract of the test drug were also docked with Bcl-2 protein using modeler software and pymol. Auto dock tool was used for analysis of docking stimulations.},

abstract={Asclepiadaceae includes predominantly climbers and straggling vines. The members of this taxon possess many bioactive constituents such as triterpenes, alkaloids, cyanogenetic glycoside, saponins, tannins and cyclitols. In the present work Pentatropis capensis (L.f) Bullock a herbaceous vine of the family called "uppilian kodi" in Tamil is studied from pharmacognostic standardization point of view. Most of the genera of Asclepiadaceae exhibit striking similarities in growth form, floral organization and other external features, so, it is a prerequisite for a herbalist to emanate certain microscopic standards to establish the identity of the plants and to segregate the selected plant from its co-existing plants with simulating identity. The present study deals with the pharmacognostic aspect of Pentatropis capensis to highlight its botanical parameters, particularly microscopic standards to establish the identity of the drug in its crude form. Especially those features that are least affected by environmental stress are given accent in the present study. Cross sectional structure of the midrib and lamina, surface features of the epidermis and stomata, Venation pattern of the lamina, cross-sectional outline and vascular pattern of the petiole and structure of tissues in the stem and root are brought under the present preview. The validity of the result of the study in employing for the botanical identity of Pentatropis capensis is critically discussed. Preliminary phytochemical screening and fluorescence features were also studied for the crude drug and reported. Inorganic, organic and biochemical standards were also determined for the drug under study. These chemical and biochemical standards coupled with salient microscopic standards determined in the present work will certainly help in the unequivocal identity of the drug in the crude form.},

abstract={E-Learning has definite benefits over traditional classroom training. For E-Learning, various ELearning Tools have been proposed. However, users need to wait for long time to get response from Knowledge Database, which is called as E-Learning Data Server, if many users are online. And providing security to this E-Server is a challenging one. To address these issues, this work has proposed an efficient E-Learning Model through Smart Firewall Load Balancing Technique. Firewall is a device which is designed to permit or deny network transmissions based upon a set of rules and is frequently used to protect networks from unauthorized access while permitting legitimate communications to pass. Many personal computer Operating Systems contains software-based firewalls which is used to protect the system against threats from the public Internet. Many Routers that pass data between Networks contain firewall components and, conversely, many firewalls can perform basic routing functions. Existing Firewall Technologies such as Cisco PIX Firewalls and Checkpoint FireWall-1 provide various software tools that allowing firewalls as Clustered or Grouped and these Configured Firewalls will share their loads. The main objectives of the existing technologies are to improve the Resource Utilization along with performance and Security. This is one of the serious problems. ie the required performance can't be achieved. This research work is introduced a Adaptive Scheduler, which focuses both the Performance and Security along with Resource Utilization, and also this proposed approach reduced the firewall rules, which minimize the delay and hence this proposed work improved the Throughput, which improved the E-Server Performance in terms of Throughput, Delay and Security Strength. © Maxwell Scientific Organization, 2012.},

abstract={Web Services are mounting as an inventive mechanism for rendering services to subjective devices over the WWW. As a consequence of the rapid growth of Web Services applications and the plenty of Service Providers, the consumer is facing with the inevitability of selecting the "right" Service Provider. In such a scenario the Quality of Service (QoS) serves as a target to differentiate Service Providers. To select the best Web Services / Service Providers, Ranking and Optimization of Web Service Compositions are challenging areas of research with significant implications for the realization of the "Web of Services" revelation. The "Semantic Web Services" use formal semantic descriptions of Web Service functionality and interface to enable automated reasoning over Web Service Compositions. This study from its experimental results revealed that the existing Semantic Web Services faces a few challenging issues such as poor prediction of best Web Services and optimized Service Providers, which leads to QoS degradation of Semantic Web. To address and overcome these identified issues, this research work is calculating the semantic similarities, utilization of various Web Services and Service Providers. After measuring these parameters, all the Web Services are ranked based on their Utilization. Finally, our proposed technique, selected best Web Services based on their ranking and placed in Web Services Composition. From the experimental results, it is established that our proposed mechanism improves the performance of Semantic Web in terms of Execution Time, Processor Utilization and Memory Management. © Maxwell Scientific Organization, 2012.},

abstract={A biological sequence is a single, continuous molecule of nucleic acid or protein. Classical methods for the Multiple Longest Common Subsequence problem (MLCS) problem are based on dynamic programming. The Multiple Longest Common Subsequence problem (MLCS) is used to find the longest subsequence shared between two or more strings. For over 30 years, significant efforts have been made to find efficient algorithms for the MLCS problem. Many of them have been proposed for the general case of any given number of strings. They could benefit greatly from improving their computation times. (Qingguo et al.,) proposed a new algorithm for the general case of Multiple LCS problem, which is finding the LCS of any number of strings. This algorithm is based on the dominant point approach and employs a fast divide-and-conquers technique to compute the dominant points. From this existing work, it is observed that, when this approach is applied to a case of three strings, this algorithm demonstrates the same performance as the fastest existing MLCS algorithm. When applied to more than three strings, this technique is significantly faster than the existing sequential methods, reaching up to 2-3 orders of magnitude faster speed on large-size problems. However, from our experimental results, it is observed that as the size of the Data Set is increasing, its performance decreases in terms of execution time. To overcome this major issue, we have developed an efficient model called Cache Oblivious based Multiple Longest Common Subsequence (CMLCS). From our experimental results, it is observed that our proposed work performs better as compared with the existing system in terms of Execution Time and Memory Usage. © Maxwell Scientific Organization, 2012.},

abstract={Information overload is the most important problem when searching biomedical databases. This paper gives the solutions for information overload and the navigation cost. Categorization and ranking manage the information overload. Automatic categorization system can generate their own sets of categories through the use of clustering. First, user gives the query and they group the search results into separate categories. Second the categorized results are ranked according to the user interest. The retrieved ranking result will produce the static and dynamic tree structure. Finally, the gen-reduced tree algorithm reduces the navigation cost when compared with the opt-edgecut algorithm. The comparison result produces the overall navigation cost for the user interest. © Maxwell Scientific Organization, 2012.},

During testing, the power dissipation will be high due to very high number of toggles between test vectors. Hence power minimization is significant during testing. X bits in the test vectors are identified and then X bits are replaced with their appropriate values. The filled vector set is next reordered. In this study, Kruskal based approach is proposed for reordering the vector to minimize the number of toggles and hence power consumption.

abstract={The aim of this study is to design a software tool for lifetime estimation for Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) applications simulated using Global Mobile System Simulator (GloMoSim). WSN are emerging because of the developments in wireless communication technology and miniaturization of the hardware. The solutions developed for WSN applications focus more on maximizing the lifetime of the network. The parameters such as number of nodes, data rate, MAC protocols, sampling rate, etc., influence the lifetime of a WSN application. In this paper, a sophisticated GUI based software tool called WECalc: Wireless Energy Calculator is designed to accept user inputs and to invoke GloMoSim. The advantages of WECalc tool are threefold. 1. Easy simulation of WSN applications through this GUI. 2. Flexible changes to various parameters that influence the lifetime and calculation of network lifetime prior to real time deployment. 3. A value addition to GloMoSim for WSN applications. The designed tool was experimented with changes in number of nodes, node position, MAC protocol, routing protocol, traffic pattern, etc., and the network lifetime was calculated which extends the utility of GloMoSim to WSN applications also. From the results obtained using this tool, it is observed that the MAC protocol with RTS-CTS mechanism performs well and routing protocol with on-demand route establishment mechanism increases the lifetime in WSN applications. Also, lifetime of the network depends on number of nodes involved in the path between source to sink and network lifetime is reduced when the sampling rate is increased. © Maxwell Scientific Organization, 2012.},

abstract={In this study an Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System is introduced to select the switching states of Matrix Converters. Matrix converters have received more attention in research and industrial application due its advantages like four quadrant operation, sinusoidal input and output waveforms, controllable displacement factor, less number of switches etc., Matrix Converters are efficient in speed control of Induction motors than the conventional converters. There are two different control techniques namely field oriented control and Direct Torque Control systems available for closed loop operation of induction motors. The Direct Torque Control technique provides control of torque and flux directly. The major drawback of Direct Torque Control technique is the presence of ripples in torque and flux curves. This due to the presence of two level and three level hysteresis controllers in torque and flux control stages respectively. Also the conventional space vector and look up table method of switching state selection reduces the accuracy of switch state selection in the appropriate time width. This reduces the speed control performance of the motor. Also in this paper the hysteresis controllers are replaced by fuzzy controllers. the complete ANFIS based DTC for Matrix Converter is simulated in MATLAB/SIMULINK and the results shows that the use of Adaptive neuro fuzzy inference in Matrix Converter system increases the speed control performance of Induction Motor. © Maxwell Scientific Organization, 2012.},

abstract={The influence of dopant precursor (manganese (II) acetate tetrahydrate) concentration on structural, morphological, optical and vapour sensing properties of zinc oxide (ZnO) was studied by fabricating manganese (Mn) doped ZnO thin films with various Mn 2+ concentration, using spray pyrolysis technique. The as-deposited films were found to be polycrystalline in nature, with hexagonal wurtzite structure. A rope-like morphology was observed through secondary electron (SE) image. The I-V characteristics depict a decrease in electrical resistance with an increase in concentration levels of Mn 2+. The optical band gap decreased from 3.45 eV to 1.9 eV, on increase in Mn 2+ concentration from 0.002 M, 0.004 M and 0.006 M (Mn1, Mn2 and Mn3 samples) in 0.05 M of zinc acetate dihydrate. The vapour sensing behaviour of the films was observed for various concentrations of trimethylamine (TMA) and ethanol at an optimized operating temperature of 373 K. The sensor response for TMA was found to be more appreciable in comparison with the response towards ethanol. The response of TMA at 75 ppm was calculated to be 300, with a response and recovery time of 11 s and 20 s respectively. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The stereoscopic process to attain 3D is done by obtaining the disparity and depth map of the images. Using this disparity' the mesh is created for the face which is used as a proof for accurate identification. We go for 3D to increase the efficiency of the biometric systems.

abstract={A CAPTCHA an acronym for "completely automated public Turing test to tell computers and humans apart" is a challenge-response test which is used in web pages to determine whether the user is human. The CAPTCHA is mostly made of distorted image which might contain alpha-numeric letters in them. The CAPTCHA was brought up to avoid automatic form submission done by the spam bots. In this paper we are designing an Intelligence algorithm to showcase the vulnerabilities which are still available in them. The intelligence program created consist of three main modules namely noise removal, segmentation and classification. We go for noise removal as the CAPTCHA is present in the form of image. In the segmentation process we segment the characters present. During classification we compare the segmented characters using the templates created already and then print the output.},

abstract={Culture and Tradition are the basis for strong family ties in India. The bondage is also realized among communities identified by similar caste, religion, faith, gender, location etc. This social relationship with the potential of providing economic benefits to each community member by their collective contribution has been termed as Social Capital. Social Capital is a concept which is gaining attention among many sociologists in the recent past due to the positive benefit it can render to members beyond the potential of their other assets. India, an economically fast developing country is haunted by the imbalance in growth between its urban and rural regions. The rural Indians who primarily depend on agriculture contribute vastly to the under developed, poor and most vulnerable population of the country. The various benefit schemes from the government and many restructuring in the institutionalized rural credit delivery system have not done enough to support the capital requirements of these poor rural artisans. This narrative research provides insights in to 'Moi Virundhu' (meaning Community feast for fund raising), a more than 50 year old community initiative practiced for raising funds to meet the consumption requirements of its members. The borrowing member does not present any collateral, and contribution by members is based only on faith due to the social relationship. 'Moi Virundhu' is a unique community initiative practiced only in a few villages of Thanjavur District in Tamil Nadu and could be a model for understanding Social Capital benefits. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2012.},

abstract={Current liver transplntation strategies face severe shortcomings owing to scarcity of donors, immunogenicity, prohibitive costs and poor survival rates. Due to the lengthy list of patients requiring transplant, high mortality rates are observed during the endless waiting period. Tissue engineering could be an alternative strategy to regenerate the damaged liver and improve the survival and quality of life of the patient. The development of an ideal scaffold for liver tissue engineering depends on the nature of the scaffold, its architecture and the presence of growth factors and recognition motifs. Biomimetic scaffolds can simulate the native extracellular matrix for the culture of hepatocytes to enable them to exhibit their functionality both in vitro and in vivo. This review highlights the physiology and pathophysiology of liver, the current treatment strategies, use of various scaffolds, incorporation of adhesion motifs, growth factors and stem cells that can stabilize and maintain hepatocyte cultures for a long period. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Recycled aggregate (RA) obtained from crushed concrete rubble, instead of being stored, can be reused in building industry. An attempt has been made to study the possibility of reusing the recycled concrete aggregate from demolished structures in the place of fresh aggregate. Four series of mixes of control concrete with fresh aggregate and recycled concrete aggregate with three different ages of 5, 10, and 15 years were prepared for the present study and used with three different combinations, 0% fly ash, 20% fly ash, and 20% fly ash with super plasticizer. The basic properties of aggregates, such as water absorption and specific gravity, mechanical properties, such as abrasion resistance, effect, and crushing values were considered. Workability of fresh concrete and strength parameters of hardened concrete, such as compressive strength and tensile strength, were studied. The preceding properties were tested for three different periods of curing of 7, 14, and 28 days. All these mixes were designed for M25 grade of concrete. In the present work, a comparison was made between the results of a laboratory investigation on various physical properties of concrete made with recycled aggregate concrete with fresh aggregate concrete and found that the results are encouraging to use concrete with RA. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract={Computers have invaded all premises of the human world, starting from a grocery store to a missile launching center. Because of the omnipresence of computers, it becomes more and more difficult eveiyday to secure the confidential information from misuse. The fairly common technique of cryptography has been proved inadequate in recent years. Steganography, a contemporary yet an age-old technique to hide secret data into an unsuspected cover media like an image, thereby preventing the recognition of the veiy presence of secret data, is an alternative. In this study, an improved image steganographic approach is proposed. This method reduces the mean square error (MSE) by localizing the error-reduction process to eveiy row. The error reduction is performed by selective embedding of the actual secret, its binary complement, gray-coded version or inverted gray-coded version. Of the four versions, the version giving the least MSE is embedded on a row-by-row basis. This method reduces the MSE by a factor of 1.8 and boosts the peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) by a 0.25 db and considerably increases the security. © 2012 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

abstract={A rutin-iron complex was prepared at room temperature and characterized using elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy and UV-visible spectroscopy to elucidate its structure. The DNA binding properties of rutin and the rutin-iron complex have been investigated using electronic absorption spectroscopy and agarose gel electrophoresis. The gradual reduction in the absorption peak observed for both rutin and the rutin-iron complex with increasing concentration of DNA indicates an intercalative mode of interaction. The binding constant (K b) for the rutin-iron complex was three fold greater than that for rutin. Rutin exhibits a tendency to degrade the plasmid DNA unlike the rutin-iron complex because of its ability to introduce torsional stress in the DNA double helix. The additional electrostatic interaction between the cationic rutin-iron complex and the anionic DNA does not contribute to any torsional strain and hence no DNA shearing was observed. Molecular docking studies also confirmed the intercalative mode of interaction for both the compounds. These results indicate the potential of the rutin-iron complex as an anti-cancer agent. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={Interspecific hybridization occurs in every eukaryotic kingdom. While hybrid progeny are frequently at a selective disadvantage, in some instances their increased genome size and complexity may result in greater stress resistance than their ancestors, which can be adaptively advantageous at the edges of their ancestors' ranges. While this phenomenon has been repeatedly documented in the field, the response of hybrid populations to long-term selection has not often been explored in the lab. To fill this knowledge gap we crossed the two most distantly related members of the Saccharomyces sensu stricto group, S. cerevisiae and S. uvarum, and established a mixed population of homoploid and aneuploid hybrids to study how different types of selection impact hybrid genome structure. © 2012 Piotrowski et al. ; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={The present study was conducted to evaluate the cardioprotective role of a medicinal mushroom, Ganoderma lucidum against the toxicity of an anticancer drug adriamycin. Wistar rats were administered with adriamycin (1.5 mg kg -1 b.wt.) for three weeks to induce cardiotoxicity. Another group was treated with adriamycin and Ganoderma extract (250 mg kg -1) for 30 days. Adriamycin treatment resulted in increased serum levels of marker enzymes such as alanine amino transferase (ALT), aspartate amino transferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK). Besides increasing the lipid peroxidation (LPO), adriamycin significantly reduced antioxidant enzymes, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in the heart tissue. Level of reduced glutathione (GSH) was also significantly reduced. However, in G. lucidum extract treated rats the alterations were not significant, but found to be nearer to the control. The study shows that G. lucidum extract exhibits significant antioxidant property and protect the heart from free radical mediated toxicity of adriamycin. © 2012 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

abstract={Steganography has become a predominantly employed information security technique in this modern era. Although the software methods which work on spatial as well as transform domain steganography offer a lot of data hiding options, the steganographic system on hardware platform shows enormous potential by means of multiple advantages such as high speed embedding, specific hardware dependency etc.,. In this paper we have proposed image steganographic architecture which employs data embedding technique in square sized cover image blocks that are stored in internal/external memory of a processor and reconfigurable hardware. The traversal path for information hiding in cover image uses an equisum arrangement of the quad block locations which is used as a Look up Table in our approach. The K-bit message will be hidden in row by row and column by column according to the order suggested by the quad block. The proposed approach is implemented in Cyclone II EP2C20F484C7 FPGA as well as ARM7RISC Processor. The timing analysis, hardware consumption and error metrics after implementation in both platforms have been estimated.},

abstract={Advent of wireless communication technologies, systems providing high data rates have been the watchword for researchers around the globe. In their endeavor, they found their leitmotivs being answered by a cutting edge wireless technique, Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM). OFDM the magic mantra is an attractive and proven next generation wireless and radio communications to provide data rates up to 54Mbps in 5 GHz band and supporting both existing technologies like Wi-Fi, WiMAX and next generation technologies like 3G LTE and UMB. It is imperative that this widely acclaimed technology is fortified with an equally flawless security system. The following work focuses on the aforesaid, by modulating the signal through QAM, a highly bandwidth efficient modulation technique and subsequently embedding the payload on the modulated signal during the process of signal mapping. The proposed QAM-OFDM with information hiding also evaluates the system's performance via BER for different embedding levels i.e., 8, 16 & 64-bit QAM, transmitted under AWGN and random channel conditions. The results charted show encouraging patterns.},

abstract={With the growing internet technology, science and requirement of concealing defense research work, there is a need for highly secured information exchange, which is the essence of steganography. Classic secret information could be undermined or even faked thereby, creating a menace to the core of secrecy. Steganography camouflages the hidden information into an unsuspicious digital file i.e. image, video or audio, thereby covering the existence of it. Using modified LSB substitution and readjustment procedure the mean square error has been reduced. Pixel indicator is used for increasing the embedding capacity of secret data. The security of secret data embedded into a cover file can be increased using random walk inside the file. In this paper we have used knight's tour for random walk, by not affecting the image quality. For high security while embedding, we randomize the three planes of RGB cover image using row vector, divide the image into four pixel blocks and then use Pixel value differencing (PVD) to embed data adaptively followed by knight's tour to select next block for embedding. This method gives highly secured and high capacity steganography.},

This paper considers the problem of huge test pattern in scan based design. This proposed algorithm is based on reducing test pattern on scan shift in operation. This is achieved by identifying test data transition and equally segmenting the scan based test patterns. Each scan test pattern is considered by its transition and segmented into equal necessary blocks. This finally gives the compressed test patterns in reduced test patterns. Theoretical analysis and experimental results on ISCAS89 shows that the proposed method reduces test pattern by 37% when compared to the traditional approaches.},

To mitigate the NLOS effects, an unconstrained nonlinear optimization approach is utilized to process Time-of -arrival (TOA) and Received Signal Strength (RSS) in the location system.TOA range measurements and path loss model are used to discriminate LOS and NLOS conditions. The weighting factors assigned by hypothesis testing, is used for solving the objective function in the proposed approach. This approach is used for describing the credibility of the TOA range measurement. Performance of the proposed technique is done based on MATLAB simulation. The result shows that the proposed technique performs well and achieves improved positioning under severe NLOS conditions.},

abstract={The total heterophic bacteria, Actinomyces and fungus were enumerated from the rhizosphere and nonrhizosphere soils of four selected locally available medicinal plants in and around Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu, India. In all the plants population of micro organism was higher in number followed by fungus and streptomycetes of the medicinal plants.The maximum rhizosphere effect (507 cfu / ml) of gram negative bacteria was observed in Solanum nigrum and the minimum (95cfu/ml) of gram negative bacteria effect was seen in Leucas aspera. The isolates of bacteria were also able to produce phyto hormone i.e., indole 3- acetic acid (IAA).The bacterial colonies were characterized and observed the dominance of gram positive. The microbial diversity, antimicrobial activity and microbial load of medicinal plants were noted and were recorded accordingly. Rf values of paper chromatography was calculated and compared with arginine and cystenine. Micromonospora species was visualized using SEM for its morphology. The color characterization of selected Micromonospora species exhibited the differential aerial and substrate mycelial colourations such as white, red, green, yellow, pink, etc. it is quite unique and diversified. Further, the antagonistic property and growth hormone(IAA) production in Streptomyces species., were observed. From the above observations it is understood that there is a specificity of microbes towards the differentiate medicinal plants, because of their exchange of metabolites.},

abstract={Multiwalled carbon nanotube-modified polyacrylamide gels have been employed for the electrophoretic separation of proteins. Two approaches are compared in this investigation, one using nanotubes only as fillers inside the gel matrix and the other using nanotubes as catalyst for polymerization of acrylamide. In both the cases, polymerization of acryl-amide/bisacrylamide has been carried out in situ in the presence of nanotubes dispersed in the gel buffer containing monomer and cross-linker. In the former case, initiator and catalyst have been added after ultrasonication of nanotubes in the gel buffer mixture where the nanotubes play the role of filler. On the other hand, the second approach precludes use of catalyst and involves addition of initiator alone during ultrasonication of nanotubes in the gel buffer containing monomer and cross-linker, which leads to the formation of nanotube-grafted gel after 25 min. When nanotubes are used as a catalyst instead of N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine, pore size distribution of the gel matrix and linearity of molecular weight calibration plots are found to be improved. In addition, other issues associated with the use of an external catalyst like handling the moisture-sensitive and corrosive reagent and associated irreproducibility are addressed in this approach. © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The properties of Legendre wavelets together with the Gaussian integration method are used to reduce the problem to the solution of nonlinear algebraic equations. Also a reliable approach for convergence of the Legendre wavelet method when applied to a class of nonlinear Volterra equations is discussed and an error estimation for the proposed method is also introduced. Illustrative examples have been discussed to demonstrate the validity and applicability of the technique and the results have been compared with the exact solution.

abstract={Okra polysaccharide as a microbially triggered material and also as the carrier to colon was previously developed and reported. The release profiles of the reported method revealed that okra mucilage, when used as a matrix tablet, does not protect the drug from being released in the upper parts of the gastro intestinal tract. In the present work the tablets were prepared with okra mucilage and coated with enteric materials to retard the drug release in the upper GI tract. Okra polysaccharide was isolated from Abelmoschus esculentus and used for tablet formulation with ibuprofen as model drug. The matrix tablets of okra polysaccharide were prepared by wet granulation method using ibuprofen as a model drug. These prepared matrix tablets were coated with enteric materials by pan coating technique. The in vitro release profile was performed with and without rat cecal content, revealed that the enteric coated formulations completely protected the drug from being released in the upper parts of the gastro intestinal tract. Among the enteric coated tablets, the 3% double layer coated tablets exhibited zero in vitro release profiles at 2nd and 5th hours. Hence, this tablet was subjected for further pharmacokinetic estimations and was compared with control tablet. At 5.5 h the ibuprofen appeared first in the blood; this showed the tablet was intact throughout the upper GI. The Tmax and AUC estimates showed that the drug was released from the tablet to colon by bacterial degradation of mucilage.},

abstract={The use of Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) is growing day by day in the recent time to eliminate the corrosion problem of steel and its higher strength to weight ratio. Though the cost of FRP rebars are around 30% more than steel, which is offset by comparing its life cycle cost reduction due to the ability of resistance of FRP rebar against corrosion. The fibers which are typically used as reinforcement are aramid, glass or carbon. Use of FRP rebar gained momentum and has number of advantages over conventional steel reinforcement. Hence, an attempt has been made in the present research work, to focus on the effect of high performance concrete beam reinforced with glass fiber reinforce polymer (GFRP) rebar. In the present work, two beams of size 125 × 200 × 2100 mm were considered. The grade of concrete used for the present work is M 40. One beam is reinforced with GFRP rebar and the other is with steel rebar. Two point loading test was carried out and the failure characteristics were studied. The plots showing load- deflection curves at different sections of the beams were also developed. Thus the study provides a clear comparison of the performance of flexural member reinforced with GFRP rebar and steel rebar.},

abstract={Face milling is a widely used machining operation to produce various components. The finished component depends not only on the dimensional accuracy but also on the surface finish. The present method of selection of machining parameters by trial and error, previous work experience of the process planner and machining hand books are time consuming and very tedious. There is a need to develop a technique that could able to find the optimal machining parameters for the required surface roughness in machining. In this work, experimental investigations are carried out on aluminium material to study the effect of machining parameters such as cutting speed, feed, and depth of cut on the surface roughness and to obtain the desired surface roughness on face milling process. Mathematical model has been developed for surface roughness prediction using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) on the basis of experimental results. The model developed for optimization has been validated by confirmation experiments. Physical constraints for both experiment and theoretical approach are the proposed machining parameters and surface roughness. It has been found that the predicted roughness using PSO is in good agreement with the actual roughness. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Bacopa monnieri (L.), popularly known as Brahmi, is a revered Ayurvedic medicinal plant used as nerve tonic since time immemorial. The present study aims to investigate the neuroprotective effect of bacosides, the active saponins of Bacopa monnieri (L.) against age associated neurodegeneration and its impact over the prevention of Senile Dementia of Alzheimer's Type (SDAT). The optimum dose of bacosides with no adverse effect was selected by screening its dose dependant activity on ageing biomarker lipofuscin and SDAT biomarker neurotransmitter acetylcholine in the aged female Wistar rat brain. The selected therapeutic dose of bacosides (200 mg/kg) was orally administered for 3 months in middle aged and aged rats and further investigated for its protective action against age associated alterations in neurotransmission system, behavioral paradigms, hippocampal neuronal loss and oxidative stress markers. The results of the present study suggest that bacosides may act as a potential therapeutic intervention in forestalling the deleterious effects of ageing and preventing the age associated pathologies like SDAT. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.},

abstract={OBJECTIVE: To evaluate antitumor activity of Gracilaria edulis in Swiss albino mice with Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC). METHODS: Tumors were induced in mice by intraperitoneal injection of EAC cells. Ethanol extract of Gracilaria edulis (EEGE) was administered to the experimental animals in different doses after 24 h of tumor inoculation. The antitumor effect of the EEGE was evaluated by assessing in vitro cytotoxicity, survival time, biochemical parameters and hepatic enzyme levels. RESULTS: EEGE increased the life span of EAC-bearing mice compared with that of the model control mice (P<0.05 or P<0.01). EEGE treatment also converted the changes of biochemical parameters and hepatic enzyme levels in the EAC-bearing mice (P<0.05 or P<0.01). EEGE induced inhibition of tumor formation in EAC-bearing mice compared with that of the model control group (P<0.05 or P<0.01). CONCLUSION: The present study scientifically proved the antitumor activity of marine algae G. edulis and the effect can be correlated with doses.},

abstract={Bacopa monnieri (L.) is a revered medicinal plant of traditional Indian system of medicine effective against cognitive impairment in ageing and SDAT. In our previous study, long term administration of bacosides was found to exhibit remarkable anti ageing effect, ameliorate age associated neurochemical and neurobehavioral deficits and prevent hippocampal neuronal degeneration in middle aged and aged rat brain cortex. In continuation to the previous study, the present study aims to investigate the neuroprotective effect of bacosides against age related chronic neuroinflammation in Wistar rat brain on 3 months treatment. Recently, neuroinflammation has gained considerable interest in age associated neurodegeneration and pathologies like SDAT due to its slow onset and chronic nature. The results of the present study demonstrated the significant attenuation of age dependant elevation of pro inflammatory cytokines, iNOS protein expression, total nitrite and lipofuscin content in middle aged and aged rat brain cortex on long term oral administration of bacosides. Thus, the present results suggest that bacosides possess immense potential to act as a neuroprotective agent due to its pleiotropic action for the prevention of ageing complications and SDAT progression. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.},

abstract={Coastal zone is a very multi-faceted, energetic and fragile environment because of the influence of both terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Majority of the world's coastlines are experiencing a wide range of anthropogenic and natural pressures. Anthropogenic threats are the consequence of rapid urbanization, population growth, tourism activities, harbor development, industrialization, over-exploitation of natural resources, waste accumulation and environmental pollution. On the other hand, natural pressures are mainly from sea-level fluctuations and climatic anomalies. This paper mainly focuses on coastal erosion hazard assessment estimated along the coastal precinct between Kanyakumari and Mandapam, southern Tamilnadu coast over a length of about 360 km. Risk assessment was carried out based on the type of coastal erosion indicators found along the shoreline and general spatial distribution of coastal erosion indicators along the investigated area. Results reveal that the study area is under the treat of coastal erosion with high-risk category. © 2012 CAFET-INNOVA TECHNICAL SOCIETY. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Lithium ion capacitors (LICs) were assembled using pre-lithiated graphite anode and activated carbon (AC) cathode. The cells were tested for their rate capability at 1 C and 10 C for 100 and 600 cycles, respectively at two different cut-off voltages. The cell delivered a discharge energy density of 55 Wh kg -1 (active materials basis) over the potential range of 3.1-4.1 V and 100 Wh kg -1 in the extended cut-off potential of 2.0-4.1 V. The maximum energy density obtained with LIC is about 8 times higher than the energy density obtainable with conventional EDLCs that operates in a voltage window of 0.0-2.5 V. The capacity fade of LIC with cycling is directly correlated with the reduced utilisation of the positive AC material during the charge storage process, which in turn, is caused by the instability of the pre-lithiated graphite negative electrode. The instability of the pre-lithiated graphite electrode resulted in the self-discharge of pre-doped Li, which is believed to be the result of a poorly formed solid electrolyte interface (SEI) on graphite surface. Li pre-doping methodology is shown to play a crucial role and contributes to the stability of the negative electrode and consequently the cell cycling stability.},

abstract={A new modulation/multiplexing system using wavelet transform was proposed for (Third generation partnership project) 3GPP networks. This new modulation technique makes use of the existing standard (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) OFDM system and replacing the Fourier transform blocks by wavelet transform blocks. There are wide varieties of wavelet transforms are available, out of which four were chosen. They are Haar, Daubechies 4, Biorthogonal and reverse Biorthogonal transforms. The performance of the wavelet based OFDM system using various modulations like BPSK, DPSK, QPSK, DQPSK, OQPSK and 16-QAM was assessed by various parameters such as bit error rate, eye diagram and constellation diagram. The haar wavelet along with BPSK modulation is concluded as the best one. The BER results of all transforms and its eyeheights for SNR of 18db are as shown. The proposed system is named as (orthogonal haar wavelet division multiplexing) OHWDM which can be implemented for 3GPP based future cellular networks. © 2012 IEEE.},

In this paper, a novel information hiding method has been proposed for CDMA and MCCDMA in signal mapper block. In this paper different modulation scheme like BPSK, QPSK and 8-QAM are employed to study the performance of the proposed embedding method. It is found that introducing additional information in the signal mapper block is not affecting the performance of the regular transmission and also if the Signal to Noise Ration (SNR) is good enough then additional information would reveal itself in extraction on the receiver. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={The basic idea of compression is to try to reduce the average number of bits per pixel to adequately represent the image. Image compression is urgently needed for very large medical or satellite images, both for reducing the storage requirements and for improving transmission efficiency. Fourier-based transforms (e.g. DCT and DFT) are efficient in exploiting the low frequency nature of an image. The high frequency coefficients are coarsely quantized, and hence the reconstructed quality of the image at the edges will have poor quality. On the other hand, wavelets are efficient in representing nonstationary signals because of the adaptive time-frequency window. So the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is applied to an image and the energy compaction performance of both Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and DWT is compared. It is observed that both transforms provide comparable energy compaction performance. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={In Image processing and computer vision, analyzing and compressing the human motion capture data is a compelling challenge that is a trial with many researchers. For addressing this challenge, the variational level set method is used for segmenting the human motion from experimental motion capture data. First, the Mocap (Motion Capture) data is separated into aligned motion sequences. After that, Gabor filter is applied for the feature extraction prior to dimensionality reduction using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method. Then the boundary of the motion data is tracked by minimizing energy functional using the level set method. The results of the segmentation are found to be good and accurate. To verify the effectiveness of this method, Gabor filter is compared with Gaussian filter and the result depicted that Gabor filter greatly reduces the processing time. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={In a world where every single aspect is driven by technology and where the importance and Need of communication in every form is at its zenith, there expectedly arises an exigent need for faster and more efficient techniques of communication to effectively back the myriad utilizations of technology. With burgeoning demand for wireless connectivity, the stress put on an already scarce resource (namely spectrum) is reaching a breaking point. Hence, it has become pivotal to find ways for the efficient and equitable utilization of spectrum. Multiband Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (MBOFDM) is a technique that is primarily under consideration to tackle the problem of effective utilization of spectrum. One of the most popular systems in usage, the Ultra Wideband (UWB) systems, has a serious flaw. It poses a threat to other wireless connectors such as Wi-Fi, WiMax etc. As such interferences go against the scheme of equitable use; complicated interference cancellation schemes become necessary for the isolation of such networks. Traditionally, error control codes were used to make such troublesome or noisy channels available for reliable communication. But the other method that has recognizably more potential for solving the problem of spectrum congestion is Cognitive Radio. This paper mainly focuses on the MB-OFDM systems with the following enhancements: 1) Concatenation of convolutional code with Reed Solomon code and to analyze the performance of MBOFDM systems under various modulation schemes 2) Active interference cancellation between primary and secondary users using AIC tones and 3) Spectrum sensing using energy detection method and to train a classifier to do the same using neural network in order to solve the problem of spectrum. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={With the advent of disappearing, dexterous and disposable devices in bigger volumes, industries across sun-shining segments such as communication, home automation, healthcare, supply chain, logistics, defense, and manufacturing are bound to reach next-level of their operations, outputs and offerings. These simple, yet powerful devices, on proper utilization in the field of healthcare can save valuable lives. The devices are quick, accurate; reduce manual-labor and are error free. In this paper, the main concentration is on developing a Smart Ambulance system by using OSGi as the middleware, using an open-source tool called Knopflerfish. By using a set of sensors, and other applications that, in the background, do most of the lifesaving work in an ambulance, ranging from directing the driver through the path with the least traffic in a short span of time, taking into account the severity of the condition of the patient. Implementation is done by developing services, applications and devices capable of running these to the concerned user groups. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Vector control schemes are increasingly used in induction motor drive systems to obtain high performance. Vector Control transforms the control of an induction motor to that of a separately excited dc motor by creating independent channels for flux and torque control. The successful implementation of the vector control scheme requires the knowledge of the instantaneous position of rotor flux which is measured in the direct vector control scheme and estimated in the indirect vector control scheme. This requires a prior knowledge of the machine parameters which makes the indirect vector control scheme machine parameter dependent especially the rotor resistance. MRAS based rotor resistance estimation is simpler and easy to design. In this Paper, the vector controlled drive with rotor flux based MRAS rotor resistance estimator is designed and validated through MATLAB/SIMULINK. The performance of the vector controlled drive is analyzed extensively and the performance of the estimator is also analyzed in terms of accuracy and settling time. The promising results obtained are presented. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={To recognize and classify any connected region-of-interest (ROI) in a digital image, the shape descriptor of the ROI has to be defined in terms of its boundary characteristics. However, for certain types of regions, it is very difficult to exactly trace the contour and none of the existing techniques satisfactorily work. In this paper, yConvex hypergraph model (yCHG) of digital image is introduced. It is a generalization of yConvex region decomposition [1] and represents any connected region as a finite set of disjoint yConvex hyperedges (yCHE). Each yCHE is a yConvex region, whose contour can be tracked in a deterministic way. Based on this hypergraph model (yCHG), an algorithm is presented for contour-based shape representation. Representations of contours of individual yCHEs are obtained independently and combined to provide a representation for the whole shape. This representation is rotation and scale invariant. The proposed algorithm works correctly on any connected region including those that can not be satisfactorily handled by any of the existing techniques. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={The production of novel fertilizers from natural sources has gained importance for the past few years since the continuous use of chemical fertilizers has led to soil pollution, acidification of ground water, destruction of microflora of the soil and in the adverse, has led to emission of methane from uncontrolled dumping activities which inevitably contributes to the green house gases accumulation that can alter global climatic conditions; hence, there is an immediate need to reduce the usage of chemical fertilizers. The present study focuses on the production of Instant Organic Fertilizer (IOF) and its effect over the plant growth (Spinach). A comparative study was performed to analyze the effect of IOF, chemical fertilizer (urea), compost and untreated on the growth of Spinach. The IOF treated spinach showed protein content (73.86 mg mL -1), chlorophyll (32.44 ug mL -1), total phenol (49.84±0.041 mg g -1), 65.56±0.023% (H 20 2 scavenging activity) and of 65.92±0.22% (DPPH scavenging activity). The present study exposed the efficiency of the economic, eco-friendly and novel IOF in raising high productive and nutritive vegetable crops. © Asian Network For Scientific Information.},

abstract={Since the introduction of public-key cryptography by Diffe and Hellman in 1976, the potential for the use of the discrete logarithm problem in public-key cryptosystems has been recognized. Although the discrete logarithm problem as first employed by Diffe and Hellman was defined explicitly as the problem of finding logarithms with respect to a generator in the multiplicative group of the integers module a prime, this idea can be extended to arbitrary groups and in particular, to elliptic curve groups. The resulting public-key systems provide relatively small block size, high speed, and high security. In this paper, a vector space secrets sharing scheme is proposed in detail. Its security is based on the security of ECC. This scheme has the following characteristic: the precondition of (t,n)- threshold secret sharing scheme that all assignees purview must be same is generalized. A verifiable infrastructure is provided, which can be used to detect the cheaters from the dealers and assignees. The shared key distributed by dealer is encrypted based on ECC, which enhances the security. So this scheme is of less computation cost which is valuable in applications with limited memory, communications bandwidth or computing power. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Background: HSV-1 genome is a mosaic of recombinants. Clinical Herpes simplex virus -1 (HSV1) isolates were already genotyped as A, B and C types based on nucleotide variations at Unique Short (US) 4 (gG) and US 7 (gI) regions through phylogeny. Analysis of Glycoprotein C (gC) exon present on the Unique Long (UL) region had also revealed the existence of different genotypes. Glycoprotein C is mainly involved in initial viral attachment to heparan sulphate on host cell surface facilitating the virus's binding and penetration into cell. As the amount of heparan sulphate on the host cell surface varies according to the cell type, it is plausible that different genotypes bind differentially to cell types. Hence, this study was framed to determine the existence of novel genotypes/sub genotypes in the US or UL regions which could associate with clinical entities. Results: All the twenty five isolates analyzed in this study were of genotype A as per their gG gene sequences. In case of gI gene, 16 out of 25 were found to be type A and the remaining nine were type B putative intergenic recombinants. Intragenic recombinations were also encountered in both the US genes, with gG possessing novel subgenotypes, arbitrarily designated A1 and A2. The 9 type B isolates of gI genes also branched out into 2 clades due to genetic variations. Glycoprotein C of UL region had two distinct genotypic clades and , whose topological distribution was significantly different from that of the US region. Neither the US nor UL regions, however, showed any preference among the genotypes to a specific anatomic site of infection. Even the non synonymous variations identified in the functional domain of gC, were not confined to a particular genotype/clinical entity. Conclusion: The analyses of the US and UL regions of the HSV-1 genome showed the existence of variegated genotypes in these two regions. In contrary to the documented literature, in which Asian strains were concluded as more conserved than European ones, our study showed the existence of a higher degree of variability among Indian strains. However, the identified novel genotypes and subgenotypes were not found associated with clinical entities. © 2012 Harishankar et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

The free energy change (ΔG) of unfolding reactions of proteins is measured by traditional denaturation methods and native hydrogen-deuterium (H/D) exchange methods. However, the free energy of unfolding (ΔG U) and the free energy of exchange (ΔG HX) of proteins are not in good agreement, though the experimental conditions of both methods are well matching to each other. The anomaly is due to any one or combinations of the following reasons: (i) effects of cis-trans proline isomerisation under equilibrium unfolding reactions of proteins (ii) inappropriateness in accounting the baselines of melting curves (iii) presence of cryptic intermediates, which may elude the melting curve analysis and (iv) existence of higher energy metastable states in the H/D exchange reactions of proteins. Herein, we have developed a novel computational tool, OneG, which accounts the discrepancy between ΔG U and ΔG HX of proteins by systematically accounting all the four factors mentioned above. The program is fully automated and requires four inputs: three-dimensional structures of proteins, ΔG U, ΔG U * and residue-specific ΔG HX determined under EX2-exchange conditions in the absence of denaturants. The robustness of the program has been validated using experimental data available for proteins such as cytochrome c and apocytochrome b 562 and the data analyses revealed that cryptic intermediates of the proteins detected by the experimental methods and the cryptic intermediates predicted by the OneG for those proteins were in good agreement. Furthermore, using OneG, we have shown possible existence of cryptic intermediates and metastable states in the unfolding pathways of cardiotoxin III and cobrotoxin, respectively, which are homologous proteins. The unique application of the program to map the unfolding pathways of proteins under native conditions have been brought into fore and the program is publicly available at http://sblab.sastra.edu/oneg.html. © 2012 Richa, Sivaraman.},

abstract={Problem statement: The performance of ad hoc routing protocols will significantly degrade when there are faulty nodes in the network. Packet losses and bandwidth degradation are caused due to congestion and thus, time and energy is wasted during its recovery. The fault tolerant congestion aware routing protocol addresses these problems by exploring the network redundancy through multipath routing. Approach: In this study, it is proposed to design a fault tolerant congestion aware multi path routing protocol to reduce the route breakages and congestion losses. The AOMDV protocol is used as a base for the multipath routing. This proposed scheme enables more nodes to salvage a dropped packet. Results: Simulation results show that the proposed protocol achieves better throughput and packet delivery ratio with reduced delay, packet drop and energy. Conclusion: An effective congestion control technique proposed in this study proactively detects node level and link level congestion and performs congestion control using the fault-tolerant multiple paths. © 2012 Science Publications.},

This paper considers this problem in scan based test pattern. This proposed approach is based on the compression of huge test pattern by weighted bit position. Test patterns with unspecified bits are considered for specified values and partitioned into necessary weighted value. Depending upon weighted bit position specified test bit is compressed. This in turn reduces the test pattern for scan based testing. The proposed technique tested on ISCAS89 shows significant compression achieved on scan based test pattern. © 2006-2012 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).},

Earlier the placement cells used to collect and enter the data manually using excel format. This manual process was not only time consuming but also was less accurate as the manual data entry results in error of omissions and commissions. Further, the manual process consumed more time in preparing and sending the eligible students list to recruiters, who are in need of it urgently for decision making. To overcome this problem faced by the placement departments, author propose Parallel Criteria Matching (PCM) algorithm. Normally, a candidate's record contains his demographic details like name, age, date of birth, sex, address, academic achievements, details of arrears, co-curricular and extracurricular activities etc., The PCM algorithm is executed in parallel with distributed databases to match the given criteria and to narrow down the data screening process. The students list is selected based on the eligibility criteria prescribed by the recruiters using parallel database acquisition techniques. The said PCM technique used for this purpose is quite novel, immensely useful, user friendly and ensures maximum speed and accuracy to the end user. © 2012 EuroJournals Publishing, Inc.},

abstract={Reed Solomon code is one of the well-known Forward Error Correction (FEC) techniques. These codes are dealing with encoding and decoding of message sequence in terms of polynomials. This paper presents a parallel Reed Solomon decoder which reduces area efficiently, so thus less power consumption. One of the key factors to reduce the decoder area is by employing less number of gates in Key Equation Solver (KES) block, which are the critical block and occupies most of the decoder area in RS decoders. By merging the Folded-reformulated inversion less Berlekamp-Massey algorithm with the parallel decoding method, the total number of elements for proposed Reed-Solomon architecture gets reduced very much, when compared to other existing parallel decoding methods. In addition to that our method also provides a good balance between the speed and decoder area. The proposed design of (255,239) is modelled in vhdl and synthesized using 35μm technology.

Hence this technology is touted to dominate the future communication network. Cognitive Radio equips wireless users with the capability to optimally adapt their operating parameters according to the interactions with the surrounding radio environment and utilize the spectrum more efficiently in an opportunistic fashion without interfering with the primary users. As cognition becomes ubiquitous and integrated into everything from home appliances to automobiles, the excitement will morph from cognitive radio to the sentient spaces.

abstract={Web technology is changing all businesses into information-based activities. Recent years have seen the Indian Banking Industry moving towards a 'click and brick - strategy' that emphasized an on-line supplement to the conventional banking services. The internet has emerged as a recent medium of presentation of banks' information in India. Further, the banks in India have started using their websites to provide a host of value added operations besides merely giving information. Evaluating the performance of websites has been a constant concern of researchers. It is also found that lack of disclosure is the root cause of the financial crisis. In this backdrop, this paper attempts to determine the web site quality of banks operating in India by using Web Assessment Index (WAI) which was developed by Buenadicha et al (2001) and Miranda et al (2006).The categories of website quality include accessibility, speed, navigability, and content quality. However, this study followed different methods for measuring the factors in few of the category.It is found that all the banks in India have no adequate web quality in the various categories of WAI. Further, there is a significant correlation between the website quality and the four categories. There is no significant difference among banks in India in their web quality. There is a significant difference among the various categories of web quality determinants. In the recent financial bubble, investors preferred ignorance to credible and understandable information. Thus, it is suggested that the Banks operating in India have to improve the web quality in terms of accessibility, speed, navigability and content to make their websites more accessible and reliable for the users than ever before. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2012.},

A phytochemical screening was done to determine the major constituents of the chloroform, ethyl acetate and ethanolic fractions of ethanolic leaf extracts. The excision and incision models were used to assess the effect of the plant extracts on wound healing in rats. Phytochemical screening reveals the presence of tannins, saponins, steroids, terpenoids, and flavonoids in the extract. The wound healing effect was comparatively evaluated with a standard drug Framycetin cream. Significant wound healing activity was observed for the creams prepared with 5% ethanol fraction of B. maderaspatensis and 5% chloroform fraction of A. baccifera ethanolic leaf extracts. The results of histopathological evaluation supported the outcome of both incision and excision wound models. Ethanolic fraction of B. maderaspatensis and chloroform fraction of A. baccifera exhibited marked wound healing activity. B. maderaspatensis extract displayed a remarkable wound healing activity compared to A. baccifera.},

abstract={An investigation has been carried out in the vicinity of the coastal villages of Kanyakumari District, India to decode the influence of coastal geomorphology on inundation degree and run-up level. Even though the tsunami waves approach the study area in different patterns, the consequences are found to be mainly dependent upon the coastal configuration and local geographic setting, the study area are considered to be of three types based upon the geomorphic arrangement, namely shallow coast, elevated coast and estuarine coast. The inundation and run-up level vary from coast to coast even though there is no remarkable variation in the intensity of the approaching tsunami surge. The inundation extent ranges from to 54 m to 413 m with maximum along estuarine coast and minimum along elevated coast. Estuarine coast recorded the maximum run-up level of about 6 m and the minimum of about 1 m along the elevated coast. The percentage of inundated area in the total coastal area varies between 19% to 10% along estuarine coast and elevated coast respectively. Inundation and run-up level cannot be appreciable in the inland along the elevated coast. The beaches of elevated coast are less affected whereas those of estuarine coast are highly affected. Inundation is limited in the elevated beaches along the study area. © 2012 Science Press, Ocean University of China and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Our previous study described the cardioprotective effects of ellagic acid in an isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction model. In this study, we are reporting the mechanism of protective action of ellagic acid with respect to apoptosis and mitochondrial respiratory enzymes. Ellagic acid (7.5 and 15 mg/kg) was administered orally as a pretreatment for 10 days. Then, isoproterenol (100 mg/kg) was injected subcutaneously to rats at an interval of 24 h for 2 days. Myocardial infarction was quantified by planimetry. Apoptosis was measured by apoptotic gene expressions. The levels of mitochondrial respiratory enzymes were also measured. Isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarcted rats showed increased infarct size, a decrease in myocardial expression of the Bcl-2 gene and an increase in myocardial expression of the BAX gene. Fas ligand and caspases were markedly elevated along with compromised respiratory marker enzymes in isoproterenol-induced rats. Ellagic acid pretreatment reduced the infarct size, regulated apoptotic gene expressions and enhanced the activities of mitochondrial respiratory marker enzymes and cell viability, thereby protecting the myocardium against isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction. The decreased infarct size associated with inhibited apoptosis and increased respiratory marker enzymes provide insight on the role of ellagic acid in antiapoptotic mechanism, and it may be the reason for its cardioprotective activity. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.},

abstract={Half-cell structures of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with a thin and dense electrolyte layer of 8YSZ supported by a thick and porous NiO-8YSZ anode precursor structure were reduced in a gas mixture of 5% H 2-95% Ar at 800 °C for selected time periods in order to fabricate cermets with desired microstructure and composition, and to study their effects on the elastic properties at ambient and reactive atmospheres. It appears that 2 h of exposure to the reducing conditions is enough to reduce ∼80% of NiO with an enhanced porosity value of 35%. The Ni-8YSZ cermet phase formation in the anode was analyzed with X-ray diffraction (XRD) in correlation with its microstructure. The elastic properties were determined after the reduction, at room and elevated temperatures using the impulse excitation technique. At room temperature the decrease in the Young's modulus was about 44% (after 8 h of reduction) and can be attributed mainly to the changes in the microstructure, particularly the increase in porosity from ∼12% to 37%. Young's moduli of the as-received precursor and reduced anodes were evaluated as a function of temperature in air and reducing atmosphere. The results were explained in correlation to the initial porosity, composition and oxidation of Ni at the elevated temperatures. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Information science involves not only the efforts made for gathering, acquiring or collecting the data that corresponds to the information but also contains the ways to save it, protect it and preserve it. The meaning of the proverb however stresses upon how to protect and secure information, as a small leakage will pave way for entire loss of information which should be protected. True, there have been various methods, approaches and algorithms proposed in the past and will emerge in future too in the areas of secure information transmission. Cryptography and steganography have been primary sources for information security. The bird's eye view on the literature pertaining to the above mentioned two giants of information security spots a number of algorithms developed on both software as well as hardware platforms. This study does the survey from the literature on different cryptographic and image steganographic methods implemented on a reconfigurable hardware like FPGAs in the past. The analysis of various methods proposed earlier is also an important objective of this study. © 2012 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

abstract={Cyclophosphamide (CP) is one among the important therapeutic chemotherapy drug used worldwide. Damage to normal tissues due to toxic metabolites limits the usage of CP efficiently for treating various cancers. In the present study, hepatoprotective effect of Momordica charantia Linn. (Cucurbitaceae) against CP induced hepatotoxicity in rats was evaluated. Hepatocellular damage in rats was induced by injecting CP i.p. (total of 200 mg kg -1, b.wt.) for 2 days. Momordica charantia fruit aqueous extract (MCE) (300 mg kg -1 b.wt.) was administered orally for 12 days for treatment. Protective effect of MCE was evaluated by assessing the liver marker enzymes such as AST, ALT, ALP, LDH and γ-GT in serum, AST and ALT in Hver tissues and biochemical parameters such as total protein, urea, creatinine, uric acid, total and direct bilirubin. Liver marker enzymes and clinical chemistry parameters were significantly altered in CP intoxication. These alterations were significantly normalized in animals administered with MCE. Protective effect of MCE could be due to radical-scavenging and antioxidant properties of the MCE. MCE could had been demonstrated these properties due to the presence of phytochemical components that include polyphenols, alkaloids, terpenoids, glycosides and tannins. Present findings supported that the treatment with MCE could be helpful against hepatocellular damage, owing to its hepatoprotective property. © 2012 Academic Journals Inc.},

In this study we characterized the EpCAM + retinoblastoma (RB) cells for their cancer stem-like properties in vitro. Additionally, we targeted RB tumor cells via redirecting T cells using bispecific EpCAM×CD3 antibody. Methods: Flow cytometry was used to study the co-expression of EpCAM with putative cancer stem cell markers, such as CD44, CD24, and ABCG2, in RB primary tumors. In vitro methyl thiazol tetrazolium (MTT) assay, invasion assay, and neurosphere formation assay were performed to characterize EpCAM + cells for their cancer stem/progenitor cell-like properties. We assessed the in vitro efficacy of bispecific EpCAM×CD3 antibody on RB tumor cell proliferation and validated the results by evaluating effector cytokine production in the culture medium with the ELISA method. Results: EpCAM was co-expressed with all cancer stem cell markers (CD44, CD24, and ABCG2) in primary RB tumors. EpCAM + cells showed significantly higher proliferative invasive potential and neurosphere formation in vitro compared to EpCAM - Y79 cells. EpCAM + cells showed higher β-catenin expression compared to EpCAM- cells. EpCAM×CD3 significantly retarded proliferation of RB primary tumor cells. EpCAM×CD3 effectively induced the secretion of effector cytokines, such as interferon (IFN)-γ, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-10, IL-2, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, and also perforin levels by pre-activated lymphocytes. Conclusions: EpCAM might be a novel cancer stem cell marker in RB. EpCAM×CD3 antibody redirecting T cells to attack RB tumor cells may prove effective in RB management. Further preclinical studies are needed to confirm the initial findings of our study. © 2012 Molecular Vision.},

abstract={2-(2-Hydroxy-phenyl)-4(3H)-quinazolinone (HPQ), an organic fluorescent material that exhibits fluorescence by the excited-state intramolecular proton-transfer (ESIPT) mechanism, forms two different polymorphs in tetrahydrofuran. The conformational twist between the phenyl and quinazolinone rings of HPQ leads to different molecular packing in the solid state, giving structures that show solid-state fluorescence at 497 and 511 nm. HPQ also shows intense fluorescence in dimethyl formamide (DMF) solution and selectively detects Zn 2+ and Cd 2+ ions at micromolar concentrations in DMF. Importantly, HPQ not only detects Zn 2+ and Cd 2+ ions selectively, but it also distinguishes between the metal ions with a fluorescence λ max that is blue-shifted from 497 to 420 and 426 nm for Zn 2+ and Cd 2+ ions, respectively. Hence, tunable solid-state fluorescence and selective metal-ion-sensor properties were demonstrated in a single organic material. Fluorescence chameleon: The title compound HPQ (see picture) displays fluorescence in the solid state and in solution. Recrystallization from THF yields polymorphs that show differently colored fluorescence (right). In DMF solution, the strong fluorescence of HPQ is selectively blue-shifted upon addition of Zn 2+ and Cd 2+ ions (left). © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA, Weinheim.},

abstract={Problem statement: In the recent years, Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) can be very useful for detection of breast cancer. Mammography can be used as an efficient tool for breast cancer diagnosis. A computer based diagnosis and classification system can reduce unnecessary biopsy. Approach: This study investigates a new approach to the classification of mammogram images based on pixel intensity mean features. The proposed method for the classification of normal and abnormal (cancerous) pattern is a two step process. The first step is feature extraction. The intensity based features are extracted from the digital mammograms. The second step is the classification process, differentiating between normal and abnormal pattern. Artificial neural networks are used to classify the data. Experimental evaluation is performed on the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM), benchmark database. Results and Conclusion: Experiments are performed to verify that the proposed pixel intensity mean features improve the accuracy of the classification. The proposed CAD system achieves better classification performance with the accuracy of 98%. © 2012 Science Publications.},

Earlier, due to the lack of personal touch, the service quality had not been appreciated by the customers. The bank faces challenges to meet the needs of the customers regularly through its unique delivery channels. Manual service for personal interaction between employees and customers is considered important for every service organisation. Competitive advantage is exhibited through "effectiveness of services ensured" by the banking organisation. Customer satisfaction is taken as a yardstick for measuring the quality of service and providing excellent customer service decides the effectiveness of service delivery process. To study the customer satisfaction towards quality of service, primary data has been collected from 473 customers of ICICI Bank by applying stratified random sampling method. The analysis has been made using factor analysis and the result showed that the customers accept that the bank's standard is nearing the industry standard. They opined that their loyalty towards the bank has increased and the bank also deserves it because of its level of commitment towards customers. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2012.},

abstract={Enterprise Data Mining applications, such as Mining Public Service data and Telecom Fraudulent activities, inevitably involve complex data sources, particularly multiple large scale, distributed, and heterogeneous data sources embedding information about business transactions, user preferences, and business impact. In these situations, business people certainly expect the discovered knowledge to present a full picture of business settings rather than one view based on a single source. To handle these said complex data forms, there are various methods such as joining multiple relational tables have been proposed, it is not possible, and to join relevant large data sources for mining patterns consisting of multiple aspects of information. So these techniques are having Time and Space complexity. To overcome these problems an efficient mechanism called Combined Mining, which makes use of Multi Feature Combined Mining which improves the accuracy of discovering informative knowledge from complex data sets. However, from our experimental results, we have observed that this Combined Mining Scheme is focussed to improve the prediction accuracy to extract and discover the knowledge from complex Data Sets. However, it fails to find the missing value or noise, which leads to compromise classification accuracy. To address this issue, an efficient Classifier called Hybrid Combined Mining Technique is proposed which is the combination of both the Missing Value Estimation Technique and Combined Mining Technique. From our experimental results, we have demonstrated that our proposed Hybrid Classifier achieves higher Classification Accuracy as compared with the existing Combined Mining Classifier. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2012.},

Test compression plays very important role in test data volume reduction mechanism which will reduce the test size without disturbing the system performance. Test data volume reduction in most cases is concerned with the scan based logic. A different approach of using complementary vector for test data volume reduction is proposed. Complementary vector can be found by complementing single or the whole bits. The complementary vector used implies that the tests applied will be twice, once in its original form and in complementary form. The use of complementary vector proves that when minimum numbers of bits or close to minimum numbers of bits are used the test data volume is reduced even further. The proposed complementary vector procedure is implemented on ISCAS'89 benchmark circuits to prove that the test data volume is reduced for better testing results. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2012.},

abstract={The present experimental research work focused on how a semicircular breakwater performs hydrodynamically under submerged conditions. In the field, a submerged semicircular breakwater may be preferred in front of the vertical breakwater to mitigate the wave forces and to minimize coastal erosion on its lee side. Various parameters affect the hydrodynamic performance of a semicircular breakwater such as the reflection and transmission characteristics, the dimensionless pressures, the horizontal forces and the vertical forces, and these are considered in the present study. Experiments were performed for three different perforations, namely 7%, 11% and 17%, of the exposed surface area with perforations on its sea side (sea-side perforated) and on both sides (fully perforated) owing to regular and random waves. The effect of the water depth was also studied in addition to the effect of perforation. All the hydrodynamic characteristics considered for the present study on the semicircular caisson are presented as functions of the relative water depth, and optimal conditions were determined. The results on the above-stated variables for sea-side-perforated semicircular breakwaters and fully perforated semicircular breakwaters are compared with the results of an impermeable semicircular breakwater. © Institution of Mechanical Engineers 2011.},

This study was designed to understand the mode of interactions of HMGCR isoform 2 with other statins. Hence, ligands such as Atorvastatin (DB01076), Lovastatin (DB00227), Fluvastatin (DB01095), Simvastatin (DB00641), Pravastatin (DB00175), Rosuvastatin (DB01098) and Cerivastatin (DB00439) were docked with enzymes HMGCR isoform 1 (pdb: 1DQ8) and modeled HMGCR isoform 2 (gi|196049380). Our homology modeling results were further processed to model the structure of human HMGCR isoform 2 and its accuracy was confirmed through RMS Z-scores (1.249). These interactions revealed that binding residues such as Arg515, Asp516, Tyr517 and Asn518 are found to be conserved in HMGCR isoform 2 with various statins. Our studies further concluded that Atorvastatin is most efficient inhibitor against both the isoforms of HMGCR whereas HMGCR isoform 2 shows less effectiveness with statins when compared with HMGCR isoform 1. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={An ultrasonic under-sodium scanner has been developed for deployment in Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR) which is in advanced stage of construction at Kalpakkam, India. Its purpose is to scan the above-core plenum for detection, if any, of displacement of sub-assemblies. During its burn-up in the reactor, the head of a Fuel Sub-Assembly (FSA) may undergo a lateral shift from its original position (called 'bowing') due to the fast neutron induced damage on its structural material. A simple scanning technique has been developed for measuring the extent of bowing in-situ. This paper describes a PC-controlled mock-up of the scanner used to implement the scanning technique and the results obtained of scanning a mock-up FSA head under water. The details of the liquid-sodium proof transducer developed for use in the PFBR scanner and its performance are also discussed. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Let G be a finite connected simple graph and μ(G) be the Mycielskian of G. We show that for connected graphs G and H, μ(G) is isomorphic to μ(H) if and only if G is isomorphic to H. Furthermore, we determine the energy of the Mycielskian of a connected regular graph G in terms of the energy ε(G) of G, where the energy of G is the sum of the absolute values of the eigenvalues of G. The energy of a graph has its origin in chemistry in that the energy of a conjugated hydrocarbon molecule computed using the Hückel theory in quantum chemistry coincides with the graph energy of the corresponding molecular graph. We show that if G is a regular graph of order n with ε(G) > 3n, then μ(G) is hyperenergetic.},

abstract={In this paper, we address the issue of finding the area of any connected region from its digital image. We have reviewed the existing techniques and brought out their shortcomings. In particular, we observe that none of the existing techniques can satisfactorily find the area of certain types of regions. To overcome such shortcomings, we propose an algorithm for decomposing any connected region R into one or more disjoint regions Y i. The decomposition is such that all the sub-regions satisfy a convexity property, referred to as y-convex property. y-Convex region is one in which no vertical line intersects the boundary curve more than twice. An interesting property of a y-convex region is that its contour can be split into an upper curve and a lower curve, and hence known numerical methods can be used to estimate its area. So, our decomposition algorithm enables us to find the area of R as the summation of the areas of all Y i. Since there are no bench mark images for validation, we have created a new database of images including the images used by previous works. Experimental results show that our method has an average accuracy of 99.01% and the paired t-test confirms that the difference between the actual and estimated area is considered to be not quite statistically significant with t and two-tailed p values of 1.68 and 0.0953, respectively. The proposed approach can be potentially used in applications such as geographical survey, morphological analysis of micro-organisms, medical image analysis, crime scene documentation, agriculture, and food industry. © 2011 Elsevier GmbH All rights reserved.},

abstract={During Silver Jubilee Indian Scientific Expedition to Antarctica (2005-2006) a pilot project was launched for continuous bathymetric profiling survey in Priyadarshini water body, using geophysical equipment 'HydroBox'. A total of 1800 line meter area was surveyed and continuous profiles of depth data in digital and analogue forms were recorded. The bathymetric data of the lake is analyzed and the bathymetric map of the surveyed area is prepared. The analysis of the bathymetric map of the water body revealed an undulating floor with the maximum water depth of 5.9 m in the northeastern part of the surveyed area of the lake. The shoreline of the lake was also demarcated by fixing 104 closely spaced Global Positioning System (GPS) points all around the shore and boundary map of the water body was prepared. The results of the bathymetric survey by 'Hydrobox' echosounder and Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) have been compared, which reveals an overall compatibility. The bathymetric data collected in the present study once integrated with the sub-bottom profiler data will provide detailed information of the sub surface features of this water body and will aid in identifying suitable locations to retrieve long sediment cores for paleoclimatic study. © 2012 Cafet-Innova Technical Society.

abstract={We describe a functional profiling strategy to identify and characterize subtypes of neurons present in a peripheral ganglion, which should be extendable to neurons in the CNS. In this study, dissociated dorsal-root ganglion neurons from mice were exposed to various pharmacological agents (challenge compounds), while at the same time the individual responses of >100 neurons were simultaneously monitored by calcium imaging. Each challenge compound elicited responses in only a subset of dorsal-root ganglion neurons. Two general types of challenge compounds were used: agonists of receptors (ionotropic and metabotropic) that alter cytoplasmic calcium concentration (receptor-agonist challenges) and compounds that affect voltage-gated ion channels (membrane-potential challenges). Notably, among the latter are K-channel antagonists, which elicited unexpectedly diverse types of calcium responses in different cells (i.e., phenotypes). We used various challenge compounds to identify several putative neuronal subtypes on the basis of their shared and/or divergent functional, phenotypic profiles. Our results indicate that multiple receptor-agonist and membrane-potential challenges may be applied to a neuronal population to identify, characterize, and discriminate among neuronal subtypes. This experimental approach can uncover constellations of plasma membrane macromolecules that are functionally coupled to confer a specific phenotypic profile on each neuronal subtype. This experimental platform has the potential to bridge a gap between systems and molecular neuroscience with a cellular-focused neuropharmacology, ultimately leading to the identification and functional characterization of all neuronal subtypes at a given locus in the nervous system.},

abstract={Matrix Converters are becoming popular in industrial applications due its better performance than the conventional VSI converters. The advantages of Matrix Converters are bidirectional current flow, adjustable displacement angle and sinusoidal input current and output voltage. Two control schemes used to control the speed of Induction motor. They are Field Oriented Control and Direct Torque Control systems. The Direct Torque Control system uses hysteresis controllers for flux and torque control because of which the ripples in the stator current and torque are more. Also the conventional Direct Torque Control system uses lookup table method to select the switching vectors which reduces the accuracy of the system. In the Field Oriented Control system the torque and flux components are separately controlled using PI controllers and then recombined to create the motor phase current. This gives better control than the conventional DTC system. The system uses Space Vector Modulation Circuit to choose the switching vectors for Matrix Converter. In this paper the Artificial Neural Network is introduced to replace the SVM in Field Oriented Control system. The complete Field Oriented Control system using ANN for in Matrix Converter Drive is simulated using MATLAB/SIMULINK. It is observed that in the ANN system the speed of the motor tracks the reference speed without any overshoot and speed control is achieved with zero steady state error. © IDOSI Publications, 2012.},

abstract={In the wake of cyber era, digital crime takes its shape in the schemes of modern warfare piercing existing security system without any collateral damage. The then existent cryptic army was either unable to stop the foes or had won a pyrrhic victory and thus evolved the war veteran, steganography that could withstand any destructive mechanism forced against it. Hence, in this study, three novel steganographic methods have been proposed to enhance the randomness of the mercurial data. All the three methods are implemented using the pixel indicator technology. Method one of the three uses the chosen pixel for guidance and as data channel for embedding. Method two takes a block of three pixels at a time where the first pixel acts as the steering channel while the remaining two become the data channel. Method three is further bifurcated; the first segment of this method involves the size definition within the first four pixels of the image and determination of that type of number i.e., even, prime or other. Depending on the type the channels red, blue or green are chosen as indicators, respectively. The second segment is where the sizeYvalue is checked for even parity and odd parity. Depending on its evenness or oddness the combination of data channel for embedding is arranged i.e., size is an even number with an odd parity red is the steering channel while the order of data channels are green and blue. The bifurcation and levels of selections increase the contingency of the embedment while retaining its reticence. Results confirm that the proposed methodology yield lesser error metrics while creating an efficacious channel to secure data transmission. © 2012 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

abstract={Exploration of coastal aquifer always leads to change in water table levels that provide room for ingression of sea water. Monitoring of sea water intrusion is essential to determine and predict groundwater deterioration and assess other managerial activities in coastal aquifers. Chemical analysis of groundwater sample is considered as one of the practical methods to assess the quality of groundwater in general and also to identify the sea water mixing with fresh water. Current rates of aquifer abstraction are unsustainable and deterioration of groundwater quality is documented in many parts of India. Utilisation of coastal aquifers as operation reservoirs in water supply management requires the development of tools that facilitate the prediction of aquifer behaviour, understanding of the patterns of movement and mixing between fresh water and salt water. Further, the factors that influence these processes are imperative to manage the coastal groundwater resources. Adhirampattinam in Tamil Nadu, India, a coastal town which has been identified as one of the towns with groundwater quality deterioration in recent times, has been taken up for the present study. Water samples from this town and eight coastal villages along the town were collected for quality analysis over three seasons starting from year 2006 to 2008 for detailed hydro-chemical analysis. The parameters studied are pH, EC, TDS, salinity and other hardness elements, which are relevant to assess not only sea water intrusion but also the connected pollution. The analysis reveals that the area under the study viz. Adhirampattinam town is seriously affected by sea water intrusion and indicates a warning signal to other selected places in the area. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={There exists a trade-off between cost and redundancy in the design of water distribution networks, and some level of redundancy is not only expected but it is useful during critical periods. Further, it is important to consider the operation and repair costs while designing a network as there is a trade-off between the initial cost and the repair cost. In this research work, a new approach is introduced for sizing of water distribution pipes based on a performance measure and repair and replacement costs for the life period in addition to the initial cost. This study proposes a new performance measure based on power concept. The trade-off between performance and cost provides a guideline to decision makers for selecting a design from many alternatives. The optimisation model is solved using a differential evolution algorithm. The proposed model is applied to a benchmark network consisting of a reservoir, six demand nodes and eight links for two planning scenarios with 50- and 100-year design periods. This study shows the availability of good network configurations when repair and replacement costs are taken into account at the design stage. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Liquid helium is used as a cryogen for cooling the sample to a temperature of 4.2 Kelvin. To measure the level of the liquid helium in the experimental cryostat or Dewar, imported superconducting level sensors are presently being used but are relatively expensive. In view of this, experimental work related to design and development of the superconducting level sensor based on NbTi superconducting wire was undertaken. This work includes the fabrication, characterization and calibration of the superconducting level sensor. The characterization work involves the measurement of the resistance of the level sensor at different levels of liquid helium in the Dewar for different values of excitation current to determine the optimum excitation current with a view to establish a single valued relationship between the measured resistance and the liquid helium level. A program has been written by using LAB VIEW software to automate the characterization process. Based on the measurements, display system is being developed to display the level of liquid helium in the Dewar. © 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Test data compression is a major scenario in all system-on-a-chip (SOC) designs for reducing the volume of the test data. The volume of the test data directly affects the cost of SOC design. Many compression techniques have been proposed to achieve better compression. Although all the techniques proposed are applied only for those test data having larger number of unspecified bits (X's). it is not able to achieve better compression for those test data having larger number of specified values (O's and 1 's). In this paper a new compression technique is proposed to achieve higher compression for test data having larger number of specified values by reducing] the size of the control code. In this method the length of the control code is significantly reduced. The proposed technique is applied on ISCAS'89 benchmark circuits and its results are compared with existing method. © 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Wireless communication applications are increasing day-by-day. As a consequence efficient spectrum utilization becomes a key task. Cognitive radio is a booming technique for efficient spectrum utilization. Spectrum sensing is a key technology of cognitive radio and it is the first step in cognitive cycle to find out the spectrum availability. The three spectrum sensing methods are matched filter detection, energy detection and cyclostationary. Matched filter method should have the prior knowledge about the primary users signal and it will not be an optimal choice. But no prior information is needed for cyclostationary method and it can extract information about the primary signal waveform. But this method is complex to implement and it is under research. Energy detection is the most common spectrum sensing techniques because this method does not require any prior knowledge about the unknown signal .It is less complex and it takes less sensing time but at the same time it is susceptible to uncertainty in noise power and it cannot differentiate between primary user and secondary user signal. This paper focuses on all three methods and in order to improve the performance of energy detection under heavy noise scenario double threshold technique is also proposed. The presence of primary is determined by three criteria, i.e., probability of detection, probability of miss-detection and probability of false alarm. Simulation results prove that the double threshold method is better than the single threshold. © 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={In this electronic era, modern automobiles are designed with electronically controlled throttles with CAN (Controller Area Network) [1] Bus which limits the vehicle's speed and protects the vehicle engine in a single cost-effective system. Generally, CAN Bus link is used to monitor the engine diagnostic faults and alerts the driver for one or more failure modes via an audible alarm or an LED. Our idea is to include the driver's emotional state as an additional feature for the control of speed. Firstly, the driver's emotional state such as sadness, anger, fear, disgust is analyzed by using the speech processing technique. When any one of this state is predicted, then the system incrementally limits the vehicle speed and ultimately limps to home mode until the driver comes to normal state or the engine fault is rectified. This system is mainly intended for avoiding accidents and road safety. © 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Wavelet theory has emerged as a new mathematical tool and the important area of application of wavelets in communication: multiple accesses. Among the multiple access applications one of the most notable work is wavelet packet-based multiple access communication. The two new multiple access systems are Scale-Time-Code Division Multiple Access (STCDMA) and Scale-Code Division Multiple Access (SCDMA). In a STCDMA system, the channel is partitioned into different scales, and each scale into different time slots. This system uses Direct-Sequence (DS) Code-Division Multiple Access (CDMA) in each time slot to identify multiple users. These systems arc analysed over a synchronous Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) by using a conventional detector and a multiuser detector. Kasami sequences are optimal since the maximum cross correlation value achieves the Welch Lower Bound. The main purpose of using Kasami sequences is that, it decreases the multiple access interference. This paper deals with STCDMA over synchronous AWGN, Rayleigh channel and for different modulation schemes by using a multiuser detector. The main aim of multiuser detector is to mitigate the multiple access interference (MAI) and to improve the performance of STCDMA. © 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

The computer controls the stepper motor to locate the sample at the position corresponding to maximum sensitivity and uses a temperature controller to sweep the sample temperature at user desired heating rate by automatically- setting parameters to the values which are necessary for optimal temperature control. SQUID output, which is proportional to magnetization of the sample, is phase sensitively detected using a lock in amplifier referenced to the vibration frequency and the measured data is stored in the computer for subsequent analysis. Provision exists for an online display of the plot of magnetization as a function of temperature as the data is acquired. The automation of the SQUID VSM greatly reduces the time required for the magnetization measurement and eliminates the possibility of human errors. © 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Severe case of hypertensive retinopathy causes systematic aliments that may cause cardiovascular diseases, heart and renal failure, loss of vision and finally death. Thus the timely diagnosis and treatment of the disease is vital. Arteriovenous ratio is used to diagnose hypertensive retinopathy. In this paper we proposed an algorithm in which, the blood vessels are segmented out initially, from the pre processed retinal images. Gray level and moment based features are extracted to classify the detected pixels as belonging to the blood vessel class or not. Intensity variation and colour information is used to classify the vessel as arteries or veins. Vessel width estimation method is used to measure the arteriovenous ratio from which various stages of hypertensive retinopathy can be identified. Retinal images were obtained from the VICAVR database, along with images collected form Deepam eye hospital Chennai. From the images that were collected 25 were normal images and 76 images of hypertensive retinopathy. © 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

The control of liquid level in a conical tank is nonlinear due to the variation in the area of cross section of the tank system with its change in shape. The model of the process is identified using standard step response based system identification technique and it is approximated to be first order plus dead time (FOPDT) model. From the results it is observed that fuzzy controller shows much better integral absolute error (IAE) and integral squared error (ISE) performance criteria than the conventional controller. © 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Captured hand image needs better enhancement technique to detect the vein patterns, due to existence of indistinct state and unwanted noise in hand image which result in false detection of veins. The image preprocessing such as image enhancement techniques are necessary to improve the image for visual perception of humans and making further easy processing steps on the resultant images by machines. This paper explains various enhancement techniques such as image negative, gray level slicing, histogram equalization, contrast stretching, laplacian sharpening, unsharp masking, high boost filtering, and histogram equalization of high boost filter. These techniques are applied on the hand image using (OpenCV) open source computer vision library developed by Intel. A comparative study of all these enhancement techniques is carried out to find the best technique to enhance hand vein pattern. The result shows the histogram equalization of high boost filtering technique provides better enhancement of vein pattern. Image quality measures (IQMs) are are also evaluated. © 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

It involves the process of merging virtual components with the real world objects so that the user is unable to distinguish the change in the real world. The virtual component augmented is usually interactive in nature. This gives the user a feeling that the object is present in the view even though it is physically absent. Here we have explained about performing augmentation of the virtual object on the live camera feed. The Structure from Motion (SFM) technique is used for the purpose of estimation of the parameters of the objects, which describe the position and orientation of the virtual component that is overlaid on the real environment.

abstract={Feature Selection in Data Mining refers to an art of minimizing the number of inputs under evaluation. An artificial neural network is the simulation of a human brain which learns with experience. Efficiency of a model or a system in terms of cost, time and accuracy will greatly improve if proper features of a system are selected. This proposed method uses Artificial Neural Network for selecting the interesting or important features from the input layer of the network. A Multi Layer Perceptron Neural Network is used for selection of interesting features from a Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD) data base with 712 patients. Initially the number of attributes was 17 and after feature selection the number of attributes was reduced to 12. All combination of features are attempted as inputs of a Neural Network. When the input features is 12 the predicted accuracy during training is high as 89.4% and during testing is high as 82.2 %. Further removal of features lowers the accuracy and hence the interesting features selected for prediction is concluded to be as 12 for this IHD data set. © 2012 The Authors.},

abstract={OFDM is a multicarrier modulation technique which has many advantages like spectral efficiency, robust to multipath fading effect etc. But it is very sensitive to Synchronization Error which increases the error rate and degrades the system performance. The cause for this error is Carrier Frequency Offset (CFO) and Sampling Clock Offset (SCO) which reduces the orthogonality and leads to Inter-Symbol Interference and Inter-Carrier Interference. For increasing the performance of the OFDM system Inter-Symbol Pilot aided synchronization method is introduced in this paper, this method is used to estimate both these offset. These estimated offsets are compensated using interpolation and Inverse Carrier Frequency Techniques. © 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Robust and fast deformable image matching can be done by TM-AAM by combining texture and shape models. Image matching can be done by measuring the residuals and use the model for current parameter changes prediction to yield a better fit.

abstract={Telecommunications service providers and network operators are moving to the recently adopted global third generation (3G) wireless standards in order to meet the emerging user demands and to provide new services. These systems need to support voice communications and also high-speed data and multimedia services. In addition, they need to allow subscribers to access several services at once, anytime and anywhere. Two such technologies that can respond to the needs discussed above are Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) and Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM). Another technology that we propose is Orthogonal Haar Wavelet Division Multiplexing(OHWDM). For OHWDM receiver, DWT and demodulation algorithms are implemented and for WCDMA, RAKE receiver is implemented. Wavelet transform is increasingly being used in analysis and detection of signals. In this article we discuss the concept of wavelets, different forms of wavelets, and their Fourier transforms. We have also discussed the comparative advantages of wavelet transforms over Fourier transforms in analyzing signals. In this study we try to present how discrete functions are represented in wavelet form, especially in the Haar wavelet representation. © 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The natural polymers always have exceptional properties which make them distinct from the synthetic polymers and tamarind seed polysaccharide (TSP) is one such example which shows more valuable properties making it a useful excipient for a wide range of applications. TSP is a natural polysaccharide obtained from the seeds of Tamarindus indica, recently gaining a wide potential in the field of pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. Its isolation and characterisation involve simple techniques resulting in cost-effective yield in its production. TSP shows uniqueness in its high drug holding capacity, high swelling index and high thermal stability, especially necessary for various novel drug delivery systems. It also plays the role of stabiliser, thickener, binder, release retardant, modifier, suspending agent, viscosity enhancer, emulsifying agent, as a carrier for novel drug delivery systems in oral, buccal, colon, ocular systems, nanofabrication, wound dressing and is also becoming an important part of food, cosmetics, confectionery and bakery. Various studies and experiments have been carried out to prove its multi-functional potentiality, from which it can be concluded that TSP can be a promising natural polysaccharide having enormous applications.

abstract={Service process performance of an organization should be measured continuously to achieve competitive advantage and this is possible through providing excellent service by any organization. The quality of the products or the quality of customer service determines the degree of customer satisfaction. The customer satisfaction not only means, satisfying the customers but also customer retention in case of service failure. The organization should solve the complaints through various service recovery strategies. It is mandatory to identify the impact of service failure and customer feedback for the survival, success and prosperity of an organization. The real victory of an organization is based on the degree of loyalty of the customers. This paper attempts to summarize the results of literature review on customer satisfaction towards the services of a bank from five different perspectives namely, service encounters, waiting time of the customer to get the service, role of intermediaries, quality of service provided and customer complaints towards the bank. Attraction, retention and enhancement of the customer relationship are essential to maintain, delighted and committed customers, who form the basis for the sustainable competitive position of the bank.

abstract={Attribute selection also called as feature selection is a preprocessing technique to select a set of features or subset of features from the available large collection of features. An artificial neural network is the simulation of a human brain which learns with experience. Efficiency of a model or a system in terms of cost, time and accuracy will greatly improve if proper features of a system are selected. This proposed method uses Artificial Neural Network for selecting the interesting or important features from the input layer of the network. A Multi Layer Perceptron Neural Network is used for selection of interesting features from a Ischemic heart data base with 712 patients. Initially the number of attributes was 17 and after feature selection the number of attributes was reduced to 12. All combination of features is attempted as Inputs of a Neural Network. When the input features become 12 the predicted accuracy during training is high as 87.36% using 10 - fold cross validation. Further removal of features lowers the accuracy and hence the interesting attributes selected for prediction is concluded to be as 12 for this Ischemic Heart Disease data set. © 2005 - 2012 JATIT & LLS.

abstract={Application areas of signal processing have grown dramatically in importance in recent times, in parallel with the growth of powerful and low-cost processing chips. This has led, in turn, to many new applications, including multimedia delivery and hand-held communications delivery. Image processing is one an important application among them, which has a strong mathematical basis. Specifically authors demonstrate point processes which use only the information in individual pixels to produce new images. Arithmetic operations, XOR operations, histograms, contrast stretching and intensity transformations are implemented using Xilinx System Generator (XSG). XSG is a useful tool to understand fundamental Digital Signal Processing (DSP) algorithms for Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) implementation. FPGAs provide a better platform for real-time algorithms on application-specific hardware with substantially greater performance than programmable DSPs.

abstract={In modern portable devices, the supply voltage is decreased to reduce the power dissipation. However as the supply voltage is scaled down below 0.4V, the normal MOSFET devices cannot be used due to lower ION/ IOFF ratio which will reduce the static power dissipation. Hence for low power applications, Tunnel FET is used as alternatives due to their higher sub threshold swing, extremely low off state current (IOFF) and excellent sub threshold characteristics. Hence Tunnel FET transistor has attracted a lot of attention for analog and RF applications. In Tunnel FET, the dynamic power dissipation will be decreased since the operating voltage is very low (0.4). The power consumption becomes a major bottleneck for further scaling. The continued reduction of MOSFET size is leading to increased leakage current due to short channel effects. A promising alternative for MOSFET which does not suffer from these limitations is Tunneling FET. In this work, characterizing the various parameters of Tunnel FET such as on current, off current, Transconductance generation factor for ultra low power analog applications. © 2005 - 2012 JATIT &amp; LLS.},

Images captured by cameras /video cameras have noise due to the electromagnetic and other geographic,atmospheric conditions, incorrect photo count. Hence removing noises from an image is a challenging task in image processing. Second, edge detection is one of the first steps of feature extraction. Edge detection characterizes the boundaries in the image and thus reduces the amount of data and also filters out the unnecessary information from the image and provides the structural properties of the image. There are many algorithms for both de-noising and edge detection on images. This paper discusses the mean and median filter for de-noising the radiographic images and the different edge detection techniques on radiographic de-noised images and compared them. © 2005 - 2012 JATIT & LLS.},

abstract={The need for value added and differentiated services such as video-telephony, internet TV etc in the broadband access hardware continue to increase rapidly nowadays, so we need to analyze the capabilities of the broad band access network architecture whether it can meet the design challenges for providing triple -play services (e.g. video on demand, voice IP).these services generally consumes very high bandwidth, highly delay sensitive and requires efficient hardware. Most of the service provider based broad band access network has a DSLAM which is a high end network multiplexer; a DSLAM should be completely analyzed based on the following design challenges such as bandwidth scalability, packet scheduling with less complexity, quality of service (QoS) assurance and a good application support. Because implementing triple service in a network needs an intelligent access hardware which adopts itself to meet the requirements. So the ultimate aim of this paper is to focus on the design challenges and the emerging recent trends in triple-play service deployment and how Intelligent DSLAM facilitates itself to meet the challenges in terms of selecting appropriate network processor and aggregation network migration. © 2005 - 2012 JATIT & LLS.},

abstract={This study deals with Reduction of cycle time which is very important element considered in successful manufacturing now-a-days. Clearly, long cycle times cause high inventory, high cost and very poor customer service. Cycle time reduction has a good predictable role in operation of CNC and Non-Conventional machining processes. Reducing cycle time requires eliminating non-value added activities which does not add value to the product manufactured. Examples of non-value added activity includes machine set-up, inspection and scheduled delays. The parameters considered in this context are speed, feed, depth of cut, hand-offs etc., these parameters should not violate any of the constraints that may apply on the process and satisfy the objective function such as reducing cycle time, maximizing the production rate, reduction in costs, increase throughput, streamline process, improved communications, process variability reduction or combinations of the above functions. In this study, a major component is considered with turning, facing, grooving, threading, boring and drilling operations. Non-Value added activities not only the processes but also the unnecessary hand-offs of the operators which will increase the time to produce a component. The various operations performed on the component will be reduced to reduce the time required to produce the component. Now-a-days customers are asking for short span delivery time to satisfy their needs with good quality products which will be helpful for the organization keeping the old customers and increasing the new customers number. Cycle time of this component can be reduced by varying speed, feed and depth of cut. The objective of the study is obtained by changing the process/production type, pre machining the components and also by implementing new tool called form tool. © 2012 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

abstract={The signals obtained from a system generally contain a number of unwanted information, termed noise, which needs to be removed during the pre-processing of the signals, for further analysis. Unprocessed ultrasonic welding defect signals, which contain noise, are not easily identified for the type and pattern of flaws they contain. Especially with TOFD welding defect signals which is often mixed with noise, distinction between grain noise and small flaws is not always easy. Presence of larger grain noise makes it difficult to interpret the defect result and noise. Thus, it is of great importance to de-noise the ultrasonic welding defect signal before classification of defect is carried out. This paper mainly focuses on the use of wavelet packet method using Stein's Unbiased Estimation of Risk(SURE) to de-noise the TOFD welding defect signals and the results has been compared with that of Split Spectrum Processing (SSP) with Polarity Thresholding algorithm (PT) for de-noising of the same. © 2005 - 2012 JATIT & LLS.

abstract={Document clustering generates clusters from the whole document collection automatically and is used in many fields, including data mining and information retrieval. Clustering text data faces a number of new challenges. Among others, the volume of text data, dimensionality, sparsity and complex semantics are the most important ones. These characteristics of text data require clustering techniques to be scalable to large and high dimensional data, and able to handle sparsity and semantics. In the traditional vector space model, the unique words occurring in the document set are used as the features. But because of the synonym problem and the polysemous problem, such a bag of original words cannot represent the content of a document precisely. Most of the existing text clustering methods use clustering techniques which depend only on term strength and document frequency where single terms are used as features for representing the documents and they are treated independently which can be easily applied to non-ontological clustering. To overcome the above issues, this paper makes a survey of recent research done on ontology or thesaurus based document clustering. © 2005 - 2012 JATIT & LLS. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Wireless sensor network provides a useful method to acquire and monitor the physiological signals of a patient. Bluetooth has a wide variety of applications in the medical field. Previously in a patient monitoring system, the physiological signals of a patient are transferred by using piconet. And it has some drawbacks such as limited number of nodes and limited communication range. To overcome these drawbacks, we proposed a system using Bluetooth scatternet. In this proposed model three piconets are interconnected to form Scatternet Sensor Network. The first and second piconet consists of one master node (local nurse) and five slaves nodes (patients). The third piconet consists of one master node (Chief nurse) and three slave nodes (Chief Doctors). Chief nurse act as a bridge node, which interconnect three piconets. The patients are at 24×7 critical care. If anything critical occurs, the Chief Doctor receives the data and sends acknowledge to the concerned patient. Furthermore, with the help of this system, medical personnel can take care of a few patients simultaneously, and thus, the personnel expenses can be reduced. © 2005 - 2012 JATIT & LLS.

abstract={Shrinkage is a reduction in inventory due to shoplifting, employee theft, paper work errors and supplier fraud. If the shrinkage amount is large for a company obviously it will result in the net profit deterioration. In this paper we propose a model to reduce shrinkage in a retail industry using data mining. The barcode of a product is taken as the primary key. The access to this key should be with one trusted party and the remaining database can be accessed by anyone. Maintaining barcode for the product types such as stationery, groceries will solve this problem. This is done by using the data mining tool and presented in a pictorial representation. For instance, in the observed pattern if the quantity of the barcoded product exceeds the quantity of the product available, it can be identified as a shoplifted item. Using the tool the data pattern extracted from the dataset will contain the information of that particular item. Thus the theft can be identified and prevented. The reliability of our model lies in the trust of the administrator who can access the primary key. © 2005 - 2012 JATIT & LLS. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In today's world internet is being used by almost everyone. Numerous file exchanges take place online including many official documents. These files require some sort of security mechanisms while being transmitted over the internet. Cryptography is one such means by which a person can encrypt the data and send it through the internet. This way the data is safe and unreadable for the intruders. In this paper we have proposed a system which combines the advantages of parallel processing and cryptographic algorithms. The use of parallel processing enhances the speed of system when compared to the traditional crypto systems. In our approach we have divided a file into two slices and have applied a single algorithm with different key for each slice and the processing of the algorithm is done in a parallel environment. From our experiments we found out that the execution time of a cryptographic algorithm is considerably reduced in a parallel environment when compared to the generic sequential methods. © 2005 - 2012 JATIT & LLS.

As test size increases memory capacity also increases, which becomes the major difficulty in testing System-on-Chip (SoC). To reduce the test data volume, several compression techniques have been proposed. Code based schemes is one among those compression techniques. Run length coding is one of the most popular coding methodology in code based compression. Run length codes like Golomb code, Frequency directed run Length Code (FDR code), Extended FDR, Modified FDR, Shifted Alternate FDR and OLEL coding compress the test data and the compression ratio increases drastically. For further reduction of test data, double compression technique is proposed using Huffman code.

abstract={User Authentication in computer systems is an important cornerstone in today's computer era. The concept of a user id and password is one of the easiest ways for authentication. It is not only the easiest way, but also cost effective and highly efficient. Today, we can see the password cracking and hacking in everywhere. At present we are using the single server system for this sort of password based authentication. Traditional protocols for password-based authentication assume a single server which stores all the information (e.g., the password) necessary to authenticate a user. When an attacker obtains the information stored on the server, he can obtain all the passwords which were stored in the server via launching an offline dictionary attack. To address this issue, a number of schemes have been proposed in which a user's password information is shared among multiple servers, and these servers cooperate in a threshold manner the user wants to authenticate. In this paper, a new efficient two-server password-only based authentication is proposed. In addition, the system is secure against offline dictionary attacks mounted by either of the two servers. © 2005 - 2012 JATIT & LLS. All rights reserved.},

abstract={A fundus camera provides digitised data in the form of a fundus image that can be effectively used for the computerised automated detection of diabetic retinopathy. A completely automated screening system for the disease can largely reduces the burden of the specialist and saves cost. Noise and other disturbances that occur during image acquisition may lead to false detection of the disease and this is overcome by various image processing techniques. Following this different features are extracted which serves as the guideline to identify and grade the severity of the disease. Based on the extracted features classification of the retinal image as normal or abnormal is brought about. In literature various techniques for feature extraction and different types of classifiers have been used to improve sensitivity and specificity. FROC analysis and confusion matrix are used to evaluate the system performance. In this paper critical analysis of various algorithms and classifiers is done that have been used for the automated diagnosis. © 2005 - 2012 JATIT & LLS. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Electrospinning is a versatile technique to make biomimetic and nanostructured scaffolds for skin tissue engineering. In this study we have electrospun and characterized chitosan (C)-poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) blend nanofibers as dermal substitutes and compared with 2D C-PVA films. The in vitro characterization of the C-PVA nanofibers and 2D films were evaluated using mouse 3T3 fibroblast cells and our results demonstrated that the cells adhered and proliferated on the surface of C-PVA nanofibers. In our animal studies, the implantation of C-PVA nanofibers along with topical administration of growth factor R-Spondin 1 on full thickness wounds created on rats showed 98.6% wound closure after two weeks post-surgery. The catalase and superoxide dismutase activity of the healing tissue was significantly higher in the groups treated with topical administration of growth factor and C-PVA nanofibers (p < 0.05). Thus these C-PVA nanofibers along with novel growth factor are promising new biomaterials that could be used as dermal substitutes for accelerated wound healing. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Ontology is also used to represent user profiles in personalized web information gathering. For representing user profiles many models have been developed, these models provide knowledge from either a global or local knowledge base. The global analysis uses existing global knowledge bases and to produce effective performance. The local analysis observes user behavior in user profiles. The user background knowledge can be better discovered and represented if we integrate global and local analysis. Our model proposes to bring out data from global resources depending on the user whose profiles match the global content. Compared with other models ontology model has an edge.

abstract={The Mobile industry has witnessed a tremendous growth in the past few years with the advent of 2G, 3G and 3.5G technologies. The essence of these technologies' lie in higher data rates, video telephony, highspeed internet and lot many others which provide reliable, uninterrupted and healthy communication among the users. This must ensure that the User equipment (UE) adheres to the standards proposed and meets all the requirements as specified by the standard bodies. This paper is concerned about verifying the functionality of UMTS protocol stack in User equipment through 3G conformance testing. This is carried out in a simulated network environment where different scenarios scripted in TTCN language are run to ensure that the implementations meet the standards proposed by 3GPP, which is referred to as Conformance testing. This would indeed help the certification bodies like GCF and PTCRB to certify the user equipment. This paper presents the test bench architecture, the environment and testing process which involves testing of various procedures and features in the UMTS. Testing of various features on the User equipment makes it versatile and most significantly qualifies the user equipment. Thus Conformance testing plays an important role in the mobile industry where the user equipment has to pass the minimum requirement in order to reach the user. © 2005 - 2012 JATIT & LLS.

abstract={Determinants play an important role to decide whether matrix is singular or not. It is known that when determinant of matrix is zero, the matrix is noninvertible or singular matrix. This paper presents special properties for forming singular matrix. When square matrix is formed using those properties, the resultant matrix is degenerate i.e singular matrix. Determinant of the matrix thus formed is zero except matrix of order 1 X 1 and 2 X 2 and the matrix satisfies the most of the properties of the determinant. In this paper, we have shown how matrix of order n X n can be constructed by using special properties. We subject the new matrix thus formed to various arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction and multiplication), the resultant matrices are all singular. The results of these operations show that all resultant matrices produced as result of these operations except the multiplication satisfies the special properties. Any matrix that obeys the special properties is singular and the determinant value is equal to the difference between the sums of main diagonal and off diagonal elements. This paper will help researchers construct singular matrices that can be used for providing information security solutions. © 2005 - 2012 JATIT & LLS. All rights reserved.},

Since this model was developed on Matlab system generator and synthesized using Xilinx platform, it can be easily implemented on FPGA.

The field of decision making is the study both of how decisions are actually made and how they can be made better or more successfully. Bellman[1] has shown that applications of fuzzy sets within the field of decision making have consisted of extensions or fuzzifications of the classical theories of decision making. While decision making under conditions of risk and uncertainty have been modeled by probabilistic decision theories, fuzzy decision making theories attempt to deal with the vagueness or fuzziness inherent in subjective or imprecise determinations of preferences, constraints and goals. Tanaka[4] formulated a fuzzy decision problem and applied successfully to an investment problem. Dubois[2] discussed the use of fuzzy numbers in decision analysis. Multistage decision processes in a fuzzy environment was studied by Kacprzyk [3]. © 2005 - 2012 JATIT & LLS. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In all System-on-a-Chip (SoC) designs, there is a necessity to reduce the large test data volume and this is achieved by test data compression. One of the methods is the variable-to-variable length compression method. A selective run-length based compression which comes under variable-to-variable method is presented in this paper. The proposed work is based on threshold calculation on don't cares (X). So compression is not targeted for all the test patterns. Depending upon threshold value compression is identified. The test patterns having large number of don't-cares (X's) are selected for compression. Also the test vectors having less compression ratio is not considered for compression by calculating its threshold value. The selected test patterns can be divided into number of blocks containing equal number of test vectors. Each block is compared with the adjacent blocks bit-by-bit and it has to be merged. The number of blocks merged can be given in the control code. The experiments are conducted on ISCAS'89 benchmark circuits to know the effectiveness of the compression technique. The results show that the technique has a reasonable effect on compression. © 2005 - 2012 JATIT & LLS. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Sub-micron dispersions of 'sand in water' have been prepared by stirred bead milling of the micron-sized sand particles, followed by probe ultrasonication. The dependence of dispersion viscosity and thermal conductivity on particle volume concentration has been studied. The influence of ultrasonication on the above transport properties has also been investigated. An estimated 4% and 10% increase in heat transfer coefficient may be obtained under turbulent and laminar flow conditions respectively by utilizing these dispersions as coolants. Further experimental studies in heat exchangers are required to ascertain the suitability of these dispersions for cooling applications. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Nanotechnology is an emerging research field that helps in reviving the structural design, synthesis and fabrication at the molecular magnitude. There are approximately 130 nanopharmaceutical products in development including~nanoparticles, nanocrystals, dendrimers, liposomes and micelles. The increase in the selectivity and stability of therapeutic agents can be achieved with the help of Nanoparticle drug-delivery system. But due to several factors such as drug leakage, reticuloendothelial system, (RES) uptake, immunogenicity, hydrophobicity, hemolytic toxicity, cytotoxicity, the use of nanostructures are restricted. These challenges can be overcome by surface engineering the dendrimer with bioactive agents either encapsulating into the interior of the dendrimer or by physically adsorbing them onto the surface of the demdrimer. Thus this surface engineering help to achieve the desired properties of the carrier as per the requirement of the active ingredient and it also gives an access for new potentially relevant polymer architectecture Some of the examples for surface engineering of dendrimers are Polyester dendrimer, Arginine dendrimer, Glycodendrimers, Citric acid dendrimer,PEGylated dendrimers, etc.},

abstract={SVM (Support Vector Machine) is a supervised learning which is a boon in disguise to the field of machine learning. Though a number of classifier seems to exist it gives better result and recognition rates for which it is opted the most. The other brighter side of SVM is that it minimizes the empirical error and maximizes the geometric region. Neural network has weakness such that they converge only to the locally best solutions. Whereas, SVM is far improved. SVM has the capability to select its own support vectors. In case of Back Propagation algorithm, we should know in advance the value of the output and once we receive a value after passing through the neurons, the two values are compared and if there is no match found, backtracking is done as a result of which weights are varied to obtain the exact value. The computational complexity is going to be very great. It proves to be a useful tool when the data is not regular or when the distribution is unknown. SVM gains its flexibility from the kernel which in turn makes it successful. This can provide a unique solution whereas neural networks have multiple solutions for each minima so it does not seem to be robust for different samples. The greater recognition rate and flexibility makes SVM popular. Accuracy, recognition rate is very important for the purpose of classification, only then authentication can be done effectively. This study has been evolved to reveal that SVM gives good accuracy and recognition rate compared to other classifiers and hence it is considered best for gait recognition. © 2005 - 2012 JATIT & LLS.

abstract={Usage of soft computing techniques in field study saves human labor. Field study plays a vital role in the economic importance of agriculture which in turn results in poverty reduction. Farmers guess the solutions to the disease based on the loss of plant life that occurred previously. Technology is used to support farmers and botanist which give precise solution for the vague input information. The human labor used in the existing system is replaced with technology in the proposed system which reduces the time complexity, increases the performance and overcomes the lack of satisfaction. Decision Support System is the computer-based expert information system to predict the output response of field with respect to the input parameters. Fuzzy Control application is programmed in Fuzzy Control Logic (FCL). In fuzzification the value of the input variables are converted into degrees of membership for the membership functions defined on that variable. Fuzzy set is any set that allows its members to have different grades of membership in the interval [0, 1]. Smartness of the fuzzy depends on the rule evaluation. The performance of the fuzzy machine is restricted by the capability of human brain. DSS based fuzzy system provides interactive, flexible and quick decision making. Use of latest technology provides profitable performance to the farmers. The limitations in existing system are overcome by using relational database which is used as database in field study through which large queries can be handled easily. Fuzzy logic is a powerful concept of handling non-linear, time-varying, adaptive systems. The knowledge-driven DSS is created for crop management in proposed system. © 2005 - 2012 JATIT & LLS.

In this paper, we compare three methodology of backup systems such as full backup, cumulative incremental backup and differential incremental backup. Full backups contain all data file blocks. Cumulative incremental backups contain blocks from level n-1 or lower. Restoration speed is faster than differential incremental backup but storage space occupy much more. Differential incremental backups contain only modified blocks from level n or lower.

abstract={The sharp growth of online-systems and vast availability of high quality data lead to information overload, increasingly very difficult for the online users to find most relevant content. When looking for information about any movie, music, video, the internet users come across a bewildering number of options to fetch precise data from the recommended list. The main goal of the recommender system is to suggest high quality and top rated videos to the user. However there exist thousands of video items said to be Long Tail (videos with least rating) that stagnate idle on the web server for years that are unrevealed by users because of its least rating. The new recommender system introduced in this paper uses rating based binning technique that favors not only top rated videos to get recommended, but also recommend Long-Tail videos. This can improve diversity on recommendation and suggest best long tail videos to the user. This implies that a least popular video has a high probability to become more popular when it is placed on the related video recommendation lists of popular videos. In order to evaluate the proposed video recommender system, the datasets are crawled from YouTube©, a well-liked online video community to suggest videos with high rating along with less rated long tail videos. © 2005 - 2012 JATIT &amp; LLS.

abstract={In this modern world ATM is being used by many of us. The security that is being currently used for ATM indeed has a few backdoors and it can be improved further. For the same reason biometric verification were introduced. But even the biometric system does not seem to be completely reliable and hence a contingency plan is needed in order to prevent catastrophes. Objective of this paper is to provide enhanced security to ATM by enhancing the already proposed biometric system and making it still secured by PII[Personal Identification Image] process. So a detailed study on various existing biometric systems is studied and also its limitations are listed. This paper proposes a novel method to meet out the challenges and strengthen the security mechanism. In the proposed security algorithm two phases are defined. These two phases provide two tier security and there by increases the security of ATM machine. © 2005 - 2012 JATIT & LLS. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The extensive use of the Internet, for exchanging information, requesting and offering services make us to interact with unknown entities. Human use trust to facilitate interaction and accept the risk, when complete information is unavailable. In such situations, trust establishment mechanisms enable establishment of trust between unknown entities. Trust is a complex concept to define stringently due to its multifaceted nature. This paper presents the characteristics of trust observed from various views and types of trust the automated trust establishment mechanisms need to model for the future. The confidence in the identity of the entity and the trust in that entity are the facilitator of trust for the proposed trust establishment mechanism. Finally, the objectives of the trust model, to be used by the future trust establishment mechanism are highlighted. © 2005 - 2012 JATIT & LLS. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Regional rainfall forecast is an important task for meteorologists. While statistical methods are usually in vogue, for this, the concept of data mining is applied to see the efficacy. The objective of this work is to develop a forecast method for the rainfall of the Northeast (NE) season over the Cauvery delta region of South India. There are three main parts in this work. The first part is in loading the meteorological data into centralized server so that it can be extracted and filtered according to our needs. Secondly, graphical visualization has been applied by using gnuplot. And finally the association rules have been mined from those former outputs. From these results we can assess the monthly and seasonal rainfall for the future. Results show that overall accuracy of this approach is satisfactory. © 2005 - 2012 JATIT & LLS.

abstract={Firewalls are the devices that we are used to protect data. It might be configured to allow certain devices or applications to access our network. The Firewalls are termed as stateful devices. Traditional firewalls typically need to inspect each packet to ensure that it adheres to the policy that has been configured or not, and then perform the necessary action associated to that particular rule. There are various actions and they are typically allow, deny, or even NAT the packet. Many Personal Computer Operating Systems include software-based Firewalls to protect against threats from the public Internet. Existing Firewall Technologies such as Cisco PIX Firewalls and Checkpoint FireWall-1 provide various software tools that allowing firewalls as Clustered or Grouped and these Configured Firewalls will share their loads. The main objectives of these existing technologies are to improve the Resource Utilization along with performance and Security. But however these techniques fail to achieve higher performance while focusing resource utilization. This is one of the serious issues. To address this problem, our research work is developed and implemented an efficient Adaptive Scheduler, which improves the network performance in terms of Resource Utilization, Delay and Throughput. This work also introduced Firewall Reduction Policy, which reduces firewall rules without compromising Security. From our Experimental results, it is established that this proposed technique reduces the computational cost, which leads to higher performance. © 2005 - 2012 JATIT & LLS. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Now a days clinical diagnosis is emerging with digital images. In this paper we have dealt with computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET) and Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI). Where CT is rich in denser tissue with less distortion. PET with border of anatomical structure are blurred. MRI image has the complementary property, which provides better information on soft tissues but with more distortion. By combining any of these two complementary images we end up with new image which contains denser tissue with lesser distortion. For this process we use Nonsubsampled Contourlet Transform to decompose the images and Pulse Coupled Neural Network is used to motivate the lower frequency pixels. Thereby the fused image's spatial property is improved. The exact edges of the fused images are found by applying it to a canny edge detection method to find tumour present in the FUSED image. © 2005 - 2012 JATIT & LLS. All rights reserved.},

abstract={On considering the current scenario, Most of the existing systems which offer security to a network or web or to a data are vulnerable to attacks and they are breached at some point of time by effective cryptanalysis, irrespective of its complex algorithmic design. In general, today's crypto world is restricted to a practice of following any one single encryption scheme and that too for a single iteration on a single file basis. This is evident in the 99% of the encryption-decryption cases. So, A need for "practically strong and infeasible to get attacked" technique becomes vital. In this paper, we propose a Software tool which involves Cryptographic enciphering and deciphering along with File Splitting and Merging mechanisms. We used modified Blowfish algorithm for Encryption and Decryption of data. Though we use only one algorithm, we differentiate the cryptographic scheme by varying the key for varying file slices. Our results clearly justifies that our tool serves as a better solution both in terms of performance as well as security. © 2005 - 2012 JATIT & LLS. All rights reserved.},

abstract={As mobile services and applications are becoming more pervasive with the increasing adoption of 3G networks and devices, verifying the different quality attributes in all parts of the system is important. This describes a testing platform for 3G User Equipment (UE) that allows effective testing of UE devices and applications in a laboratory environment. By simulating parts of the network, the platform provides a realistic yet controlled environment for testing. Using this platform, we have executed a number of tests on 3G UEs and applications. Based on our experiences we describe the specific challenges encountered in testing in a 3G network in contrast to testing in a more traditional environment. As the worldwide3G network deployment is scheduled for next upcoming years, mobile testing industry strives to supply test equipment with sufficiently good features to meet the needs.The biggest challenge is not only in customizing the new features quickly but also in making sure of the stability and robustness of the product. The test applications covered in this includes protocol conformance testing. Through practical experience, 3GPP has decided that the most efficient and cost-effective way to reach this goal is to create a certification system for mobile terminals. A certified mobile is tested to an agreed and continuously updated set of test cases. All test cases are developed, maintained and delivered by 3GPPand validated by a certification agreement group, such as the Global Certification Forum (GCF) or the Personal Communication System Type Certification Review Board (PTCRB)... The agreement group has the responsibility to ensure that each test case is performed on a range of commercially available test equipment, providing compatibility between test facilities. This paper describes an Automated Test-Bench Application for Mobile phones. © 2005 - 2012 JATIT & LLS. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Segmentation of vegetated areas is inevitable in precision agriculture and has high importance in urban area with social and environmental aspects. This paper addresses the segmentation of fused high resolution multispectral satellite images into distinct regions such as vegetation, buildings and barren land. Even though the IHS based fusion of satellite imagery improves the visual interpretation, it results in color distortion which can be nullified using vegetation indexes(VI). The vegetated area can be depicted using high resolution normalized vegetation index and to detect the distribution of vegetated area, soil classes, buildings and barren land. For that the coarse-to-fine level set method is used. Undecimated wavelet transform is adopted to separate focused areas from the background. Homogeneity metric is used to measure the variation inside and outside the contours. The weight distribution ratio is proposed to adaptively tune the relative weight of the features. Based on the homogeneity metric and the weight distribution ratio, a novel energy functional is developed to solve the contour extraction problem and a coarse-to-fine scheme is applied to progressively extract contours in finer scale which also reduces the computational burden. © 2005-2012 JATIT & LLS.

More recently, clustering has been proposed for use in browsing a collection of documents or in organizing the results returned by a search engine in response to a user's query. This paper presents a new semantic synonym based correlation indexing method in which documents are clustered based on nearest neighbors from the document collection and then further refined by semantically relating the query term with the retrieved documents by making use of a thesaurus or ontology model to improve the performance of Information Retrieval System (IRS) by increasing the number of relevant documents retrieved.

abstract={Crack detection in pavements and objects has been a constant field of research in pavement management. Conventionally, humans were engaged to detect cracks in the pavements and they used to present report sheets based on their assessment. But, this process was a time consuming one and was costlier too. So, researchers were trying for some alternate method that would detect cracks, hence minimizing the human involvement and at the same time detecting the cracks precisely. This gave way to numerous automated techniques for the detection of cracks. In this paper, an automated technique to detect cracks in pavements by means of digital image processing is proposed. This technique detects the horizontal, vertical and diagonal cracks on buildings, pavements, soils, roads, objects, etc. Some conditions such as complex texture, bad illumination, and non-uniform background in images may influence the accuracy of the automatic system. So, a lot of work has been made to overcome these hardships and to provide a wellorganized method for crack detection. First, the images are processed by gray scale morphological processing. Subsequently, the final result is obtained by filtering the images (Butterworth filter) and then applying the edge detection operators (canny). By visual inspection, contented detection results are obtained through this method. © 2005 - 2012 JATIT & LLS. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The present study investigates the potential use of tea waste for the production of lactic acid using Lactobacillus plantarum MTCC 6161.The tea waste comprise of tannin, which acts as a carbon source, which upon microbial activity gets converted to glucose. In this study, initially the effects of four process variables namely yeast extract concentration, moisture content, substrate concentration, and (NH 4) 2SO 4 concentration were studied using fractional factorial design (FFD). From FFD it was found out that yeast extract concentration, moisture content and substrate concentrations had statistically significant effect on lactic acid concentration in the final product. Consequently, these variables were optimized through response surface methodology. A central composite design was used for this purpose. A quadratic model was proposed to predict the lactic acid concentration. Maximum lactic acid concentration was achieved when amount of yeast extract, amount of substrate (tea waste), and moisture content were 0.2 g, 11 g and 80% respectively. Corresponding lactic acid concentration was estimated to be 13.82 g/L. The results thus suggest that tea waste, otherwise waste, can be used to produce lactic acid.},

Two types, river sand and crusher dust four single sizes namely 1.18 mm, 0.600 mm, 0.300 mm, 0.150 mm and for single gradation of each fine aggregate were considered in the present research work. In total, 103 mortar batches was made with three different sand to cement ratios [s/c] and two different water to cement ratios [w/c] to find out the flowability of mortar and tested using standard flow table. Out of 103 mortar batches, 52 were with river sand and 51 were with crusher dust. Tests were performed as per ASTM 109 standards. S/c ratio varied from 1 to 3 with an increment of one and w/c ratio was chosen in such a way that all the mixes to give measurable flow. The influence of particle shape and surface texture of aggregate were characterized with an angularity test based on ASTM C1252 in terms of percent of air voids in a loosely compacted fine aggregate. The results indicate that the size of aggregate and uncompacted void content have greater impact flowability of mortar. Mortar made with river sand has got better flowability than that of mortar made with crusher dust due to its higher degree of irregularities. Mortar with higher aggregate content has low percentage of spread compared to mortar with low aggregate content. Similarly, graded aggregate has lesser percentage of spread due to its proper packing compared to single sized aggregates. © 2012 Korean Society of Civil Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Purpose: To investigate the effect of Manasamitra vatakam (MMV), an Ayurvedic formulation, on aluminium (Al)-induced neurotoxicity in rats. Methods: Wistar rats were selected for the present study and were divided into four groups of six animals each. Group I (control) received tap water while group II received aluminium chloride (AlCl3, 100 mg/kg/day). Group III was treated with concurrently Al chloride (100 mg/kg/day) and MMV drug (100 mg/kg /day). Group IV were administered MMV (100 mg/kg/day) for 90 days. Behavioral tests were performed on the rats during the experiment. At the end of the experiment various biochemical, neurochemical and histopathological histopathological was assessments were also carried out on the blood and brain of the rats. Results: Following MMV treatment, there was a significant recovery in the performance of the radial maze and muscle grip strength of the rats, as well as the levels of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), ribonucleic acid (RNA), and acetylcholinestrase (AChE) in different parts of the rat's brain. The neuroprotective efficacy of MMV was supported by histopathological observations. Furthermore, MMV afforded protection against oxidative damage in the rats. Conclusion: MMV prevents Al-induced toxicity in peripheral as well as in central nervous systems of rats. Therefore, further studies are required to ascertain its usefulness in humans.

abstract={DC-DC converters are extensively used in the modern telecommunication and consumer electronics. Design of such converters is a challenge for electrical engineers due to the user requirements and the inherent non linear nature. When the required output does not follow the set-point, a controller is to be used with objective of keeping the error as minimum. For a DC-DC converter, the input and load variations are major reasons which alter the proper functioning. The controller for such DC-DC converter is a circuit or an algorithm which changcs the Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) waveform by adjusting the ON-OFF timings thereby keeping the output at the desired value. Quick settling time and rise time to the desired output along with high efficiency, required phase margin, loop bandwidth are the main constraints on the controller. Design of such controller is the main purpose of this research paper. Two types of controllers arc designed namely PID controller and Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC). PID controller is tuned using Internal Model Control (IMC) method and Ziegler Nicholas (ZN) method. FLC with optimum number of rules is designed. The above controllers are compared and it is found that FLC gives the minimum settling time of 1.9ms, overshoot percentage of 13.78 and rise time of 0.654ms. The output variations due to line voltage and load changcs arc also found to be minimum with FLC. © 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={This paper presents a new method for estimating the rotor resistance of an induction motor. The rotor resistance changes significantly with temperature and frequency. This variation has a major influence on the field oriented control performance of an induction motor due to the deviation of slip frequency from the set value. In conventional MRAS, the adaptation is done using a PI-controller. The MRAS approach using reactive power as a functional candidate for rotor resistance estimation makes MRAS computationally simpler and easy to design. This paper proposes the role of neural learning algorithm for adaptation in a MRAS based rotor resistance estimator. The proposed scheme combines the advantages of reactive power technique and the capability of neural network to form a scheme named "Neural Learning-Reactive Power Model Reference (NL-RPMR) based rotor resistance estimator" for Induction Motor Drives. In the NL-RPMR scheme, the error between neural network model and reference model is back propagated to adjust the weights of the neural network of the estimator. The performance of NL-RPMR based rotor resistance estimator is extensively simulated and compared with the conventional MRAS method. The promising results obtained are presented. © 2005 - 2012 JATIT & LLS. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This paper deals with a detailed analysis and FPGA implementation of the Neural Learning Algorithm based MRAS Rotor Resistance Estimator to enhance the performance of the Vector Controlled Induction Motor drive. Variation of Induction Motor parameter causes detuning which is undesirable in high performance drives. Among all the parameters the rotor resistance of the Induction Motor is of paramount importance as they vary with temperature, frequency and skew effects and also the exact value of rotor resistance is required for the unit vector generation and slip calculation in an Indirect Field Oriented Control Scheme. The MRAS scheme using reactive power as a functional candidate for rotor resistance estimation makes the MRAS computationally simpler and easy to implement. The performance of the estimator, torque and flux responses of the drive together with the estimator is investigated with the help of MATLAB simulation for variations in the rotor resistance from their nominal value. The rotor resistance is estimated experimentally, using the neural learning algorithm based MRAS rotor resistance estimator which is implemented in FPGA. Simulation and Experimental results have been presented to confirm the effectiveness of the technique. © 2012 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.},

Inhibition of cell proliferation and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release increased in a time and dose-dependent manner. Further, reduced glutathione (GSH), glutathione transferase (GST) and protein levels decreased and lipid peroxidation increased significantly on RC treatment in a dose dependent manner when compared to controls. Based on the results we determined the optimal dose as 30mg/ ml and the apoptotic effect of RC extract (30 mg/ml) on HEp-2 cells was confirmed by fluorescent microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) based on morphological and ultrastructural changes. RC extract suppressed the proliferation of HEp-2 oral cancer cells inducing apoptotic cell death in vitro.

abstract={In recent time, the Internet has become as a efficient and effective platform of disclosure of banks' information. This study is an attempt to analyse the level and intensity of effectiveness of information disclosure of banks operating in India on their websites. For the purpose of this study, a Bank Disclosure Attribute Index (with four attributes such as general attribute, financial attribute, investor attribute, and corporate governance attribute) developed by Charumathi et al (2009) was identified and used. Each bank's website was explored to identify the availability of the above attributes. The sample for this study includes all the 80 (Nationalized bank(19), SBI associate bank(8), Private banks(22) and Foreign banks(31). This study used statistical tools such as Chi Square Test, bi-vitiate correlation and ANOVA. This study threw light on the adequacy of information disclosure by banks operating in India besides studying the uniformity among the banks in each of the attributes. It also found the correlation between the overall disclosure and four categories of attributes such as general attribute, financial attribute, investor attribute, and corporate governance attribute. This study is more significant according to the International Accounting Standards Board framework. Due to inadequacy and non-uniform in the disclosure of information, the disclosure characteristics would compromise in internet. The quality of information, relevance of data in the present context, usefulness and timeliness of Information are some of compromised characteristics of reporting information on the internet. © 2012 SASTRA UNIVERSITY.},

The substantially elevated serum marker enzymes such as Aspartate transaminase (AST), Alanine transaminase (ALT), Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), Acid phosphatase (ACP) and the antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and catalase were found due to CCl4treatment. The levels of above mentioned enzymes were brought to near normalcy after administration of plant extract. The biochemical parameters like total protein, total bilirubin were also restored towards normal levels. In addition Eclipta prostrata significantly decrease the liver weight of CCl4 intoxicated rats. Silymarin at a dose level of 25mg/kg was used as a standard reference drug for comparison.. The results of this study strongly indicate that Eclipta prostrata is having a potent hepatoprotective action against CCl4 induced hepatic damage in rats.},

abstract={The present study evaluates the anti-arthritic effect of Spirulina fusiformis on formaldehyde induced Rheumatoid arthritis in mice. Arthritis was induced by intradermal injection of formaldehyde (0.1 ml of 2%v/v) into the right hind paw of Swiss albino mice. Spirulina fusiformis (500mg/kg b.wt & 1000mg/kg/b.wt) was orally administrated for 10 days. The anti arthritic effect of Spirulina fusiformis was evaluated by measuring changes in the paw volume, body weight, protein, uric acid, serum and liver lysosomal enzymes such as Acid phosphatase, β-glucuronidase and β- galactosidase, protein-bound carbohydrates such as hexose, hexosamine, fucose in control and experimental groups. In formaldehyde induced arthritic animals, the levels of lysosomal enzymes in serum and liver were decreased and the levels of protein-bound carbohydrates and paw volume were increased. However the body weight was found to be reduced when compared to control animals. Oral administration of Spirulina fusiformis (1000mg/kg/b.wt) significantly altered these physical and biochemical changes observed in arthritic animals to near normal conditions. Hence results of this study clearly indicate that Spirulina fusiformis has promising anti-arthritic activity against formaldehyde induced rheumatoid arthritic animals.},

abstract={The invention of field oriented control of a three phase cage induction motor has enabled its adoption in variety of high performance drive applications demanding independent dynamic control of air gap flux and torque. At the same time, this technique is computationally intensive and is highly sensitive to variations in motor parameters, especially the rotor and stator resistances. Accordingly, maintaining the field orientation in the machine in the presence of environmental changes is a challenging task, necessitating on-line estimation of Rr and Rs parameters. Among the different approaches for parameter estimation proposed during the last decade, MRAS based Rotor Resistance Estimator using Rotor Flux and Reactive Power has gained prominence. In this paper, a detailed study of Neural Learning Algorithm based MRAS Rotor Resistance Estimator using Reactive power (NLRP-MRAS) for retaining field orientation is presented and compared with MRAS Rotor Resistance Estimator using Rotor Flux (NLRF-MRAS). Choice of Reactive power as the adaptive variable makes the Rotor Resistance estimation and there by field oriented control independent of stator resistance variation which is not possible with the rotor flux as the adaptive variable. This scheme also makes the estimation of parameters at low speed quite accurate. The simulation results in MATLAB/SIMULINK platform are presented for different operating conditions to verify the effectiveness of this technique. © 2012 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l.},

Even though some sites undergo verification process, it is only just by using their email and mobile number they submit at that instance. This allow users to have more than one registration and all these registrations may not contain the same data. The best feasible solution is the Centralized database, which may not be feasible for heterogeneous databases. These issues are discussed in our previous paper and we suggested a method URGA (User Registration Gateway Algorithm). In this paper we analyzed the scenario by conducting online survey, Baye's rule of conditional probability to find genuinety of the user.

abstract={Social network Sites (SNS) are the major source for social capital[6], now a day's dynamic mining [2] is a part of its activity for many organizations. Interestingly on the other end we can see that most of the users are having more than one registration on social networks [6] has been associated with two fold effects in positive and negative shades. Many young users are using these networks for adolescents [10] and for downloading free entertainment stuff, which may leads to lot of fake user registrations. Just receiving invitation to their emails, creates some of the user profiles and it then pulls the userdata of the mail account. The profile created may not be correct and this was copied [11] may lead to false or redundant information on the network domain. This became a common problem for all organizations, websites who are associated with the SNS to find many facts like number of users registered and tracking any person also sometime it may leads to ambiguity problem. As one may contain more than one profile created by her/him intentionally or unknowingly generated by anyone way specified above. Recent issues on SNS says that most of the Popular Indian film actress were defamed with fake user profiles which were created in Twitter by unknown persons and posted some morphing photos and cheap comments. These acts attracted most researchers to concentrate on providing solutions. The best feasible solution is the Centralized database, which may not be feasible for heterogeneous databases. so to overcome this we are proposing a technique in this paper known as URGA(User Registration Gateway Algorithm). © 2005 - 2012 JATIT & LLS.

abstract={Minor defects in insulation system of power apparatus such as cracks, inclusions, protrusions etc are unavoidable leading to partial discharges (PD). Since recognition of PD sources is essential for diagnosis and as multiple sources are encountered during real-time measurements, an array of techniques such as Neural Networks (NN), Wavelet Transformation etc have been attempted by researchers for classifying single and partially overlapped PD sources with moderate success. Since PD is a complex non-Markovian process displaying statistical variations among correlated patterns, Hidden Markov Model (HMM) serves as a viable tool in recognizing spatio-temporal and dynamically varying signatures. Hence a non-stationary continuous density HMM (CDHMM) which expresses the hidden state transition probabilities as time-dependant estimates with multivariate Gaussian densities is implemented. A novel hybrid non-stationary CDHMM-Probabilistic Neural Network recognition system is developed which utilizes the complementary advantages of HMM for identification of pattern sequences and NN for discrimination. Exhaustive studies are carried out on benchmark models and industrial objects to determine the efficacy of the hybrid system in comparison with its stationary counterpart. The focus of the research is on analyzing the role of the optimal state transition sequence of the nonstationary version in capturing the dynamic characteristic of PD patterns. © 2012 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All right reserved.},

abstract={Twenty-five surficial sediment samples, collected on board ORV Sagar Kanya during her 199th and 200th cruises along a north-south transect between latitudes 9.69°N and 55.01°S, and longitudes 80°E and 40°E were studied for isotopic variations (values of δ18O and δ13C) of the indicator planktonic species Globigerina bulloides. The results indicate that from latitudes 9.69°N to 15°S both these isotopes (δ18O and δ13C) fluctuated significantly. Between latitudes from around 15°S to 30-35°S δ18O values steadily increased, whereas δ13C showed a decreasing trend. However, to the south of latitudes 30-35°S, both isotope values showed a similar response with a gradual increase up to latitude 50°S, beyond which δ18O continued to increase while δ13C declined. The characteristic patterns of the values of both isotopes indicates that the signatures of different water masses are associated with various frontal systems and/or water masses across the transect. The signature of the Polar Front at around latitude 50°S shows the specific response of the isotopic values (δ18O and δ13C) of G. bulloides. Such a response beyond 50°S latitude is ascribable to the general decrease in the ambient temperature, resulting in a continuous increase in δ18O values, while δ13C values decrease as a result of reduced photosynthesis in regions approaching higher latitudes owing to low light penetration. To further corroborate our results, those of many such transects from geographically distinct regions need to be studied for isotopic variations in the calcareous shells of planktonic foraminiferal species. The results have the potential to be used as a proxy to assess the movement of frontal systems in southern high latitude regions. © Polish Academy of Sciences, Institute of Oceanology, 2012.},

abstract={OFDM is a promising technique for high bit rate transmission systems. In previous for a given transmit power constraint, the capacity region can be regarded as the set of low optimal operational with low number of users. In order to improve the QOS we need a new system. The Bit Error Rate (BER) of the scheme for binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) is also presented. Specifically, an algorithm is proposed that exploits the structure of the OFDM channel and whose convergence speed is essentially insensitive to the number of subcarriers. To improve the capacity dynamic routing, traffic scheduling, burst allocation and load balancing concepts are used. In dynamic routing the network destination is dynamically discovered. Traffic scheduling is used to improve the fairness. Load balancing is used to distribute the load evenly among the cell nodes. Burst allocation is used to choose the cyclic prefix. © 2005 - 2012 JATIT & LLS. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Micro array sample classification has been studied extensively using classification techniques in machine learning and pattern recognition. In a micro array chip, the number of genes available is far greater than that of samples, which is a serious problem and the gene expression reduction, is important one. Prior to sample classification, it is important to perform gene selection and more interpretable genes to be identified as biomarkers, so that a more efficient, accurate, and reliable performance in classification can be achieved. For this purpose, a hybrid scheme was proposed and this scheme is called as Single Filter - Single Wrapper Classifier (SFSW). In this technique, the Filter approach is used to select the data sets from the large Micro array and the Wrapper approach is used to classify the gene expressions from the selected data sets. From the available statistical report, it is revealed that the Filter method has a fast dimensionality reduction step for selecting a small set of genes at the cost of accuracy and the Wrapper method used for improving classification accuracy on this small set of genes at the cost of computational delay. However this approach also has some problems such as different filtered subset leads to complex evaluation. Hence an Efficient Hybrid Classifier called "Multiple-Filter-Multiple-Wrapper Technique" has been proposed with improved performance of SFSW. The use of Multiple Filters with different filter metrics ensures that useful biomarkers are unlikely to be screened out in the initial filter stage. The use of Multiple Wrappers is intended to optimize the reliability of the classification by establishing consensus among several classifiers. However, in this research work, we have identified that the Classification Accuracy of MFMW is poor due to the consideration of Indecisive Prediction Status. Hence, this Research Work is introduced an efficient classifier called ICS4-MFMW, which is focusing both the dimensionality reduction and Indecisive Status. This work is demonstrated its efficiency in terms of classification accuracy with Sensitivity and Specificity. From the result, it is revealed that our proposed work perform better as compared with the existing MFMW Classifier. © 2005 - 2012 JATIT & LLS. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Notwithstanding developments in design, processing and quality control techniques, flaws in insulation of electrical power apparatus such as blow-holes, cavities, surface imperfections, etc are unavoidable. Manufacturers and utilities employ a variety of prognostic tools to assess the condition of insulation amongst which Partial Discharge (PD) measurement has become an indispensable non-intrusive technique. Since discrimination of PD is a fundamental yet an indispensable prerequisite for diagnosis and since multiple PD sources are frequently encountered in practice, such studies have grabbed the attention of researchers. In view of the fact that PD is inherently a complex non-Markovian process and a majority of modern PD measurement systems acquire data for a substantial duration, the database is large leading to a plethora of complications during classification such as ill-conditioning, over-fitting etc. Though an array of intelligent and scientific computational techniques such as Neural Networks (NN), Hidden Markov Models, Wavelet Transformation etc have been utilized for single and overlapped PD sources with a fair degree of success, the inability to develop a comprehensive and validated scheme for identification continues to be elusive. In this research, exhaustive studies have been carried out on benchmark models that replicate single and multiple PD sources with a focus on three major aspects during classification which utilizes PNN versions that employ a variety of partition based clustering techniques namely algorithms based on distance and similarity, square error and density function. The first aspect focuses on ascertaining the ability of non-clustering based PNN versions in handling large ill-conditioned datasets during training in comparison with the various partitioning based algorithms. The second is on the analysis of the ability of square-error, distance and density based clustering techniques in providing frugal sets of representative centers during training. The third facet is to ascertain the role played by the preprocessing techniques in dealing with issues related to the curse of dimensionality during classification. Further, exhaustive analysis is carried out to determine the role played by the free parameter (variance parameter) in distinguishing various classes of PD, number of iterations and its impact on computational cost during the training phase in NNs which utilize the clustering algorithms and the choice of the number of codebook vectors in classifying the patterns. © 2005 - 2012 JATIT & LLS.},

Our aim focuses on providing challengeable security without using any keys in sender and receiver sides and to fulfill the receiver faith. Vandermonde and GF^n are the two significant process involves in the encoding and decoding techniques. In this paper we use these techniques to achieve the greater extent security in message passing concept. Here we are using GF^n logarithmic operations instead of normal arithmetic operations. In our paper, we propose architecture of message passing and we examine the issues of data security. In the preliminary algorithm (i.e.) encoding scheme is done by using Vandermonde format which provides security to a greater extent and our scheme supports the GF (Galois Field) which is different from the ordinary arithmetic operation. Generally sender sends their message to receiver through some media which should be securely packed. Mostly security mechanisms are using between the message center and receiver side. Why we cannot give that security from sender side to message center? Even though security exhibits they are made up of some keys. Our Encoding scheme does not have the key to generate the operation. © 2012 EuroJournals Publishing, Inc.},

Results show that in general the accuracy of models to fit experimental data improves with the degree of freedom. To understand the mechanism involved with different types of sorbate-sorbent system as well as to find out the best fitting isotherm model, the correlation coefficients, and average percentage error and student t-test were carried out. Temkin isotherm model, Langmuir-Freundlich isotherm model and Fritz-Schlunder model as well as Baudu model were found to be the best fit models amongst the two-parametric models, three parametric models and four parametric isotherms modeling, respectively.

abstract={We propose an image segmentation algorithm that is based on unsupervised learning algorithm. This paper presents color texture segmentation using EM(Expectation Maximization) algorithm. EM(ExpectationMaximization) algorithm is an unsupervised learning algorithm for color texture segmentation based multi-resolution image fusion. First, a color texture images are decomposed of multi-resolution representation by wavelet transform, adaptive fusion weight value of wavelet coefficients are resolved using PCA, then fused images is formed by inverse transforming and combining all wavelet coefficients. Expectation Maximization (EM) is one of the most common algorithms used for density estimation of data points in an unsupervised setting. The algorithm relies on finding the maximum likelihood estimates of parameters when the data model depends on certain latent variables. In EM, alternating steps of Expectation (E) and Maximization (M) are performed iteratively till the results converge. The E step computes an expectation of the likelihood by including the latent variables as if they were observed, and maximization (M) step, which computes the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters by maximizing the expected likelihood found on the last E step. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2012.},

The free radical scavenging potential was studied in vitro by using different antioxidant models such as DPPH, super oxide scavenging activity, hydroxide scavenging activity and nitric oxide scavenging activity. Both experimental approaches not only substantiate its antioxidant potential but also the cardio-protection imparted by the extract. The cardiostimulatory effects were investigated for the extract by treating it as a pre-conditioning agent against myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury. The improved antioxidant status of the myocardium indirectly predicts reduced oxidative stress mediated by ischemic reperfusion with evident reduction of infarct size determined by cardiac marker protein. These findings indicate that DG chloroform root extract may possess therapeutic potential against ischemia reperfusion injury.},

A common single nucleotide polymorphism located within the proline rich region of TP53 gene at codon 72 in exon 4 encodes either proline or arginine. TP53 Arg 72 is more active than TP53 Pro 72 in inducing apoptosis. The aim of this study was to understand the association of the 72 codon polymorphism with acute leukemia development and prognosis. A total of 288 acute leukemia cases comprising 147 acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and 141 acute myeloid leukemia (AML), as well as 245 controls were recruited for analysis of the TP53 72 polymorphism using PCR-RFLP method. Significant association of homozygous arginine genotype with AML was observed (x2-133.53; df-2, p&lt; 0.001. When data were analyzed with respect to clinical variables, elevation in mean WBC, blast %, LDH levels and slight reduction in DFS in ALL cases with the arginine genotype was observed. In contrast, AML patients with Pro/Pro had elevated WBC, Blast%, LDH levels with slightly reduced DFS. Our study indicates that Arg/Arg genotype might confer increased risk to development of acute myeloid leukemia.},

abstract={Purpose: To develop and validate a suitable method for the assay of metformin hydrochloride (HCl) in tablets containing croscarmellose sodium as an additive. Methods: Methanol and ethanol (99%) were assessed as solvents for sample preparation for the assay of metformin HCl in tablets containing croscarmellose sodium by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and ultra violet spectrophotometric (UV) methods. The proposed method was subjected to validation tests. Results: Recovery of metformin HCl from the placebo-spiked sample was 95.1 to 96.9% as per BP and USP methods compared with 99.3 to 100.8% when analyzed by the proposed method. The use of methanol and ethanol as solvents resolved the problem of retention of metformin HCl by croscarmellose sodium in solution during the preparation of sample solution. Conclusion: The modified UV and HPLC methods are suitable for the determination of metformin HCl in tablets both in the presence and absence of croscarmellose sodium.

abstract={Closed loop variable speed operation of a Permanent Magnet Brushless DC (PMBLDC) motor drive covering transient and steady state running conditions has been investigated through extensive simulation using MATLAB/ Simulink. The simulation schematic models the full drive system fed from a 6-pulse voltage fed PWM inverter and implements a space vector based predictive current controller for independent torque and speed control. The motor operates as a prime mover coupled to a dc generator and the entire drive is modeled using a set of related electromechanical equations. Hardware implementation of the closed loop system consisting of a DSP controller and power module covering speed and current feedback was carried out and the results are presented. The results confirm the real-time capability of the controller and associated DSP program in a practical operational environment. © 2012 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.},

abstract={This paper reports the use of a GIS based Probabilistic Certainty Factor method to assess the geo-environmental factors that contribute to landslide susceptibility in Tevankarai Ar sub-watershed, Kodaikkanal. Landslide occurrences are a common phenomenon in the Tevankarai Ar sub-watershed, Kodaikkanal owing to rugged terrain at high altitude, high frequency of intense rainfall and rapidly expanding urban growth. The spatial database of the factors influencing landslides are compiled primarily from topographical maps, aerial photographs and satellite images. They are relief, slope, aspect, curvature, weathering, soil, land use, proximity to road and proximity to drainage. Certainty Factor Approach is used to study the interaction between the factors and the landslide, highlighting the importance of each factor in causing landslide. The results show that slope, aspect, soil and proximity to roads play important role in landslide susceptibility. The landslide susceptibility map is classified into five susceptible classes - low, very low, uncertain, high and very high - 93.32% of the study area falls under the stable category and 6.34% falls under the highly and very highly unstable category. The relative landslide density index (R index) is used to validate the landslide susceptibility map. R index increases with the increase in the susceptibility class. This shows that the factors selected for the study and susceptibility mapping using certainty factor are appropriate for the study area. Highly unstable zones show intense anthropogenic activities like high density settlement areas, and busy roads connecting the hill town and the plains. © Indian Academy of Sciences.},

abstract={The WiMAX mesh networks based on IEEE 802.16 standard is being implemented with the goal of establishing open, easily extensible and manageable networks for a variety of people-centric applications. As an extension of point-to-multipoint (PMP) configuration, the IEEE 802.16 mesh mode provides a quicker and more flexible approach for network deployment and administration. Multimedia networking requires quality-of-service (QoS) support, which demands promising and potential mechanisms in addition to the four service types defined in the specification. In this paper, we design a general algorithm for subscriber stations (SSs) to achieve concurrent transmission in both uplink and downlink streams. Mechanisms for constructing and making adjustment of routing trees are also given in this paper. By examining standard, centralized and distributed scheduling/routing schemes in the mesh mode from QoS aspect, a BS-controlled and delay-sensitive scheduling/routing scheme is proposed. Simulation results show that overall end-to-end throughput is greatly improved when using our algorithm for concurrency and that the algorithm performs better when the routing tree is adjusted. The average delay as well as the delay jitters per hop in the proposed scheme is lower than that of the distributed scheme and much lower than that of the centralized scheme. Furthermore, proposed mechanisms can also achieve higher throughput and generate much lesser signaling overhead, making our framework a promising one for multimedia support. © 2005 - 2012 JATIT & LLS.

abstract={A variety of drive characteristics are required in industries employing electric motors as actuators. The suitability of a particular type of motor for the application essentially depends on the required mechanical characteristic. Particularly the range of the demanded torque at the required speed range imposes considerable restrictions on the choice of the motor. The closed loop operation of a spooler drive system driven from PWM inverter fed Permanent Magnet Brushless DC [PMBLDC] motor is simulated. The controller implements a combination of space vector PWM and predictive current control for realizing the speed-torque profile. This profile requires simultaneous variation of speed and torque whose range is a function of production line settings and mechanical dimensions of the spooler drum. The controller satisfies stable running of the drive system along with twin requirements of meeting the linear production speed of a product and the need for applying a constant pulling force on the same. Accordingly the simulation covering two different products in a cable manufacturing unit where the end product has to be wound on prespecified spooler drums has been carried out. The simulation reveals the suitability of PMBLDC motor drive and the effectiveness of the controller utilizing speed and current feedback. © 2012 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.},

abstract={Ceropegia juncea Roxb (Asclepidaceae) it is found in the South Indian States of India. In folk medicine the extract of the plant is used for treatment of for the treatment of liver disorders and also in hypotension, ulcerative condition, fever, topically used as anaesthetic agent. A novel furopyridine alkaloid isolated from the plant has shown an analgesic and anti-inflammatory effect on acetic acid induced writhing in mice. The phytochemical profile of the plant reveals the presence of alkaloids, tannins, sterols, glycosides, saponins, proteins, lipids and carbohydrates. The In-vivo antioxidant and hepatoprotective activity of hydro-alcoholic extract of whole plant of Ceropegia juncea Roxb (HACJ). The In-vivo antioxidant activity was determined by estimating the tissue levels of GSH and lipid peroxidation. The degree of hepatoprotection was assessed by estimating levels of biochemical markers like SGPT, SGOT, ALP, Bilirubin (total and direct), cholesterol and HDL. 200, 400 and 600mg/kg were used to assess the protective property in paracetamol induced hepatic damage in albino rats. The HACJ produced significant effect by decreasing the activity or level of serum enzymes, bilirubin, cholesterol, HDL and tissue lipid peroxidation, while it significantly increased the levels of tissue GSH in a dose dependent manner. The effects of extract were compared with standard, silymarin at 100 mg/kg dose. These results suggested that hydro-alcoholic extract of Ceropegia juncea Roxb whole plant possesses hepatoprotective activity against paracetamol induced hepatic damage and significant antioxidant activity in rats.},

By judging the current trends in wireless technologies it can be predicted that Cognitive Radio will be a critical part of many future radio systems and networks. Cognitive Radio uses any of the three techniques - Spectrum Sensing, Spectrum Database and Cognitive Pilot Channel to acquire information about spectrum usage. Spectrum Sensing is the inherent ability of Cognitive Radio to autonomously perform required calculations and detect unused spectrum which can be used for a multitude of purposes. Due to its advantages many studies have been focussed to improve and implement Spectrum Sensing effectively in Cognitive Radio and this lead to development of many spectrum sensing schemes.

abstract={Since the introduction of public-key cryptography by Diffe and Hellman in 1976, the potential for the use of the discrete logarithm problem in public-key cryptosystems has been recognized. Although the discrete logarithm problem as first employed by Diffe and Hellman was defined explicitly as the problem of finding logarithms with respect to a generator in the multiplicative group of the integers module a prime, this idea can be extended to arbitrary groups and in particular, to elliptic curve groups. The resulting public - key systems provide relatively small block size, high speed, and high security. This paper explores an efficient performance of GF(25) in the normal basis representation and an elliptic curve cryptosystems using a non-super singular curve over the field; so this scheme is of less computation cost which is valuable in applications with limited memory, communications bandwidth or computing power. © 2005 - 2012 JATIT &amp; LLS.},

abstract={Basella alba is used in many parts of the world for its medicinal use as laxative, anti-inflammatory, rubefacient, soothing as well as its cooling effects when applied to burns and scalds. It's also used for haemorrhages, skin diseases, sexual weakness, ulcers and as laxative in children and pregnant women. In Nigeria, used for fertility enhancement in women, burn wounds etc. Hence the present study was chosen to evaluate its scientific validity. In the present study aqueous extract of leaves of Basella alba were formulated as a gel and investigated for its physicochemical as well as for its burn wound healing activity. Aqueous extract of dried leaves of Basella alba were subjected to preliminary phytochemical evaluation and wound healing activity studies. Different gel formulations of aqueous extract of Basella alba (2% w/v) were prepared using polymers carbopol 934 and carbopol 940 by varying their concentration. These formulations were evaluated for the following parameters: drug content, pH, viscosity, extrudability, spreadability, primary skin irritation, pharmacological activity and stability. Wound healing studies of aqueous extract revealed that Basella alba treated animals were found to epithelise in 23 days while the solvent control and untreated rats epithelise within 35days and 39 days respectively. The formulation 1.5% w/w carbopol 934 was found to be more promising as it shows better physicochemical characteristics, higher pharmacological activity and better stability compared to other formulations. So it was concluded that Basella alba aqueous extract shows significant improvement in burn wound contraction and hence this is a spromising candidate in burn wound healing.},

abstract={This study aimed to evaluate the protective role of ellagic acid against mitochondrial damage in beta adrenergic agonist (isoproterenol)-induced myocardial infarction in Wistar rats in order to provide a scientific basis for the use of ellagic acid in preventing myocardial infarction. Mitochondria were isolated from the heart tissue of rats from all the groups. Lipid profile, lipid peroxidation, antioxidant enzyme activities and mitochondrial enzyme activities were measured. The structure of mitochondria was analysed by transmission electron microscopy. Isoproterenol-induced rats showed a significant increase in mitochondrial lipid peroxidation products and alterations in mitochondrial lipid profile. Significant decreases in mitochondrial antioxidants and tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes were also found in the heart mitochondria of isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarcted rats. The protective effect of ellagic acid on the heart mitochondrial structure was evidenced by transmission electron microscopic study. Free radical scavenging and metal chelating activities of ellagic acid which are confirmed by in vitro studies may be the mechanism, responsible for the protective action against mitochondrial damage in myocardial infarction. The results support the importance of ellagic acid in regular diet to prevent myocardial infarction. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Manasamitra vatakam (MMV) has long been used as a traditional medicine in India for the treatment of psychosomatic diseases, anxiety neurosis, and stress. The present study was designed to examine the neuroprotective effect of MMV against aluminum (Al)-induced memory impairment and oxidative damage in rats. Neurotoxicity was induced by the administration of Al [100mg/kg body weight (b.w.) per oral (p.o.)/day] to Wistar albino rats for 90 days. Al administration induced neurotoxicity as well as oxidative stress by affecting the active avoidance and memory impairment, as well as altering antioxidants, such as HSP70 protein, superoxide dismutase, catalase, reduced glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, and acetylcholinesterase. It was observed that the administration of MMV (100mg/kg b.w./p.o./day) along with AlCl 3 improves memory performance and antioxidant activity against Al-induced neurotoxicity in rats. In conclusion, these data suggest that MMV can prevent brain damage from Al-induced neurotoxicity in rats and thus can be used as a neuroprotective agent. © 2012 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.},

abstract={The next generation of surgical adhesives that are intended for internal applications will present considerable functional and regulatory challenges compared with topical adhesives that are currently available. These new adhesives must strongly adhere to wet surfaces and remain in place until the wound is leak-proof, while not being easily monitored. As adjuncts to current technologies such as sutures, staples, and tissue glue, there is a growing interest to reduce the incidence of trauma associated with surgical incisions and suture lines. Novel approaches are under development that can facilitate wound closure without causing excessive inflammation, ischemia, or necrosis to the wound. Degradable tissue adhesive tapes have recently been suggested as a potential method for wound closure/healing. One strategy to implement this technology utilizes biomimicry to achieve high levels of adhesion by replicating the nanotopography of the gecko's footpad in biocompatible and biodegradable elastomers. Geckos can walk up vertical surfaces because the bottoms of their feet are covered with hierarchical fibrillar arrays which can maximize the interfacial adhesion to surfaces. Tissue adhesion of structures that mimic the gecko footpad can be further enhanced by applying a thin coating of a tissue-reactive biocompatible glue to the nanotopographically patterned surface. Using this two-component design, a tape-based adhesive can adapt to physiologic mechanical forces, while remaining strongly attached to the underlying tissue and eliciting minimal inflammatory response, eventually resorbing harmlessly without the damage caused by removal associated with other adhesives. These strongly adherent and minimally inflammatory biodegradable taped-based adhesives will provide a platform for many practical additions to the surgical armamentarium. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.

abstract={Putrescine (1,4-diaminobutane) a biologically active diamine has been found to be a valuable analyte for several clinical and analytical purposes. The present work deals with diamine oxidase immobilized on iron oxide nanoparticles for quantifying the amount of putrescine produced, by the decarboxylation of ornithine, which is converted into hydrogen peroxide by the enzyme diamine oxidase (DAO). This reaction can be quantified using electrochemical techniques, which forms the basis of this work. Iron oxide (Fe<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf>) nanoparticles, synthesized using thermal co-precipitation, were chosen for immobilization of DAO due to its simple preparation procedure, high surface area and cost-effectiveness. The size of the particles was in the range of 25-35 nm and the enzyme was linked covalently by carbodiimide activation and confirmed using FT-IR. For detecting the hydrogen peroxide released in the reaction, a glassy carbon-working electrode coated with enzyme linked iron oxide nanoparticles was poised at +0.4 V versus an Ag/AgCl reference electrode and a platinum wire was used as the counter electrode. A step-wise increase in current was observed and linearity was obtained in the range of 2-8 nM, with 0.65 nM as the minimum detection limit and the response time was found to be 0.3 seconds. Ascorbic acid, a common interfering molecule in biological samples, did not interfere with the measurements indicating the high degree of specificity of the diamine oxidase-based nano-interfaced biosensor. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={Plastic pollution is creating the significant environmental and economic burdens since they consume the natural fuels (energy) and other natural resources. Beside this, they have long shelf time, debasing the environment in the numerous ways. The only way to trim down the hazards of plastic pollution is to decrease the use of plastic and thereby reducing its production. Degradations and recycling steps followed to diminish these plastic was of no use since it takes abundant stress (mechanical and chemical) to do so and also considered being costly. Biodegradable plastics became major approach to solve this issue and also became eminent since 1970s. From the inventory of biopolymers acting as bioplastics, PHA has gained major importance because of its analogous behavior to that of petro based plastics. PHAs are the linear polymers produced by the microbes to store energy and carbon. Present review discusses about the PHA production method, recent advances in producing, its degradation and applications of PHA which elucidates the gaining importance in today's industrial world. © 2011 Varsha YM, et al.},

abstract={This paper proposes an idea for designing a continuously tuned adaptive PI controller for a non-linear process such as conical tank. In this paper, a simple tuning system is used to continuously tune the controller parameters in correspondence with the change in operating points. For each stable operating point, a FOPTD model was identified using process reaction curve method. The estimated model parameters are used to calculate the controller parameters for each operating points. Based on these calculated controller parameters and its operating points, a tuning system was created. The tuning system will able to interpolate and extrapolate the relation between control variable and the controller parameters over entire span of control variables. Finally, a detailed time-domain modeling of the conical tank was performed. Then the adaptive PI controller was implemented in Matlab and was simulated to verify its performance. Thus the adaptive controller was able to produce a consistent response regardless of parametric variations with minimum overshoots and minimum settling time. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={The basic aim was to clarify the whey proteins from buffalo milk using nano-pore membrane filtration. The purification involved size-exclusion principle of separating the proteins based on their nano-molecular sizes. Buffalo milk was pre-treated to obtain whey-protein isolates by removal of fat, casein and phosphates using centrifugation. The product was processed by Microfiltration membrane to remove bacteria, colloids and Lipo-proteins; Nanofiltration membrane to separate salts and Ultrafiltration membrane to clarify the whey proteins. Proteins; Glyco-Macro Peptide (GMP), Lacto-albumin (La), Lacto-globulin (Lg) and Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) were collected by the employment of 10kDa (kilo-Daltons), 30kDa, 50kDa and 100kDa respectively based mainly on the molecular weights of proteins. Each protein was confirmed by qualitative and quantitative analyses. Qualitative analysis involving Lowry's test and Bi-uret testrevealed permeate yield values corresponding to the standard concentrations of each protein in the whey. Gel-Filtration Chromatography and SDS-PAGE carried out for qualitative analysis confirmed the presence of desired proteins with regard to their respective molecular weights. Yield values for the 4 proteins were found to be satisfactory after 2 trails. Design parameterswere optimized for lab scale cascade membrane filtration process. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={The Semicircular Breakwater (SBW) is a recently emerging topic, on which researchers are focusing considerable attention on its hydrodynamic performance characteristics worldwide, particularly, in Japan and China. The SBW has a semicircular-shaped hollow caisson founded on a rubble mound. It is cast as different elements and made of prestressed concrete. Since the caisson is hollow, its weight and the materials to be used are significantly less. The stability against sliding for SBW is good, since, the horizontal component of the wave force is smaller as compared to the vertical component; in addition, the vertical component is applied downward the curved wall. The SBW enhances the scenery compared to the conventional rubble mound breakwaters. Due to high stability against the wave action, it is expected that it can also serve well as offshore-detached breakwaters adopted for the protection of the coast against erosion. The different concepts of SBW are (1) the solid type in which case, its surface is impermeable; (2) the front wave dissipating type with seaside wall facing the waves being perforated; (3) the permeable type with its seaside and leeside walls being permeable and (4) the rear wave dissipating type with its leeside along being perforated. In this review paper, the results of detailed experimental investigations conducted by the author on hydrodynamic characteristics of SBW such as dimensionless hydrodynamic pressure, wave forces, reflection and transmission characteristics for surface piercing and submerged conditions are explained. The effects of perforations, water depth and rubble mound height are also explained. © 2011 Knowledpa Review, Malaysia.},

abstract={In general, ayurvedic doctors used to examine the body by analyzing the wrist pulse of the patient. It is said that these pulse characteristics changes corresponding to the various changes in the body. For example, a tumour and a cyst will have different patterns in their pulse characteristics. Thus the wrist pulse signal is being used to analyze a person's health status. This reflects the pathologic changes of the person's body condition. Three different pulses can be located in single artery on the wrist, which will provide useful information regarding a person's health. In this project an attempt is being made to standardize the signals for normal conditions and then try to go for identifying the variation in pulse characteristics for simple abnormal conditions i.e., diabetic cases. The methodology planned is described in brief as follows: Suitable pulse sensor will be used along with necessary signal processing circuitry in order to acquire the pulse signals. Reference pulse signals will be acquired from a number of persons with normal health status. Reference signal will be subjected to a statistical analysis. Approximate Entropy, being a statistical measure is planned to be used as a quantity for the purpose of characterizing standard signals and abnormal signals. The expected deviation of the measured quantity from the reference standard quantity will be used for diagnosis. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={In light of the evolution in employer brand management practice, this paper aims to present an assessment of employer branding as an antecedent to organization commitment in varying organization environments. The presupposition is that the internal organization climate/environment of different industries (in this case manufacturing and service industry) vary considerably. The findings of the study confirm high levels of the three components of organisation commitment namely, affective commitment, continuance commitment, and normative commitment, and a very high score for employer brand. But contrary to the predictions, the inter-correlations for all the four components of the employer brand with the organizational commitment dimensions were very low. The organization climate of the manufacturing and service sector units exhibited a moderating role on the relationship between the variables.

abstract={Man toddled into a new era where huge monitors are replaced by palm size screens, and they boom alive to perform millions of activity in a millisecond!!! Seated in one place today, man can do just about anything with his portable palm size gadgets. But as the sizes of gadgets shrunk, iniquity and espionage magnified to monstrosity. Scientists over the years while devised techniques to shrink gadgets, also cerebrated algorithms to check the infraction. This paper proposes yet another method using the pixel indicator technology to increase the capacity of the message carrier; i.e. cover object. The pixel indicator is used to decide where the clandestine information has been embedded and to which colour plane of the cover image. Later how many clandestine data would be embedded on the chosen plane of the pixels is decided by the MSB of all the three planes. This proposed method also includes additional integrity check mechanism with improved randomness and hence the security. Simulation tests & complexity analysis were performed to evaluate the dexterity and complexity of the proposed algorithm. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Over the few years, adsorption has been projected as an effective wastewater treatment technology by many researchers across the globe owing to its inherent advantages. Thus, improving adsorption potential of known adsorbents is need of the hour. Power of sonication can be exploited to create fine particles with porous surface and hence enhance uptake capacity of an adsorbent. In this work, we demonstrate the application of sonication in a mixture acid medium to enhance the adsorption potential of neem sawdust. While sonic cavitations developed cracks on the surface of neem sawdust, mixture acid removed lignin and pectin from neem sawdust making it amenable to sonication. Changes in morphology and particle size distribution achieved due to sonication were confirmed with SEM and PSD respectively. Nickel adsorption capacities of neem Azadirachta indica sawdust samples with and without sonic treatment were estimated at various levels of initial nickel concentrations. The paired t confidence interval and test procedures were employed to determine if the mean difference between the paired observations was different from zero. The 95% confidence interval (-8.42,-5.4) confirm that the mean difference between the uptake capacities of two sawdust samples was different from zero. Apart from this, Langmuir monolayer adsorption potential of neem sawdust was found to be 13.92 and 22.76 mg/g before and after sonication respectively. This confirms that sawdust adsorption capacity of neem sawdust increased by 63.39% after sonication in mixture acid medium. © EM International.},

In this paper, we are going to overlay real still images of landmark with virtual computer graphical images. These SFM techniques which have been discussed earlier in some of the previous papers will not work in real time applications because of its high cost.

abstract={In power system, the nonlinear load affects the power quality such as harmonics of the supply system. In this paper, the diode rectifier is used as load which distorts the supply current. This supply current harmonics are reduced by the Shunt active filter (SAF) which injects the harmonic current to the load. So supply is free from harmonics. The synchronous reference frame theory is used to extract the fundamental component of the supply current which is the reference current for the hysteresis controller. The hysteresis controller tunes the SAF so that it generates the current equal in magnitude and opposite in phase with the nonlinear load. So the total harmonic distortion (THD) of supply current is greatly reduced. In this paper the SAF dc bus voltage is maintained constant using PI / PID controller and time domain specification of the bus voltage is analyzed using Matlab simulink and the results are presented. © 2011 IEEE.},

This heuristic approach is tested for 33 benchmark problems taken from OR library of sizes upto 7000, and the results have been compared with optimum solutions. Computational complexity is proved to be O (klmn 2) of solving heuristically MMKP using this approach. The performance of our heuristic is compared with the best state-of-art heuristic algorithms with respect to the quality of the solutions found. The encouraging results especially for relatively large-size test problems indicate that this heuristic approach can successfully be used for finding good solutions for highly constrained NP-hard problems.

abstract={Venoms from elapidae snakes are rich sources of over 100 protein toxins and most of them have been grouped into six superfamilies. Of the six superfamilies, three-finger toxin (3FTx) family contains most toxic principles such as cardiotoxins and α-neurotoxins. The proteins belonging to these two members of 3FTx superfamily are highly similar in their primary, secondary and tertiary structures. Notwithstanding their extreme structural similarities, they are drastically differing from each other in their biological functions. Thus, authentic functional assays are prerequisites for unambiguously annotating these protein toxins and the assays demand highly pure protein samples, sound experimental knowledge and sophisticated instrumentations. In these backgrounds, we have developed a computational tool, TFTX, which identifies cardiotoxins and α-neurotoxins on the basis of their primary structures. The robustness of the tool has been validated using authentic sequences of cardiotoxins and α-neurotoxins eported in the literature. Moreover, the TFTX is powerful to differentiate cardiotoxins and α-neurotoxins of snake venoms from the three-finger proteins of various organisms that are not toxic in nature. The uniqueness of the TFTX has also been dealt through a comparative analysis of the tool with existing computational means such as 'NTXpred server', 'SUPERFAMILY server' and 'phylogenetic methods' for the structural classifications. The program is publicly available through the web server at http://feat.sastra.edu/TFTX.html.},

abstract={Diazepam possesses potent anti-epileptic, anti-anxiety activity and also indicated for the treatment of insomnia. It is very slightly soluble in water and shows poor dissolution. Presently, liquisolid compact technique is found to be used extensively as one of the successful tool to enhance the solubility and dissolution of various poorly soluble drugs. The principle focus of this study is to formulate Liquisolid compacts of Diazepam to enhance its dissolution rate. Here, liquisolid compacts are fabricated using different non-volatile solvents and converting them into acceptably flowing and compressible powders for efficient compact tablet production. The solubility studies are carried by dispersing the drug in various dissolution enhancing agents (non- volatile solvents) such as Polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG-400), Polyethylene glycol 600 (PEG-600), Propylene glycol, Tween 80, Span 80 and Glycerol. The drug solubility is comparatively high in PEG-600, which is selected as suitable vehicle for the formulation and its further study. The formulations are made by using different ratios of Drug and PEG-600, then by the addition of diluents like manitol, microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel pH-101) and lactose as carrier materials and other excipients to optimize the direct compression process. The prepared blends are subjected to the pre-formulation studies and the compressed liquisolid compacts are evaluated for the physical parameters such as uniformity of weight, hardness, diameter, thickness, friability, disintegrention, content uniformity and in-vitro dissolution. The FTIR and DSC analysis are performed to confirm the compatibility and stability of the drug with the excipients.},

abstract={The aim of this study is to analyze the hotel guests' expectations and perceptions of hotel services and the role of demographic variables in evaluating the Service quality and also to ascertain how Factor analysis can be used to identify number of factors underlying SERVQUAL components (items). Statistical methods like descriptive analysis, reliability analysis, multiple regressions and exploratory factor analysis were used to evaluate the service quality. The findings of the research showed that with regard to individual SERVQUAL dimensions, gap values are positive for tangibles, reliability, assurance and gap values are negative for responsiveness and empathy. With regard to Factor analysis, data on hotel guests' perceptions divided SERVQUAL items into four main factors, with Eigen values greater than 1.0 and data on expectations divided SERVQUAL items into three main factors, with Eigen values greater than 1.0.It is recommended to the managers' of the hotels to understand the expectations of their guests' and make their service personnel to respond as per their guests' expectations and also to be compassionate enough to serve their guests' appropriately. Managers can utilize the guests' feedback to understand their perception towards the various hospitality aspects of the hotels. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.},

abstract={Radio over Fiber refers to a technology whereby light is modulated by a radio signal and transmitted over an optical fiber link to facilitate wireless access. The present work purports to the modeling of radio over fiber systems in the MATLAB environment on employing specially designed photonic crystal fibers, consisting of subwavelength-core dielectric photonic nanowires embedded in their cladding, as optical channels between the main central station and the set of base stations and silicon photonic based electro-optic modulators. Data transmission at terahertz frequencies using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing schemes with cyclic error control coding along with digital modulation schemes such as amplitude shift keying and binary phase shift keying have been implemented. Different carrier signals such as solitons, similaritons, square, and sine waves are considered. In simulating the radio over fiber system, three different media are considered. In the first stage of signal propagation, photonic crystal fibers embedded with photonic nanowires in their cladding are considered and signal propagation through them is numerically modeled using the predictor-corrector symmetrized split step Fourier method. In the second stage, electrical transmission lines that are modeled as microstrips using S-parameters are considered. In the last stage of signal propagation, wireless channel modeled using additive white Gaussian noise and multipath fading, is considered. The performance of the aforementioned communication system is reviewed using standard metrics such as bit error rate and eye diagrams. It is shown that solitons are more robust carriers for terahertz communications compared to the other carriers and that it is possible to achieve a relatively distortion free communication system even amidst the worst possible SNR levels. © 2011 IEEE.},

The rotor resistance changes significantly during operation due to temperature rise. This variation has a major influence on the field oriented control performance of an induction motor drive due to the deviation of slip frequency from the set value. The MRAS approach using reactive power as a functional candidate for rotor resistance estimation makes it computationally simpler, easy to design. Rotor resistance estimation using reactive power completely eliminates the need of flux estimation. Thus, this method is less sensitive to integrator related problems. The performance of vector controlled induction motor drive with the MRAS based rotor resistance estimator is simulated in MATLAB/SIMULINK. The promising results obtained are presented. © 2011 IEEE.},

Identifying weld defects using human eye is almost impossible, since the radio-graphic images will be very dark and low in contrast. Image segmentation is the process of identifying objects from the images using mathematical concepts which is a time consuming and tough task. Defects or discontinuation in welding occurs due to various reasons such as gas entrapment, lack of penetration, too much heat, oxide inclusion, etc. This paper, we performed Watershed, Hough Transform and Region Growing segmentation.

abstract={Background: Recently man has started depending on natural resources even for his healthcare. Problems with drug resistant microorganisms, side effects of the modern medicine and the increasing number of emerging diseases for which no cure is available in modern medicine has renewed the interest in plants as a significant source of therapeutics. Primary Study Objective: Liver is a versatile organ that regulates the internal environment of the body and hence becomes prone to toxicity. Despite the tremendous strides in modern medicine there is still a need for a drug that stimulates liver function. Hence the present study focuses on the study of the hepatoprotective potentials of Ocimum sanctum Linn. in lead induced toxicity. Methods and Design: Aqueous extract of O. sanctum was prepared as per protocol. Wistar strains of Albino rats were used as the experimental models. Animals were grouped into six comprising of six rats each. Hepatotoxicity was induced using lead. The selected plant drug was administered to the animals orally for a period of 21 days. The Hepatic serum markers AST, ALT, ALP, GGT, Serum Protein, Serum Bilirubin and Tissue Glycogen were analyzed. The antioxidant status of the animals was also assessed in the animals by measuring the activity of GSH and SOD. The extent of lipid per oxidation (LPO) was also measured. Results: The results obtained depicted the protective nature of the selected drug source. The induction of liver injury with lead resulted in significant raise in the serum marker enzyme level along with an increase in the serum bilirubin content. The inactivation of the liver was evident from the lowered levels of serum protein and tissue glycogen levels. The antioxidant status was very low thus causing an accumulation in lipid peroxides in the hepatic tissues. All the parameters studied were restored to near normal when treated with the aqueous extract of O. sanctum. Values, p<0.05 were considered statistically significant. Conclusion: The present study clearly depicts the hepatoprotective nature of O.sanctum in lead induced toxicity. The protective activity may be attributed to the antioxidant activity of the plant.},

abstract={Landslide is a common natural hazard that usually occurs in mountainous areas. Rapid urban development and high traffic intensity movements have been hampered to a great extent by phenomenon of landslides. In Ghat section, vertical cuttings and steep slopes are induced slope failures. An assessment of landslide hazards is therefore a prerequisite for sustainable development of the hilly region. In the present study, Macro Landslide Hazard Zonation was carried out in the Bodi - Bodimettu ghats section, Western Ghats, Theni district. The slope spreads over an area of about 10.09 sq km encompassing Puliuttu Ar. sub-watershed. The study was made with help of different types of data including Survey of India topographic map, geology map, important inherent factors like lithology, structure, slope morphometry, relative relief, land use/land cover and hydrogeological conditions using Bureau of Indian Standard (BSI 14496 (Part 2):1998) and related thematic maps. Based on the thematic layers, landslide hazard evaluation factor (LHEF) and total estimated hazard (TEHD) were calculated and the macro hazard zonation map was prepared. Landslide Hazard Zonation (LHZ) of the terrain shows that out of 17 facets, facets 1 to 5 and 8 falls under Moderate Hazard zone category and facets 6, 7 and 9 to 17 under the High Hazard zone category. The field study with further analysis for hazard concluded that about 68% of the total area falls in the high hazard zone. © 2011 Indian Society of Remote Sensing.},

abstract={A new LC-MS/MS method was developed for the estimation of itraconazole, a weak UV absorbing drug, in rat plasma using verapamil as the internal standard. Chromatographic separation was achieved on an Agilent Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C 18 column (50mm × 4.6mm, 1.8) as a stationary phase. A mixture of methanol-10 Mm ammonium formate pH 4.0 (90:10, v/v) was used as a mobile phase. Plasma samples were extracted with a mixture of diethyl ether and di-chloromethane (80:20, v/v) followed by subsequent reconstitution in the mobile phase. Treated plasma samples were analyzed by electrospray ionization method in selective reaction monitoring (SRM) mode in tandem mass spectrometry. The separated products were identified by characteristic peaks and specific fragment peaks at m/z 705.3 to 392 and m/z 455 to 149.8 for itraconazole and verapamil, respectively. The present method was found to be linear in the concentration range of 0.5 to 600ng/mL for itraconazole. Pharmacokinetic study was performed after an oral administration of 30mg/kg of itraconazole to Wistar rats. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={A simple, accurate and precise chemometrics assisted UV-visible Spectrophotometric determination of triple combination commercial preparation containing ramipril (RA), aspirin (AS) and atorvastatin calcium (AT) has been proposed. The spectra of the component mixtures under investigation show substantial overlap. Resolution of the mixtures under investigation has been accomplished mainly by using one of the chemometrics methods, classical least squares regression method (CLS). CLS method does not need prior graphical treatment of the overlapping spectra of the three drugs in a mixture. Here wavelength selection is done by trial and error method. For chemometric calibrations a concentration set of the mixture consisting of the three drugs in methanol was prepared. The absorbance data were measured in the range of 210 - 340 nm at an interval of 0.1 nm. The CLS method uses 1.0 - 5.0, 10.0 - 50.0 and 2.0 - 10.0 μgmL -1 of ramipril, aspirin and atorvastatin calcium respectively for calibration. The developed calibrations were tested for the synthetic mixtures (prediction set) consisting of three drugs and the proposed method was successfully applied for the determination of the three drugs in commercial formulation. The results obtained were of high accuracy and without interference from commonly encountered excipients and additives, this is evident from the statistical validation results. Good recoveries were obtained with both synthetic mixtures and commercial formulation. Therefore this method can be routinely used in the analysis of the said combination in quality control laboratories. © RJPT All right reserved.},

abstract={A noninvasive optical method for determining the optical properties of normal and cancerous breast tissues by interpolating wavelet approach using the characteristics of nanoscale FinFET sensor has been theoretically developed and presented in this paper. This novel approach classifies the normal and cancerous tissues of human breast by calculating the surface potential variations of nanoscale FinFET illuminated by laser source of different wavelengths. Using these surface potential variations, the optical properties of the tissues are determined. By using this method, the point-to-point variations in tissue composition and structural variations in healthy and diseased tissues could be identified.

abstract={The Incorporation of deregulation and increase in renewable sources of generation has shifted the nature of existing power systems to a more geographically distributed system. This had led to significant challenges towards on-line monitoring and control. Contingency set identification is an essential step in monitoring the power system security level. Multiple contingency analysis forms the basis of security issues, particularly of large, interconnected power systems. The difficulty of multiple contingency selections for on-line security analysis lies in its inherent combinatorial nature. In this paper, an approach for identification of power system vulnerability to avoid catastrophic failures is put forward, as a multi objective optimization problem that partitions its topology graph, accounts for maximizing the imbalance between generation and load in each island and at the same time minimizes the number of lines cut to realize the partitions. The Nondominated Sorted Genetic Algorithm, version II (NSGA II) has been applied to obtain the optimal solutions and the methodology involved has been applied to an IEEE 30 bus test system and results are presented. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={The aim of this study is to investigate the mechanism of an action of compound isolated from Vitex negundo in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. Light microscopic examination of liver, kidney and pancreatic sections of streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice showed changes like coarsening of acinar cells of endoplasmic reticulum, destruction of β-cells, and alteration in their secretory function were observed in the pancreas. Changes like dilation of vein, unusual concentric arrangement of hepatocytes, and liver fibrosis were observed in the liver. Thickening of tubules and expansion of glomerulus were observed in kidneys. All these altered parameters were reversed close to normal condition upon treatment using idopyranose. The results show the antidiabetic potential of idopyranose. Interestingly, liver, kidney, and pancreatic sections of diabetic mice fed with the isolated 1, 2 di-substituted idopyranose showed regeneration of hepatocytes, nephrocytes, as well as β-cells and acinar region appeared normal with increased numbers of β-cells. To understand the probable mechanism of action of 1, 2 di-substituted idopyranose, we analyzed proinflammatory inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) expression by immunohistochemistry and the results showed an increased iNOS and NF-κB levels in streptozotocin-induced diabetic liver, kidney and pancreas. Such high iNOS and NF-κB levels were inhibited in 1, 2 di-substituted idopyranose treated mice. The results suggest that 1, 2 di-substituted idopyranose helps in the protection of hepatocytes, nephrocytes and pancreatic b-cells probably by its action against NF-κB and iNOS mediated inflammation in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract={Controlled drug delivery systems designed to deliver drug, at predetermined rates for predefined periods of time, have been used to overcome the shortcoming of conventional drug formulations. Among the microparticulate system, microspheres have a special importance to target drugs and provide controlled release. Aceclofenac is a potent non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent, and is widely used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. Aceclofenac is administered in dose of 100mg 2-3 times daily, which leads to fluctuation in the drug blood level and dose related adverse effects. Multiple dosing also often results in poor compliance and inefficient therapy. Formulations of Aceclofenac microsphere prepared by suspension cross-linking method using albumin as polymer to prevent the gastric irritation and to achieve oral sustained/controlled release of the drug. Preformulation studies revealed that the drug Aceclofenac and the polymer albumin were satisfactorily compatible without any change in the chemical nature of the drug. In present study two formulations were formulated by using bovine serum albumin. The formulations were subjected to various evaluation parameters like % practical yield, actual drug content, entrapment efficiencies, particle size distribution and in-vitro release studies. The results of all parameters are tabulated and depicted graphically in the results and discussion section. The advantages of such controlled release formulations containing non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) over the conventional dosage forms have been reported. Such formulations minimize the gastric irritant side effects of the conventional NSAID preparations.},

abstract={To develop a suitable formulation with high entrapment efficiency, etoposide-loaded poly(lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticles (NPs) were formulated by single emulsion-solvent evaporation method by changing different formulation parameters such as drug loading, choice of organic solvent and percentage of emulsifier polyvinyl alcohol. The NPs showed higher entrapment efficiency, ~86% (with 15% (w/w) drug loading). The physicochemical parameters revealed smooth topology with size range (240-320 nm), a negative zeta potential (~19 mV) and in vitro sustained-release activity (~60% drug release in 40 days). Greater anti-proliferative activity ~100 times was observed with NPs (IC50 = 0. 002 μg/ml) than that of native etoposide (IC50 = 0. 2 μg/ml) in retinoblastoma cell line (Y-79). These NPs demonstrated greater (G1/S) blocking and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential as measured by flow cytometry. There was upregulation of apoptotic gene activity in NPs than native etoposide, as revealed through microarray analysis. However, this is the first ever report demonstrating the intricate modulation of genetic network affected by NPs. Collectively, these results suggest that etoposide-loaded NPs could be potentially useful as a novel drug delivery system for retinoblastoma in the future. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Three-dimensional domain swapping is a unique protein structural phenomenon where two or more protein chains in a protein oligomer share a common structural segment between individual chains. This phenomenon is observed in an array of protein structures in oligomeric conformation. Protein structures in swapped conformations perform diverse functional roles and are also associated with deposition diseases in humans. We have performed in-depth literature curation and structural bioinformatics analyses to develop an integrated knowledgebase of proteins involved in 3D domain swapping. The hallmark of 3D domain swapping is the presence of distinct structural segments such as the hinge and swapped regions. We have curated the literature to delineate the boundaries of these regions. In addition, we have defined several new concepts like 'secondary major interface' to represent the interface properties arising as a result of 3D domain swapping, and a new quantitative measure for the 'extent of swapping' in structures. The catalog of proteins reported in 3DSwap knowledgebase has been generated using an integrated structural bioinformatics workflow of database searches, literature curation, by structure visualization and sequence-structure-function analyses. The current version of the 3DSwap knowledgebase reports 293 protein structures, the analysis of such a compendium of protein structures will further the understanding molecular factors driving 3D domain swapping. © The Author(s) 2011.},

abstract={Abstract The ameliorative role of curcumin in attenuating gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity has been reported earlier however, the mechanism of action remains unclear. Gentamicin was injected intraperitoneally (100 mg/kg body weight) once daily for 6 days. Curcumin was administered orally (200 mg/kg body weight) once daily for 7, 15 and 30 days. Gentamicin-induced rats showed significant increase in the levels of kidney markers and the activities of urinary marker enzymes, which was reversed upon curcumin treatment. A significant increase in kidney lipid peroxidation (LPO) and decrease in activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and reduced glutathione (GSH) were observed in gentamicin-induced rats. Immunohistochemical, Western blot and RT-PCR studies in gentamicin-induced rats also demonstrated an increase in the levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). All these effects induced by gentamicin were reduced upon treatment with curcumin in a time dependent manner. To conclude, curcumin enhances antioxidants, and decreases iNOS and NF-κB, thereby protecting the cells against oxidative stress induced by gentamicin. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Software reliability assessment is an area of prime importance of today, more so since computers have pervaded to practically all aspects of our lives. Moreover many software based commercial and governmental systems require very high mission reliability. To meet this, both the hardware as well as the software has to be extremely reliable. Software reliability is known to improve with the amount of testing efforts invested, which in turn leverages the cost of software development and in turn system cost. Constructing systems employing redundant inferior units that are relatively cheap is a well known alternative. Using the N-version programming paradigm, the same can be applied to software, but the cost factor becomes a major issue. The degree of redundancy employed affects reliability favorably, while increasing the cost of software design and development. In this paper, an approach to enumerate the optimal redundancy for software systems has been explored and a binary integer programming solution for the same has been presented. The methodology has been applied to the case study of a computer relay software that is employed for fault handling in power system transmission lines. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={In molecular biology, in silico identification of eukaryotic promoters is a challenging task. Currently available classifiers generate either poor sensitivity or specificity. In this paper, we propose a support vector machine classifier, referred to as PSVM, to recognize the human pol.II promoters using markov model for extracting features representing k-mer frequency, along with features representing other transcription signals such as TATA box, GC box etc. This classifier is trained using data set comprising 1862 promoters and 1759 non promoters in human genome and takes only 12 parameters to classify a given sequence as promoter or not. Among the 20 verified promoters in human chromosome 22, PSVM recognizes 18. Also it successfully identifies all the 14 well annotated exons of human chromosome 22 as non promoters. When 90% of data is used to train PSVM, it yields a sensitivity of 93.55% and specificity of 98.86% which are significantly better than previously reported results and also those of online promoter prediction tools such as NNPP, ProScan, and TSSG. Thus, k-mer frequency represented by markov model of order k, TATA box, GC box, CAAT box, Init box, and CpG island can be a valuable combination of features for predicting eukaryotic pol.II promoters. © 2011 IEEE.},

For each, the inclusion of amines in the CDPA matrix led to blue shifts in the solid state luminescence. 1 forms a CH3CN-selective, luminescent host and exhibits solvent dependent luminescent changes in the solid state. Crystallisation of CDPA-DMAP from EtOAc (2a) and CH3CN (2b) produces two different solid forms which exhibit slight differences in luminescence (λmax at 522 nm and 529 nm, respectively). The chiral luminescent host system (3a) obtained from CH3CN shows robust, reversible CH3CN-selective luminescent sensing (λ max at 523 nm (with CH3CN) and 553 nm (without CH 3CN)). In this case the luminescence changes with the crystallising solvent (MeOH (3b) and EtOH (3c)). © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011.},

abstract={Design of the various pavement layers is very much dependent on the strength of the sub-grade soil over which they are going to be laid. Sub-grade strength is mostly expressed in terms of CBR (California Bearing Ratio). Weaker sub-grade essentially requires thicker layers whereas stronger sub-grade goes well with thinner pavement layers. The pavement and the sub-grade mutually must sustain the traffic volume. The Indian Road Congress (IRC) encodes the exact design strategies of the pavement layers based upon the sub-grade strength which is primarily dependant on CBR value for a laboratory or field sample. For an engineer, it is always important to focus on optimal design of thickness of pavement which fulfills both strength and economy criteria. The strength of soil can be improved by suitably adding stabilizing agent resulting reduction in thickness of layer. Hence in the present study, three different soils with four different dosages for 2 and 4 weeks of period after application of bio-enzyme on its strength parameters were studied. It is inferred from the results that addition of bioenzyme significantly improve UCC and CBR values of selected samples. © Medwell Journals, 2011.},

abstract={Corrosion of steel reinforcement in concrete structures is caused principally by carbon-dioxide, de-icing salts and seawater and is a multi-billion pound problem worldwide. A radically new method which has recently been evolved out is the use of Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) re-bar as a substitute for conventional steel reinforcement. FRP re-bar are typically made up of either with aramid, glass or carbon fibers embedded in resin such as vinyl ester, polyester or epoxy. Since, the constituents of FRP re-bar are non-metallic, corrosion problem does not arise. Use of FRP re-bar as reinforcement has gained numerous advantages compared to the conventional reinforcement. Hence, an attempt has been made to study the effect of high strength flexural member reinforced with Glass Fiber Reinforce Polymer (GFRP) re-bar. In the present research, two high strength concrete beams of size 125×200×2100 mm have been considered. The concrete grade used is M 40. One beam is reinforced with GFRP re-bar and the other is with steel. Two point loading test was carried out and the failure characteristics were studied. The plots showing load-deflection curves at different sections of the beams and the moment carrying capacity were also developed. Thus, the study provides a clear picture of the performance of flexural member reinforced with GFRP re-bar and also provides a clear comparison with steel reinforced beam. © Medwell Journals, 2011.},

abstract={The mechanism of membrane interactions of most of the flavonoids in the presence of transition-metal ions is not well-understood. To understand this phenomenon, the present work aims to synthesize a chrysin-copper complex at room temperature and investigate its influence on the electrical characteristics of planar lipid bilayers. The chrysin-copper complex was characterized by various spectroscopic techniques and was found to have a metal/ligand ratio of 1:2 and of cationic nature. Its ability to inhibit 1,1′-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radicals was not significant at alkaline pH because of the involvement of the 5-hydroxy group in coordination with the copper ion compared to its parent flavonoid, chrysin (p &lt; 0.05). The addition of different concentrations (20-100 μM) of chrysin and the chrysin-copper complex to lipid bilayers decreases the resistance, indicating a strong surface interaction and partial insertion into the bilayer near the lipid-water interface. The dose-dependent reduction in resistance as a result of the chrysin-copper complex is more pronounced in comparison to chrysin, implying that the bulkier and charged chrysin-copper complex displays greater ability to distort the lipid bilayer architecture. These conclusions were further confirmed by curcumin-loaded liposome permeabilization studies, where both chrysin and its Cu II complex increased the fluidity in a dose-dependent manner. However, the extent of fluidization by the chrysin-copper complex was nearly twice that of chrysin alone (p &lt; 0.05). The implications of these surface interactions of chrysin and its copper complex on cell membranes were studied using a hypotonic hemolysis assay. Our results demonstrate that, at low concentrations (20 μM), the chrysin-copper complex exhibited twice the protection against hypotonic stress-induced membrane disruption when compared to chrysin. However, this stabilizing effect gradually decreased and became comparable to chrysin at higher concentrations. This biphasic behavior of the chrysin-copper complex could further be explored for therapeutic applications. © 2011 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Liver,the most complex metabolic organ in human body is continuously exposed to various pathogenic oraganisms, xenobiotic agents,drugs and subjected to metabolic stresses.

abstract={Biodiesel produced from cottonseed oil is quite a promising alternative fuel for diesel engines. Use of vegetable oils in diesel engines leads to slightly inferior performance and higher smoke emissions due to their high viscosity and carbon residue. But the performance of vegetable oils can be improved by modifying them through the transesterification process. The research work discusses the performance, combustion and emission characteristics of a single cylinder direct injection diesel engine run by using biodiesel, which was obtained from various vegetable oils like pungam oil, rice bran oil, cotton seed oil and tamanu oil. Those characteristics were compared with diesel fuel. The experimental investigations were carried out in a single cylinder water-cooled, direct injection diesel engine. The crank angle encoder measured the engine speed; the piezo electric sensors measured the cylinder pressure and the fuel injection pressure. This research work aims on the effective use of biodiesel in the diesel engine without modifying any engine specification. © 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

It addresses the strength of Modified Genetic Search algorithm combined with the Artificial Neural Network (ANN). In this work dynamic Backpropagation Neural Network is used. For training purpose, dynamic learning rate is used that causes the learning rate to decrease in subsequent epoch. The combined MGSA-ANN is used for the classification of diabetes patients to identify positive and negative cases. It also discusses the main findings and concludes with promising result of the proposed model.

abstract={Mesoporous silica has attracted attention in recent years due to its high surface area, tunable ordered narrow pores and easily modifiable functional groups. In the present work, iron oxide nanoparticles (Fe2O 3) were incorporated into the pores and surface of mesoporous SBA-15 (Santa Barbara Amorphous) via a thermal pre-synthesis method. The textural and surface properties were characterized using electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and nitrogen adsorption-desorption analysis. Due to a reduction in thermal pressure during the synthesis, the textural property of the magnetic silica remained highly ordered. The superparamagnetic property of the synthesized material was confirmed using SQUID-VSM. Cell viability studies were carried out with MC3T3 fibroblast cell lines in the presence and absence of magnetic silica and our results showed no significant change in the cell viability between the concentration range of 31.3 μg mL-1 and 250 μg mL-1. The magnetic resonance properties of the iron oxide doped mesoporous silica was determined using MRI and showed excellent longitudinal (R1) and transverse relaxivities (R2) with an R 2/R1 ratio close to 1, indicating the potential of this material as a magnetic contrast agent. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={Background: To specifically deliver paclitaxel (PTX) to retinoblastoma (RB) cells, the anionic surface-charged poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) NPs loaded with paclitaxel were conjugated with epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) antibody for enhancing site-specific intracellular delivery of paclitaxel against EpCAM overexpressing RB cells. Methods: PTX-loaded PLGA NPs were prepared by the oil-in-water single emulsion solvent evaporation method, and the PTX content in NPs was estimated by the reverse phase isocratic mode of high performance liquid chromatography. Ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl] carbodiimide hydrochloride/N-hydroxysuccinimide chemistry was employed for the covalent attachment of monoclonal EpCAM antibody onto the NP surface. In vitro cytotoxicity of native PTX, unconjugated PTX-loaded NPs (PTX-NPs), and EpCAM antibody-conjugated PTX-loaded nanoparticles (PTX-NPEpCAM) were evaluated on a Y79 RB cell line by a dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, while cellular apoptosis, cysteinyl-aspartic acid protease (caspase)-3 activation, Poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage, and cell-cycle arrest were quantified by flow cytometry. By employing flow cytometry and fluorescence image analyses, the extent of cellular uptake was comparatively evaluated. Results: PTX-NP-EpCAM had superior antiproliferation activity, increased arrested cell population at the G2-M phase, and increased activation of caspase-3, followed by PARP cleavage in parallel with the induction of apoptosis. Increased uptake of PTX-Np-EpCAM by the cells suggests that they were mainly taken up through EpCAM mediated endocytosis. Conclusions: EpCAM antibody-functionalized biodegradable NPs for tumor-selective drug delivery and overcoming drug resistance could be an efficient therapeutic strategy for retinoblastoma treatment. © 2011 Molecular Vision.},

abstract={The study of communication security includes not just encryption but also traffic security, whose essence lies in "Information Hiding". The security of an image can be enhanced by cleverly embedding data without affecting its quality. This can be done by using information hiding techniques like steganography and cryptography. Combining steganography with cryptography becomes an essential facet for secure communication. In present study, enhanced image quality and security is obtained by consorting pixel indicator technique with PVD technique. Here, the raw data is first encrypted to get two different forms of message Tl and T2 using two distinct keys Kl, K2 which is done by using encryption algorithms. As two encrypted messages can be embedded in this process, we have to first extract and then decrypt the message to retrieve the original data. The enhanced level of security is defined by the fact that even if one retrieves the message from the image it's still incomprehensible to get the original message without the two keys Kl and K2. © 2011 Asain Network for Scientific Information.},

If the complete mixture of natural amino acids is added to the basal medium, the accumulation of toxins increases, while Staphylococcus aureus was unable to produce toxins in an amino acid deprived medium. Present study suggests that the phenylalnine in all cases inhibits toxin production whereas methionine and serine reduces the biofilm disposition in Staphylococcuss aureus. Employing chemically modified medium with certain amino acids to scrutinize mechanisms of pathogenesis gives rise to the impending for additional clinical benefits beyond providing new insights in this medically pertinent field of study. It is desirable that using biostable peptides that target virulence pathways instead of microbial viability will reduces the chance of adaptability of a pathogen and therefore reduces the chance of resistance developing to a treatment.},

abstract={Minimizing the total active power loss and voltage drop are the two important challenges for power transmission and distribution in an unbalanced power flow problem for any power distribution system. This can be achieved by installing the proper sized switching capacitor at proper place in a power distribution system. This paper deals with the design of distributed power systems and optimal switching capacitor placements based on the Fuzzy-Extreme Learning Machine (FELM). The intelligent power automation system requires fast determination of site and size of the switchable capacitors in the system bus through the centralized control units based on the system load. But in case of conventional, ANN and other models available on the literature they are time consuming and less performing under a dynamic environment. To overcome this problem, we propose FELM mechanism to obtain an optimal switching capacitor placement in power distributed system. Fuzzy logic and its inference systems are used in ELM and the resultant FELM is to be used to find the site and size dynamically. Finally, the results are compared with a standard 34-bus test system with other models, with respect to the capacitor placement on the networks, savings and the computational time. © 2011 IEEE.},

In safety profile LD 50 value was determined by carrying out an acute toxicity study. In efficacy profile, the analgesic activity was evaluated by both hot plate and tail immersion tests. The anti-inflammatory activity was assessed by carrageenan-induced paw edema and anti-arthritic effect by complete Freund's adjuvant induced arthritis. Phytochemical screening of different CE extracts and quantitative analysis of both raw herb and 85% methanolic extract have been also carried out. The methanolic extract displayed analgesic activity by increasing the response time in both hot plate and tail immersion method. Extract exhibited 23.19% of anti-inflammatory activity and 33.59% of anti-arthritic effect in complete Freund's adjuvant induced paw edema. The CE extract increased the antioxidant level, along with a decrease of the in oxidative stress developed by complete Freund's adjuvant induced arthritis. In conclusion, CE is a rich source of phytochemicals with analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities.},

abstract={With the advent of the Internet, the great big world has but shrunk into a single global village. Resources, millions of them, are just a click away from any user, wherever one may be present physically. With this great luxury also come the shades of grey too. Plagiarism is one such, which is being rampant in the present days to a very high degree. In this paper, we present a study of three techniques, namely Jaccard Similarity (JS), Cosine Similarity (CS) and Jaccard Similarity with Shingles, with respect to source code plagiarism and compare the various results obtained. We have proposed a novel technique in which JS and CS are applied on the generated tokens from the parsed file, rather on the file directly. This helps in the fact that the files aren't considered just as plain text. © 2011 EuroJournals Publishing, Inc.},

abstract={The present study is aimed at to investigate the antitumor and antioxidant potentials of the ethanolic extract of Premna integrifolia Linn. (EEPI) on Ehrlich Ascites Carcinoma cell lines. Tumor was induced intraperitoneally using Ehrlich Ascites Carcinoma cells (1×10 6 cells/mouse). Ethanolic extract of Premna integrifolia Linn was administered at the dose level of 100 &amp; 200 mg/kg.bw./day for 14 days to the experimental animals after 24h of tumor inoculation. The antitumor effect of EEPI was accessed by studying the parameters such as Tumor volume, PCV, viable and non-viable cell counts, life span, Hematological and Glycoprotein profiles. Administration of EEPI decreased the Ascites fluid volume, PCV and Viable cell counts and increased the mean survival time of tumor bearing animals. The EEPI brought back the altered levels of hematological parameters, and glycoprotein levels in dose dependent manner in EAC bearing mice. The results obtained were comparable with the standard drug 5-Flurouracil (20mg/kg.bw.). The data of the results of the present study depicted that altered levels of Glycoprotein content and hematological parameters due to EAC induction were brought back to near normal values after oral administration of ethanolic extract of Premna integrifolia Linn.},

abstract={Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV), a biodegradable polyester, was electrospun to form defect-free fibers with high surface-area-to-volume ratio for skin regeneration. Several parameters such as solvent ratio, polymer concentration, applied voltage, flow rate, and tip-to-target distance were optimized to achieve defect-free morphology. The average diameter of the PHBV fibers was 724 ± 91 nm. PHBV was also solvent-cast to form 2-D films, and its mechanical properties, porosity, and degradation rates were compared with PHBV fibers. Our results demonstrate that PHBV fibers exhibited higher porosity, increased ductility, and faster degradation rate when compared with PHBV 2-D films (p < 0.05). In vitro studies with PHBV fibers and 2-D films were carried out to evaluate the adhesion, viability, proliferation, and gene expression of human skin fibroblasts. Cells adhered and proliferated on both PHBV fibers and 2-D films. However, the proliferation of cells on the surface of PHBV fibers was comparable to tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS, control) (p > 0.05). The gene expression of collagen I and elastin was significantly up-regulated when compared with TCPS control, whereas collagen III was down-regulated on PHBV fibers and 2-D film after 14 days in culture. The less ductile PHBV 2-D films showed higher levels of elastin expression. Furthermore, the PHBV fibers in the presence and absence of an angiogenesis factor (R-Spondin 1) were evaluated for their wound healing capacity in a rat model. The wound contracture in R-Spondin-1-loaded PHBV fibers was found to be significantly higher when compared with PHBV fibers alone after 7 days (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the presence of fibers promoted an increase in collagen and aided re-epithelialization. Thus our results demonstrate that the topography and mechanical and chemical stimuli have a pronounced influence on the cell proliferation, gene expression, and wound healing. © 2011 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Authentication in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is a challenging process. Providing authentication for the Nodes in WSN is a vital issue in Secure Group communication among WSNs. Massive group of tiny sensor Nodes form WSNs and these are placed in open, unattended milieu. Due to this reason, Nodes in WSN can endure exclusive encounters. WSNs are more vulnerable to active and passive attacks than wired ones due to their broadcasting nature, limitations in resources and unrestrained environments. However, security will be a significant factor for their complete implementation. In this paper, a new protocol based on congruence equations and number theory concepts have been introduced to achieve secure authentication among Nodes in WSNs. The proposed protocol uses Fermat Number Theorem (FNT) and Combinations of Chinese Remainder Theorem with Fermat Numbers (CRT-FN) to enhance the strength of authentication mechanism among the sensor Nodes. In between Node to Node authentication FNT is used, Cluster head to Node and Base station to Cluster head CRT-FN is used. Comparison of the proposed protocol with existing protocols is done. It reflects that it provides instant authentication, minimum memory utilization and withstands DoS attack, cloning attack, replay attack, eavesdropping and Man in the middle attack. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={The anti lipid peroxidative and antioxidant effects of ellagic acid against isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarcted rats were reported previously. This study was designed to evaluate the protective effects of ellagic acid on the levels of cardiac troponin-T, lysosomal enzymes, and membrane bound ATPases along with the role of pro inflammatory cytokine. Male albino Wistar rats were pretreated with ellagic acid (7.5 and 15 mg/kg body weight) daily for a period of 10 days. After the pretreatment period isoproterenol (100 mg/kg) was subcutaneously injected to rats twice at an interval of 24 h. The protective effects of pretreatment with ellagic acid were measured by biochemical analysis and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Evidence of myocardial infarction in isoproterenol induced rats included significant increase in the serum level of cardiac troponin-T and decreased levels of creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase in heart tissue homogenate .The pretreatment with ellagic acid restored the levels of cardiac markers in the serum and heart tissue homogenates. The activities of lysosomal enzymes (β-D-glucuronidase, β-N-acetyl glucosaminidase, β-galactosidase, cathepsin-d and acid phosphatase) were increased significantly in the serum and heart tissue of isoproterenol-induced rats. The activity of Na+/K+ATPase declined while the activities of Ca2+ATPase and Mg2+ATPase were increased significantly in the heart of isoproterenol-induced rats. Pretreatment with ellagic acid restored the activities of lysosomal enzymes and membrane bound ATPases. The higher expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β, interleukin-6 and tumour necrosis factor-α in the isoproterenol-induced rats were controlled by the pretreatment with ellagic acid. Our results imply that oral pretreatment with ellagic acid protects the heart lysosomal membrane against isoproterenol-induced cardiac damage. The observed effects might be due to the free radical scavenging, membrane stabilizing and anti-inflammatory properties of ellagic acid. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Present complexity of System on Chip (SoC) design is increasing rapidly in the number of test patterns, huge switching activity and its transition time. This large test data volume is becoming one of the major problems in association with huge switching activity and its corresponding response time. This paper considers the problem of huge test pattern and its switching activity in scan based design. This proposed algorithm is based on reducing test pattern and its huge switching activity on scan shift in operation. This is achieved by equally segmenting the scan based test patterns and identifying test data transition inside the segment. Each scan test pattern is considered by its transition and segmented into equal necessary blocks. This reduces test pattern and overall switching activity of the flip-flop in the design. Theoretical analysis and experimental results on ISCAS89 shows that the proposed method reduces test pattern by 37% and total switching activity by 75% when compared to the traditional approaches.},

A series of processable poly(ether sulfone)s were prepared by nucleophilic substitution reaction of new dichloro compounds with commercially available aromatic diols. The poly(ether sulfone)s were characterized by infrared, X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, solubility and solution viscosity. These poly(ether sulfone)s are readily soluble in polar aprotic solvents. The improved solubility in common organic solve ts is due to the presence of flexible ether, thioether and sulfone groups in a polymer backbone. These poly(ether sulfone)s exhibit good thermal stability and the 10% weight loss temperature ranged from 407 to 464 °C under N2 atmosphere. The X-ray diffraction patterns revealed that all these polymers are partially crystalline in nature. © SAGE Publications 2011.},

abstract={The thermodynamic stabilities (δG, free energy change) of proteins are being measured by traditional denaturation methods (δGU, free energy of unfolding) and native hydrogen-deuterium (H/D) exchange method δGHX, free energy of exchange), in general. Estimation of an accurate δG for proteins at ambient conditions is indispensable to unambiguously address the folding events of the proteins, which may pave the way of designing de novo therapeutic peptides with defined functions. However, the ΔGU and the ΔGHX of proteins are not in good agreement, in general. Herein, we have developed a META program, which accounts the discrepancies between the ΔGU and the ΔGHX of proteins by predicting the possible existence of higher energy metastable states in the folding kinetics of proteins under native conditions by systematically analysing residue-specific free energies of the proteins. The robustness of the program on analyzing the conformational stabilities of proteins has been validated using experimental data available in the literature and the implication of the program on medicinal chemistry is also discussed. The program is publicly available at http://feat.sastra.edu/meta.html.},

abstract={In the present work, three different spectrophotometric methods for simultaneous estimation of ramipril, aspirin and atorvastatin calcium in raw materials and in formulations are described. Overlapped data was quantitatively resolved by using chemometric methods, viz. inverse least squares (ILS), principal component regression (PCR) and partial least squares (PLS). Calibrations were constructed using the absorption data matrix corresponding to the concentration data matrix. The linearity range was found to be 1-5, 10-50 and 2-10 μg mL-1 for ramipril, aspirin and atorvastatin calcium, respectively. The absorbance matrix was obtained by measuring the zero-order absorbance in the wavelength range between 210 and 320 nm. A training set design of the concentration data corresponding to the ramipril, aspirin and atorvastatin calcium mixtures was organized statistically to maximize the information content from the spectra and to minimize the error of multivariate calibrations. By applying the respective algorithms for PLS 1, PCR and ILS to the measured spectra of the calibration set, a suitable model was obtained. This model was selected on the basis of RMSECV and RMSEP values. The same was applied to the prediction set and capsule formulation. Mean recoveries of the commercial formulation set together with the figures of merit (calibration sensitivity, selectivity, limit of detection, limit of quantification and analytical sensitivity) were estimated. Validity of the proposed approaches was successfully assessed for analyses of drugs in the various prepared physical mixtures and formulations.},

abstract={Among various insulation diagnostic techniques utilized by researchers and personnel handling power equipment, partial discharge (PD) recognition and analysis has emerged as a vital methodology since it is inherently a non-intrusive testing strategy. Of late, the focus of researchers has shifted to the identification and classification of multiple sources of PD since it is most often encountered in practical insulation systems of power apparatus. Researchers have carried out studies to recognize multi-source PD and expounded the difficulties experienced in discriminating such discharge patterns. It has also been observed that identification of such patterns becomes increasingly difficult with the degree of overlap. Review of recent research studies indicates that classification of fully overlapped patterns is yet an unresolved issue and that techniques such as Mixed Weibull Functions, neural networks (NN) and Wavelet Transformation have been attempted with reasonable degree of success for single source and partially overlapped PD patterns only. This research study focuses on extending the previous work attempted by the authors in utilizing the novel approach of Heteroscedastic Probabilistic Neural Network (HRPNN) for classification of single source PD patterns to that of multiple PD sources also. Further, a Robust Heteroscedastic Probabilistic Neural Network (RHRPNN) is implemented for the classification of multi-source PD patterns. The RHRPNN utilizes the jackknife procedure for handling problems associated with training the neural network due to the presence of outliers, thus providing a compact yet effective set of centers in terms of probability density functions. In addition to the previously utilized traditional statistical operators in the pre-processing phase, a Two Pass Split Window (TPSW) scheme has also been developed to study and compare the classification capability of the RHRPNN with that of HRPNN. Detailed analysis of the performance of RHRPNN is carried out to ascertain the influence of the smoothing parameter in classifying PD patterns, to determine the role played by the pre-processing techniques during classification and to find the significance of the parsimonious set of centers in eliminating the effect of outliers during classification. Finally, the ability of the HRPNN and the RHRPNN in classifying large dataset multiple source PD patterns obtained from varying applied voltages is analyzed for its further applicability in real-time PD pattern recognition studies. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The petroleum ether and chloroform (1:1) fraction, which showed the presence of a single sterol is subjected to structural elucidation by spectroscopical methods such as UV, IR, 13C NMR, 1H NMR and mass spectroscopical studies. The isolated sterol is subjected to antioxidant studies by means of DPPH radical scavenging activity, nitric oxide radical scavenging assays and reducing power ability and lipid peroxidation assay. Ascorbic acid is used as the standard. The isolated compound is characterized as a cholestanol derivative, (16-(3,7,11,15-Tetramethyl-2-hexadecen-1-ol)-2-methylene(3α,5α)- cholestan-3-ol) and it is poor in its antioxidant potential as compared to the standard. Delonix regia (Boj. ex Hook) Raf which is known only for its ornamental value is found to be rich in its phytoconstituents. Isolation and characterization of phytoconstituents of the same may leads to the presence of a novel chemical entity which may be named as 16-(3,7,11,15-Tetramethyl-2-hexadecen- 1-ol)-2-methylene(3α,5α)-cholestan-3-ol.

abstract={A column switching high performance liquid chromatographic method with estimable sensitivity and accuracy was developed for the determination of cetirizine and ambroxol in human plasma using nebivolol as the internal standard. Plasma samples were prepared by liquid-liquid extraction in methylene chloride and a mixture of diethylether (80:20, v/v). The extracted samples were injected into a multifunctional clean-up column SupelcosilTM LCABZ (50mm×4.6mm, 5μm particle size) using mobile phase 1 comprising acetonitrile-phosphate buffer (pH 3.5; 20mM) (20:80, v/v). The eluate of cetirizine and ambroxol were separated to an analytical Kromasil C8 micro bore column (50mm×0.3mm, 5μm particle size) via a column switching device. A Kromasil C18 analytical column (250mm×2.1mm, 5μm particle size) was used as a separation column. Mobile phase 2 consisting acetonitrile-triethylamine (0.5%) in phosphate buffer (pH 3.5; 20mM) (55:45, v/v) was used for the compound elution. The eluents were detected at 230nm with photodiode array detector. An aliquot of 150μl of plasma sample was introduced into the pretreatment column via the auto sampler using mobile phase 1 at a flow rate of 0.5ml/min, column switching valve being positioned at A. The pretreatment column retained cetirizine, ambroxol and nebivolol (IS) in the column leaving the residual proteins of plasma eluted in void volume and drained out. The switching valve was shifted to position B at 7.5min. Cetirizine, ambroxol and IS were eluted from the pretreatment column between 7. 5 and 11.5min and introduced to the concentration column. Finally, cetirizine, ambroxol and IS were introduced to the separation column by switching valve using mobile phase 2 at a flow rate of 0.4ml/min. During the analysis the pretreatment column was washed for the next analysis and resume to the position A. The total run time was 25min for a sample. The procedure was repeated for urine analysis also. The method was linear from 2 to 450ng/ml and 7-300ng/ml for cetirizine and ambroxol respectively in plasma and 1-500ng/ml and 5-400ng/ml, respectively for cetirizine and ambroxol in urine. Intra-day and inter-day precision of cetirizine and ambroxol was below 15% in terms of coefficient of variation and accuracy of cetirizine and ambroxol was ranged from 94 to 101.6% and 91.1 to 100.2%, respectively. The method demonstrated high sensitivity and selectivity and therefore, applied to evaluate pharmacokinetics of cetirizine and ambroxol in healthy human volunteer after a single oral administration. Urine samples obtained from healthy human volunteers and clinical subjects with renal impairment have also been analyzed by the method to compare the elimination pattern. The method was precise and accurate for the estimation of cetirizine and ambroxol both in blood and in urine. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={A three-dimensional numerical modeling of a uniformly doped nanoscale FinFET including quantummechanical effects has been developed. A self-consistent solution of 3D Poisson-Schrödinger equation has been obtained using multiresolution approach to achieve adaptively refined mesh that can be used to get a solution with the same level of accuracy of a reference, but with a considerable lower number of points. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach for the self-consistent solution to surface potential computations of nanoscale FinFET device using interpolating wavelets. It performs an efficient computation by dynamically adjusting the computational mesh in order to obtain surface potential variations during simulation. This method allows non-uniform grids and scales the CPU time linearly with the number of mesh points. The exact potential profile, subthreshold swing (S) and threshold voltage (Vth) rolloff are estimated. The accuracy of the model has been verified with finite difference, finite element and experimental results. This method provides more accurate results than other existing methods. © Springer Science+Business Media LLC 2011.},

abstract={The aim of this study was to investigate the nephroprotective and antioxidant property of Manasamitra vatakam (MMV) against aluminum (Al)-induced toxicity in rats.

Similarly, the antioxidant enzyme activities such as superoxide dismutase, glutathione S-transferase, Na +/K +-ATPase and Mg-ATPase, reduced glutathione were also found significantly increased in Al-treated rats. A significantly decreased level of these parameters was observed in the MMV (orally 100mg kg -1 body weight)-treated group along with a reduced level of malonaldehyde, molecular chaperones of an antioxidative stress protein, and mRNA expression of HSP70. The biochemical observations were also supported by histopathological observations. Thus, this study supports the nephroprotective and antioxidant activities of MMV. © 2011 Taylor &amp; Francis.},

abstract={The enzyme aldoreductase which plays an important role in pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy was purified from bovine lens, and its inhibitory activity was studied with the synthesized flavone derivatives 1-(2-hydroxyphenyl)ethanone as the starting material. Experimental study revealed that 2-chloroflavone shows less inhibitory activity of 60-70% than other flavones used in the study. To validate experimental results computationally, docking studies of new flavone derivatives synthesized were performed with the enzyme aldose reductase, and the results indicate that 3-iodo, 4-methyl, 5-chloroflavone and 2-chloroflavone bind with higher and lesser affinities. Docking studies with site directed mutagenesis of Val47Ile, Tyr48His, Pro121Phe, Trp219Tyr, Cys298Ala, Leu300Pro, Ser302Arg, and Cys303Asp of the enzyme altered the inhibition activity of aldose reductase. The regression value (R 2 ) of 0.81 between the docking scores of the known inhibitors and the experimental logIC50 indicates the reliability of the docking studies. Biological activity and carcinogenic properties predict that 3-iodo, 4-methyl, 5-chloroflavone is the best flavone inhibitor against aldose reductase. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.},

Due to sensor node constraint, Key Management plays an important role. Existing Key Management Schemes (KMS) for Cluster-based architecture either supports Group communication or Node-to-Node communication. The proposed hybrid KMS concentrates on both Group communication and Node-to-Node communication using LU matrix and to enhance the strength of the security between cluster head and base station the ElGamal Public key encryption techniques is used. The main feature of this proposed protocol is 100% Node-to-Node connectivity and perfect resilience is achieved when Sensor node/Cluster Head is compromised. The scheme and its detailed performance analysis are discussed in this paper. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Gone are the days when machines were the world's "prime movers". Today, the "prime mover" of the world is information, particularly, secret information. It is also a commodity whose value perishes with time. This dual-quality of power and perish-ability makes information to be the wealth, most difficult to protect on the earth. Nevertheless, in order to protect the secret information, technology has given us methods which provide security, though not a fool-proof one. Steganography is one such method which incorporates security by hiding the very existence of the secret by camouflaging it inside an image. In addition to the enormous security provided by the steganographic algorithms, if we implement some security in the very methodology of transmission and reception of an image, it would prove to be an useful venture. Such an useful venture is proposed in this paper, where four different users can transmit secret messages through a single stego image by taking advantage of the OFDM-QPSK(Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing-Quadrature Phase Shift Keying) duo, thereby imparting multiple-access and improving security in an otherwise normal stego image. Comparison of BER in AWGN and Random Noise channel has also been done in order to quantify the effectiveness of the proposed technique. © 2011 IEEE.},

The weight loss measurements at four different temperatures such as 30, 40, 50, and 60 'C showed that the percentage inhibition efficiency (IE) of these compounds increased with increase of concentration and decreased with increase of temperature. The IE followed the order III<II<I. It was found that these inhibitors function through physical adsorption mechanism obeying Temkin's isotherm. Polarization studies showed that these compounds act as mixed-type inhibitors. Impedance measurements revealed the increase of charge transfer resistance with inhibitor concentration. Surface analysis using SEM, XRD, and FT-IR revealed the formation of protective film over the mild steel surface. The electronic properties calculated using AM1 semi-empirical method explained the inhibition characteristics. The quantum chemical studies showed that ring nitrogen and phenyl rings are the probable active centers to inhibit corrosion process. © ASM International.},

The aim of the present study is to evaluate the cardioprotective effect of Cymbopogon citratus, which is used as a culinary item and commonly known as lemon grass (LG), in isoproterenol-induced cardiotoxicity. Male Wistar albino rats were segregated into five different groups as follows. Groups I and II rats were treated with vehicle. Groups III and IV rats were treated with 100 and 200 mg/kg b.wt. of LG. Group V with 100 mg/kg b.wt. of vitamin E. Myocardial necrosis was induced in Groups II, III, IV and V on 58 th and 59 th day using isoproterenol at a dose of 85 mg/kg twice at 24-hour interval. Animals were sacrificed on the 60 th day. LG pretreatment exhibited cardioprotective activity as evidenced by decreased activity of cardiac markers in serum and increased the same in heart homogenate (p &lt; 0.05). LG administration decreased the toxic events of lipid peroxidation (TBARS) in both serum and heart tissue, by increasing the level of enzymatic antioxidants and non-enzymatic antioxidants significantly in both heart homogenate and serum sample (p &lt; 0.05). The histopathological observations also revealed that the cardioprotective effect of LG extract was observed at a dose of 200 mg/kg b.wt. The results of the present study reveal that LG is cardioprotective and antilipid peroxidative by increasing various antioxidants at a dose of 200 mg/kg b.wt., which is comparable with that of vitamin E. © The Author(s) 2010.},

abstract={Landslide susceptibility mapping is the first step in regional hazard management as it helps to understand the spatial distribution of the probability of slope failure in an area. An attempt is made to map the landslide susceptibility in Tevankarai Ar sub-watershed, Kodaikkanal, India using binary logistic regression analysis. Geographic Information System is used to prepare the database of the predictor variables and landslide inventory map, which is used to build the spatial model of landslide susceptibility. The model describes the relationship between the dependent variable (presence and absence of landslide) and the independent variables selected for study (predictor variables) by the best fitting function. A forward stepwise logistic regression model using maximum likelihood estimation is used in the regression analysis. An inventory of 84 landslides and cells within a buffer distance of 10m around the landslide is used as the dependent variable. Relief, slope, aspect, plan curvature, profile curvature, land use, soil, topographic wetness index, proximity to roads and proximity to lineaments are taken as independent variables. The constant and the coefficient of the predictor variable retained by the regression model are used to calculate the probability of slope failure and analyze the effect of each predictor variable on landslide occurrence in the study area. The model shows that the most significant parameter contributing to landslides is slope. The other significant parameters are profile curvature, soil, road, wetness index and relief. The predictive logistic regression model is validated using temporal validation data-set of known landslide locations and shows an accuracy of 85.29 %. © 2011 Science Press, Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={In this study, global (50°S-50°N) distribution of water vapor is investigated using COSMIC GPS RO measurements. Detailed comparisons have been made between COSMIC and high resolution GPS radiosonde measurements across 13 tropical stations and model outputs (ERA-Interim, NCEP, and JRA-25 reanalyses data sets). In comparison with independent techniques like radiosonde (Väisälä), it is found that COSMIC GPS RO wet profiles are accurate up to 7-8. km (assuming radiosonde as standard technique). In general, comparisons with corresponding seasonal means of model outputs are qualitatively in good agreement, although they differ quantitatively especially over convective regions of South America, Africa, and Indonesia. In tropical latitudes, the COSMIC specific humidity values are higher than the model outputs. Among various model outputs, ERA-Interim data set show near realistic features to that observed by COSMIC GPS RO measurements. Large asymmetry in the specific humidity distribution is observed between northern and southern hemispheres. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The biosensor design for sensing of biological signals is highly complex for accurate detection. Optimal detection of biological signals is necessary for distinguishing different tissues. This paper proposes a threshold-based detection technique which provides significant improvement in FinFET optical biosensor performance using wavelet coeffcients. It uses a simple maximum likelihood (ML) function for detecting the threshold values. In this method, we have considered the different layers of body tissue as a turbid medium. To the best of our knowledge, this method is the first of its kind for classifying different tissues using threshold value of optical signals obtained from the surface potential variations of nanoscale FinFET illuminated by laser source of different wavelengths. By using this method, the point to point variations in tissue composition and structural variations in healthy and diseased tissues could be identified. The results obtained are used to examine the performance of the device for its suitable use as a nanoscale sensor.},

abstract={The purpose of the research was to prepare Orlistat niosomes from proniosome to improve its poor and variable oral bioavailability. The non-ionic surfactant vesicles are prepared by the reverse phase evaporation technique (slurry method). The slurry of β-Cyclodextrin and Span 60 was dried to form a free flowing powder in rotary flash evaporator which could be rehydrated by addition of buffer (0.5% NaCl with 3% SLS at pH 6.0). The lipid mixture consisted of cholesterol, Span 60 and β-Cyclodextrin carrier in molar ratios of (0.1:0.9:1 to 0.9:0.1:1 respectively). The niosomal formulations were evaluated for particle size, entrapment efficiency, in-vitro drug release, release kinetics, Interactions and compatibility (FT-IR), surface morphology (SEM), stability studies, conductivity and sedimentation rate, pH density, viscosity. The formulation OT9 which showed higher entrapment efficiency of 44.09% and in vitro releases of 94.59% at the end of 12hrs was found to be best among all the 9 formulations. Release was best fitted with Hixson kinetics and it shows that the drug release may follow diffusion mechanism. FT-IR data revealed that, compatible and there were no interactions between the drug and excipients added in the formulation. SEM images of niosomes with various magnifications revealed the mean size of the niosomes were 100 nm with smooth surface. Niosome formulation has showed appropriate stability for 90 days by storing the formulation at room temperature. Thus the niosomal formulations could be a promising delivery system for Orlistat with improved oral bioavailability, stability and for sustained drug release. © 2010 IJDDR.},

abstract={Nanostructured ZnO thin films were coated on glass substrate by spray pyrolysis using Zinc acetate dihydrate as precursor. Effect of precursor concentration on structural, morphological, optical and electrical properties of the films was investigated. The crystal structure and orientation of the ZnO thin films prepared with four different precursor solution concentrations were studied and it was observed that, the prepared films are polycrystalline in nature with hexagonal wurzite structure. The peaks are indexed to (100), (002), (101), (102) and (110) planes. Grain size and texture coefficient (TC) were calculated and the grain size found to increase with an increase in precursor concentration. Presence of Zn and O elements was confirmed with EDAX spectra. Optical absorption measurements were carried out in the wavelength region of 380 to 800 nm and the band gap decreases as precursor concentration increases. The current-voltage characteristics were observed at room temperature and in dark. It was found that for the films deposited at four different precursor concentrations, the conductivity improves as precursor concentration increases. As trimethyl amine TMA is a good marker for food quality discrimination, sensing behavior of the films at an optimized operating temperature of 373 K, towards various concentrations of (TMA) was observed and reported. © 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

abstract={Background &amp; Objectives: Liver is a versatile organ that regulates the internal environment of the body and hence becomes prone to toxicity. Despite the tremendous strides in modern medicine there is still a need for a drug that stimulates liver function. Hence the present study focuses on the study of the hepatoprotective potentials of Curcuma amada Roxb. in CCl 4 induced toxicity. Methods: Aqueous extract of C.amada (AECA) was prepared as per protocol. Hepatotoxicity was induced in the experimental models with CCl 4 . At the end of the experimental period the animals were sacrificed by cervical decapitation. Blood and tissues were collected for assessment of SGOT, SGPT, SALP, SGGT, S.Protein, S.Bilirubin, S.Urea, Tissue Glycogen, Lipid peroxide levels, GSH and Gpx. Results: The CCl 4 induction caused an elevation in the serum marker enzymes, bilirubin and Lipid peroxide levels. There was a decrease in the serum protein, urea, tissue glycogen levels and the antioxidant status indicating hepatic damage. The treatment of the animals with AECA depicted the restoration of these parameters in serum and liver. Interpretation &amp; Conclusion: The restoration of the hepatic functioning which was made evident from the levels of the serum and tissue markers suggests the protective activity of C.amada. Thus the present study brings to lime light the protective effect of Curcuma amada.},

The effect of the leaf powder on functioning against carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced hepatic damage was studied by assessing the biochemical parameters such as alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total bilirubin (TB) and uric acid in serum of the rats. The concentrations of the hepatic markers were remarkably increased in the CCl4-induced hepatic rats when compared to rats of normal control. After the Aegle marmelos leaf powder administration for 14 days to the rats with hepatic damage induced by CCl4, it was found that the concentrations of the hepatic enzymes in the rats were comparable to that of healthy control rats. Strikingly, it has also been noticed that concentrations of the hepatic markers of rats treated with standard drug (Liv.52) and that of rats treated with the crude leaf powder are similar, within statistical errors, to each other indicating that Aegle marmelos leaf powder may contain lead phytochemicals that may presumably pave the way of designing highly potent hepataprotective compounds/drugs.},

abstract={The oral bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of a locally manufactured test (Anastrozole) and reference (Arimidex®) formulations were compared in healthy postmenopausal/surgically sterile female volunteers. Volunteers were treated with 1 mg Anastrozole tablet, (test or reference) under fasting conditions with a washout period of 21 days. Blood samples were collected at scheduled time points and plasma concentrations of Anastrozole were analyzed by LC-MS/MS method. Following oral administration of both formulations, there was rapid and extensive oral absorption from gastrointestinal tract achieving maximum serum concentration within 2 hrs. The concentration-time profile generated by the two products was found to be super imposable. Peak plasma concentration (Cmax), area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC0-t), area under the serum concentration-time curve extrapolated to infinity (AUC0-∞) and elimination half-life (t1/2) were 16.24 ± 1.50 and 16.02 ± 1.59 ng/mL, 780.11 ± 1.61 and 800.57 ± 1.66 ng.hr/mL, 834.49 ± 1.64 and 866.11 ± 1.70 ng.hr/mL, 53.29 (31.55-79.13) and 57.06 (32.77-87.75) hr for Anastrozole and Arimidex® respectively. The result indicates that these two formulations have similar rate as well as extent of absorption. Hence these two products can be said to have comparable bioavailability.},

abstract={Partial Discharge (PD) pattern recognition has emerged as a subject of vital interest for the diagnosis of complex insulation system of power equipment to personnel handling power system utilities and researchers alike, since the phenomenon serves inherently as an excellent non-intrusive testing technique. Recently, the focus of researchers has shifted to the recognition of defects in insulation due to multiple PD sources, as it is often encountered during real-time PD measurements. A survey of research literature indicates clearly that the recognition of fully overlapped PD patterns is yet an unresolved issue and that techniques such as Mixed Weibull Function, Neural Network (NN), Wavelet Transformation, etc. have been attempted with only reasonable success. Since most digital PD online acquisition systems record data for a stipulated and considerable duration as mandated by international standards, the database is large. This poses substantial complexity in classification during the training phase of the NNs. These difficulties may be attributed to ill-conditioned data, non-Markovian nature of discharges, curse of dimensionality of the data, etc. Since training methods based on random selection of centers from a large training set of fixed size are found to be relatively insensitive and detrimental to classification in many cases, a Forward Orthogonal Least Square algorithm (FOLS) is utilized in order to reduce the number of hidden layer neurons and obtain a parsimonious yet optimal set of centers. This algorithm, in addition, obviates the need for a separate clustering method making the procedure inherently viable for on-line PD recognition. This research work proposes a novel approach of utilizing Radial Basis Probabilistic Neural Network (RBPNN) with FOLS center selection algorithm for classification of multiple PD sources. Exhaustive analysis is carried out to ascertain the efficacy of classification of the proposed RBPNN-FOLS algorithm to cater to large training data set. A detailed comparison of the performance of the proposed scheme with that of the standard version of Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) and Heteroscedastic PNN (HRPNN) that was taken up for study by the authors in their previous work indicates firstly the effectiveness of FOLS algorithm in obtaining parsimonious centers, points out secondly the capability of the Radial Basis Probabilistic Neural Network (RBPNN) model to integrate the advantages of the Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) and PNN in classifying multiple PD sources and finally throws light on the exceptional capability of the FOLS-RBPNN in discriminating the sources of PD due to varying applied voltages also. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Background and objectives: In general all the patients having diabetes mellitus in due course of time succumb to the complaint of neuropathy it is observed that the herbal treatment under Siddha system is prevalently seen with the usage of Salacia oblanga. In Siddha system of medicine, herbs are practiced to the treatment of diabetes mellitus. The present paper deals about the effect of Salacia oblanga in the management of diabetic neuropathy. Methods: Generally, Streptozotocin (STZ) iriduced rat model is taken to test the extracts against diabetic complaints. Within a few days of induction, the appearance of hyperglycemia is noticed in this STZ model. In turn, it brings a reduction of nerve conduction velocity and a loss of sensitivity. After a period of one month stage in hyperglycemia diabetes; symptoms pertaining to diabetic neuropathy are seen, they are characterized by increased thermal perception thresholds (hypoalgesia) using the tailflick method arid paw-withdrawal method. It is nothing but progress to sensory loss; occurring in conjunction with degeneration of all types of peripheral nerve fibers. Results: 300 mg of hydro-alcoholic extract from the dried powdered roots of Salacia oblanga was given orally once a day for 60 days. The untreated diabetic animals have shown the appearance of neuropathy symptoms like tropic ulcer on tail, slight edema in the paws of the legs and the appearance of lethargism and they were appearing sickly. Conclusion: After 60 days of treatment with test drug, the fasting blood sugar came down to almost normal value in diabetic rats along with the disappearance of neuropathy symptoms.},

abstract={Purpose. To explore the possibility of stathmin as an effective therapeutic target and to evaluate the synergistic combination of stathmin RNAi and the antimicrotubule agents paclitaxel and vincristine to retinoblastoma Y79 cells. Methods. RNAi-mediated specific inhibition of stathmin expression in Y79 cells was shown by real-time quantitative RT-PCR (RT-Q-PCR), its effect on cell proliferation by MTT assay, cell invasion using matrigel, microtubule polymerization by immunohistochemistry, apoptosis, cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry analysis, and the changes in FOXM1 protein expression were studied by Western blot. The effect of combination treatment of stathmin siRNA and paclitaxel/ vincristine was studied by assessing cell viability and apoptosis. Results. Short interfering RNA-mediated transient stathmin downregulation resulted in a marked inhibition of retinoblastoma cell proliferation and cell invasion in vitro. Stathmin inhibition promoted Y79 cells to G2/M phase, and ultimately there were increased apoptotic events as evidenced by higher caspase-3 activation and cleaved poly- (ADP-ribose) polymerase expression. Cells transfected with stathmin siRNA showed long and bundled microtubule polymers and sensitized the Y79 cells significantly to paclitaxel and vincristine. Conclusions. Stathmin may be a pivotal determinant for retinoblastoma tumorigenesis and chemosensitivity. Strategies to inhibit stathmin will help to enhance the cytotoxic effect of paclitaxel while reducing toxicity (or side effects) to normal cells caused by high doses. © 2011 The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, Inc.},

The proposed method performs decomposition of the region into disjoint sub-regions by detecting the features of the contour such as bend points, vertical & horizontal straight lines, etc. The representation of those sub-regions is achieved by using strings in a six letter alphabet. The representation is invariant to size since it includes a size-based ratio. The drawbacks of existing contour-based shape representation techniques are discussed, and it is shown how this new method overcomes them. Copyright © 2011 ACM.},

abstract={Ethnopharmacological relevance: Shilajit is a multi-component natural occurring mineral substance used in Ayurveda and Siddha systems of medicine which originated in India. Its source can be traced to the mountainous regions, where the hilly tribes first identified its beneficial use. Shilajit is aptly referred to as 'rasayana'/'rasayanam' in Ayurveda and Siddha literature which means rejuvenator because it prevents ailment and enhances the quality of life. Materials and Methods: An attempt has been put forth to review shilajit pertaining to its origin, synonyms, varieties, physical properties, chemical constituents, therapeutic properties and important biological properties to affirm its rasayana property. All relevant information on shilajit was collected from classical texts including pharmacopoeias, formularies, etc. Moreover, select doctoral thesis from Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi and Gujarat Ayurved University, Jamnagar were also scanned. Published papers on shilajit were collected from important databases for biomedical sciences. Amongst, the various biological properties of shilajit, antioxidant activity and immuno-modulatory activity were focused as it is closely related to its rasayana potential. Results: This review finds that shilajit is used in twenty Sastric formulations and twenty-four proprietary drugs for extraneous indications. Even-though, there is a long history of use of shilajit in traditional Indian materia medica, shilajit unfortunately lacks scientific evaluation and systematic documentation. In vivo antioxidant activity of shilajit has been studied at an irrelevant dose and without using a positive control. The immuno-modulatory activity does not stand the test of critical assessment and currently may be considered as unproven. Conclusion: Based on the earlier studies, the bioactivity of shilajit lacks substantial evidence. Nevertheless, further studies are imperative to overcome the lacuna in establishing the antioxidant property of shilajit and more specific assays are needed to vouch shilajit as an immuno-modulator which may be of use to establish its rasayana potential. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

Currently available skin substitutes which restores the tissue function have had limited success. Tissue engineering has been exploited to design a scaffold which mimics the extracellular matrix (ECM) in its structure and function. Recently electrospinning has emerged as an important technique for fabricating these scaffolds because of its unique ability to generate nanofibres with appropriate physical, mechanical and biological properties to support cell growth, proliferation, migration and differentiation.

abstract={Edge of image is one of the most fundamental and significant features. Edge detection is always one of the classical studying projects of computer vision and image processing field. It is the first step of image analysis and understanding. With the continuous improvement of remote sensing image, especially the appearance of Digital Aerial Image, edge detection is necessary step to extract information from the Digital Aerial images. The purpose of edge detection is to discover the information about the shapes and the reflectance or transmittance in an image. The correctness and reliability of its results affect directly the comprehension machine system made for objective world. In this paper FPGA-based architecture for edge detection algorithms has been proposed. The implementation of edge detection algorithms on a field programmable gate array (FPGA) is having advantage of using large memory and embedded multipliers. FPGAs are providing a platform for processing real time algorithms on application-specific hardware with substantially higher performance than programmable digital signal processors (DSPs). The proposed architecture can be used as a building block of a aerial imaging systems for navigation and for the pattern recognition. The hardware implementation results are presented for the Sobel and Prewitt operator. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={The objective of the present study is to investigate the nootropic activity of aqueous and 95% ethanolic extracts of aerial parts of Alternanthera sessilis Linn. R.Br.ex.DC (Amaranthaceae). Alternanthera sessilis Linn, commonly known as sessile joy weed a well known herb with fleshy leaves. The herb is mainly used as cholagogue, galactogue, intellect promoting, strength, diarrhea, constipation, leprosy, skin disease and dyspepsia. The nootropic activity was assessed by recording the effect of ethanolic and aqueous extracts of Alternanthera sessilis Linn in albino mice at about doses of 125 mg/kg body weight, 250 mg/kg body weight and 500 mg/kg body weight for a period of 9 days on transfer latency, number of entries in to an enclosed arm and duration of occupancy in the enclosed arm. Results showed significant improvement in the retention ability of the normal and amnesic mice as compared to their respective controls. The data emanated in the present study suggests improvement of cholinergic system or inhibition of acetyl choline esterase enzyme is responsible for nootropic activity. Thus we can conclude that Alternanthera sessilis Linn R.BR.ex. DC (Amaranthaceae) possesses potent nootropic activity.},

abstract={Steganography is used to hide a secret message within a cover image, thereby yielding a stego image such that even the trace of the presence of secret information is wiped out. The purpose of steganography is to maintain secret communication between two users. Steganography has several technical challenges namely high hiding capacity and imperceptibility. In this paper we propose a modern steganographic technique with Integer Wavelet transform (IWT) and double key to achieve high hiding capacity, high security and good visual quality. Here cover image is converted in to wavelet transform co-efficients and the coefficients are selected randomly by using Key-1 for embedding the data. Key-2 is used to calculate the number of bits to be embedded in the randomly selected coefficients. Finally the Optimum Pixel Adjustment Process (OPAP) is applied to the stego image to reduce the data embedding error. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={The present study was designed to evaluate the cardioprotective effects of ellagic acid against isoproterenol induced myocardial infarction in rats by studying electrocardiography, blood pressure, cardiac markers, lipid peroxidation, antioxidant defense system and histological changes. Male Wistar rats were treated orally with ellagic acid (7.5 and 15 mg/kg) daily for a period of 10 days. After 10 days of pretreatment, isoproterenol (100 mg/kg) was injected subcutaneously to rats at an interval of 24 h for 2 days to induce myocardial infarction. Isoproterenol administered rats showed significant changes in the electrocardiogram pattern, arterial pressure, and heart rate. Isoproterenol-induced rats also showed significant (P < 0.05) increase in the levels of serum troponin-I, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, plasma homocysteine, heart tissue thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and lipid hydro peroxides. The activities/levels of antioxidant system were decreased in isoproterenol-induced rats. The histopathological findings of the myocardial tissue evidenced myocardial damage in isoproterenol induced rats. The oral pretreatment of ellagic acid restored the pathological electrocardiographic patterns, regulated the arterial blood pressures and heart rate in the isoproterenol induced myocardial infarcted rats. The ellagic acid pretreatment significantly reduced the levels of biochemical markers, lipid peroxidation and significantly increased the activities/levels of the antioxidant system in the isoproterenol induced rats. An inhibited myocardial necrosis was evidenced by the histopathological findings in ellagic acid pretreated isoproterenol induced rats. Our study shows that oral pretreatment of ellagic acid prevents isoproterenol induced oxidative stress in myocardial infarction. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Liver is a versatile organ that regulates the internal environment of the body and hence becomes prone to toxicity. Despite the tremendous strides in modern medicine there is still a need for a drug that stimulates liver function. Aqueous extract of M.arvensis (AEMA) was prepared as per protocol. Hepatotoxicity was induced in the experimental models with alcohol. At the end of the experimental period the animals were sacrificed by cervical decapitation. Blood and tissues were collected for assessment of SGOT, SGPT, SALP, SGGT, S.Protein, S.Bilirubin, Tissue Glycogen, Lipid peroxide levels, SOD, GSH, GST and Gpx. The alcohol induction caused an elevation in the serum marker enzymes, bilirubin and Lipid peroxide levels. There was a decrease in the serum protein, tissue glycogen and the antioxidant status indicating hepatic damage. The treatment of the animals with AEMA depicted the restoration of these parameters in serum and liver. Preliminary phytochemical screening was done which showed the presence of flavanoids. The restoration of the hepatic functioning which was made evident from the levels of the serum and tissue markers suggests the protective activity of M.arvensis which may be attributed to the presence of flavanoids.},

abstract={In present study, chemical and physical interaction studies were carried out between the drug dopamine HCl with lipids (cholesterol, lecithin) and surfactants (Span 20, 40, 80) and Tween 80 excipents. These excipients were an important constituent in designing liposomal drug delivery. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopical studies (FTIR) of drug showed no deviation in characteristic drug absorption peaks in presence of formulating excipients. O-H (Hydroxyl) and N-H (amine group) stretching vibrations and C-H bending vibrations (methyl group) of drug was prominent in both drug and with excipients. This explicitly showed absence of interference in eliciting drug's pharmacodynamic properties. Differential scanning calorimetric study were also performed to determine the physical interaction among the drug, lipid and surfactant excipients. The liposomal formulations with and without surfactants showed complete absence of those pure lecithin endothermic peaks particularly its melting point peak. Other characteristic peaks of lecithin appears shifted to about 5-8 °C which indicates fluidization during the formation of lipid bilayers. The lecithin and cholesterol peak of surfactant liposomes showed very less or broad endothermic peak which is an indicative that surfactant have interacted well with the lipids during the formation of vesicles. Conversion of crystalline dopamine drug to amorphous was also proved in the differential scanning calorimetric studies.},

Particle swarm optimization (PSO) has been used to find the optimal machining parameters for minimizing machining time subjected to desired surface roughness. Physical constraints for both experiment and theoretical approach are cutting speed, feed, depth of cut, and surface roughness. It is observed that the machining time and surface roughness based on PSO are nearly same as that of the values obtained based on confirmation experiments; hence, it is found that PSO is capable of selecting appropriate machining parameters for turning operation. © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2010.},

abstract={The aim of the study was to develop a new strategy for the differentiation of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) derived from UCB into hepatocyte like cells and also to estimate the effects of combination of fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF 4) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) on hematopoietic stem cell differentiation. HSCs were isolated and purified by magnetic activated cell sorting. HSCs were induced to hepatocyte like cells under a 2-step protocol with combination of growth factors. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was performed to detect multiple genes related to hepatocyte like cells development and function. Hepatocyte like morphology was illustrated by inverted repeat microscope and the secretion of albumin and α- fetoprotein by these cells was confirmed by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Hepatocyte like cells was observed at the end of the protocol (days 14). These differentiated cells were observed to show high expression of genes related to hepatocytes (tryptophan 2, 3-dioxygenase [TO], glucose 6-phosphate [G6P], cytokeratin 18 [CK 18], albumin and α- fetoprotein [AFP]). The quantities of albumin and AFP at day 0 were low and upon differentiation the cells were able to produce albumin and AFP at high levels. Our results show a new strategy for differentiation in a short duration, using a combination of growth factors for the differentiation of umbilical cord blood derived HSC into hepatocyte like cells under certain in vitro conditions. After further studies this approach has the potency, for widespread cell replacement therapy for liver diseases. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={Atherosclerosis which results from gradual deposition of lipids in medium and large arteries is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Terminalia arjuna is a herb of Combretaceae family which contains hypolipidemic compounds and flavonoids with high antioxidative properties. This study was conducted to determine the effect of ethanolic fraction of T. arjuna on blood lipids and atherosclerosis in rabbits fed with high fat diet (HFD). Twenty New Zealand rabbits of either sex were randomly divided into five groups: the first two were normal diet group and HFD (21 fat) group and the remaining three groups received high cholesterol diet supplemented with standard drug (Atorvastatin 10mgkg-1 body weight), T. arjuna ethanolic fraction (100 and 200mgkg-1 body weight), respectively. The concentration of total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides (TGs), very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol was determined in rabbits at the start of the experiment, at the 14th, 30th days and at the end of the study. Anti-atherogenic index was calculated from the lipid profile of the rabbits before sacrifice. At the end of the experimental period, the aorta was removed for assessment of atherosclerotic plaques. Results show that T. arjuna significantly decreases TC, LDL and TG levels and increases HDL and lessens atherosclerotic lesion in aorta (P .05). Hence T. arjuna extract can effectively prevent the progress of atherosclerosis. This is likely due to the effect of T. arjuna on serum lipoproteins and its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Copyright © 2011 Saravanan Subramaniam et al.},

abstract={A mini-library of diversely substituted 2,4-diaryl-3-azabicyco[3.3.1]nonan- 9-one O-methyloximes and their N-methyl analogs were synthesized by a non-laborious, modified and an optimized Mannich condensation in good yields. Both the ring N-methylation and oxime O-methylation were employed by various methods; of them, the usage of tBuOK was found to be the superior in terms of good yield in short time. Stereochemistry of all the synthesized compounds was unambiguously established by their NMR spectral (1H, 13C, 1H-1H COSY, 1H-13C one and multiple bond COSY and NOESY) as well as single-crystal XRD studies. Irrespective of the nature and position of the substituents, all the synthesized oxime ethers of the bicyclic Mannich bases as well as their N-methyl analogs adopted the twin-chair conformation with equatorial orientations of all the substituents. All the synthesized oxime ethers were evaluated for their antioxidant property by DPPH radical scavenging method. According to the structure-activity correlations, compound 4y was found to be a lead molecule with the IC50 of 0.187 mg/mL. Thus, the present study exploits the scope of finding more active analogs by further optimization with the incorporation of more electron enriched alkoxy/amino and/or phenolic groups on the heterocycle as well as oxime ether pharmacophore. Most of the synthesized molecules were screened for their antituberculostic potency against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv by zone of inhibition method. Of them, 4w/5d and 4x showed very promising inhibition zones of 21 and 23 mm, respectively, which leads to the optimization of 4x by introducing various substituents on the O-benzyl moiety to enhance the antituberculostic potency. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Ethno pharmacological relevance: The plant Sesbania grandiflora (Fabaceae) is commonly known as "Sesbania" and "agathi" in ayurvedic system of medicine and reputed in the indigenous medicine in India. It is also known as "Agati Sesban" or "humming bird tree" in English. All parts of this unique plant are useful and have a wide spectrum of medicinal properties. The plant has various uses in folk and traditional medicines for headache, swellings, anemia, bronchitis, pains, liver disorders and tumors. Aim of the study: The objective of the present study was to explore the anticancer activity of the ethanol extract of Sesbania grandiflora against Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC)-bearing Swiss albino mice. Materials and methods: Anticancer activity of ethanol extract of Sesbania grandiflora (EESG) of both leaves and flowers were evaluated in Swiss albino mice against Ehrlich Ascites Carcinoma (EAC) cell line at the doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg body weight intraperitoneally. The extracts were administered for 14 consecutive days. Twenty-four hours of last dose and 18 h of fasting, the mice were sacrificed and the anticancer effect of EESG was assessed by evaluating tumor volume, viable and nonviable tumor cell count, tumor weight, hematological parameters and biochemical parameters of EAC bearing host. Results: Sesbania grandiflora extracts showed significant decrease in (p < 0.01) tumor volume, viable cell count, tumor weight and elevated the life span of EAC bearing mice. Hematological profile such as RBC, hemoglobin and lymphocyte count reverted to normal level in EESG treated mice. The extracts significantly (p < 0.05) decreased the levels of lipid peroxidation and significantly (p < 0.05) increased the levels of GSH, SOD and CAT. Conclusion: The results showed that the ethanol extract of Sesbania grandiflora was effective in inhibiting the tumor growth in ascitic models and that is comparable to 5-Fluorouracil. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

But being rich in minerals they could provide a good energy source for plants. Soil near Coal mines of Neyveli was taken and subject to treatment with effective microorganisms that have fertilizing, antibiotic, iron solubilising, sulphur solubilising and photosynthesis helping activities. The microbes helpful in plant photosynthesis were isolated after studying their effect on chlorophyll content and photosynthesis rate by increasing their load on leaves after Humic acid spray. Microorganisms, mainly bacteria, with the above activities were isolated, characterised and cultured. The mines soil and a normal garden soil were treated with these microbes and their effects on plant growth (Abelmoscus esculentus and Trigonella foenum) was analysed by measuring the root length and shoot length of the plants. Simultaneously the soil parameters like pH and EC and chemical factors like NPK content were measured after the treatment. The mining soil showed significant positive result on plant growth and also an improvement in the physical and chemical properties after the microbial treatment.},

abstract={Designing BH3-mimitics, that are capable of displacing BH3-peptides from BH3-binding groove of anti-apoptotic proteins, is a promising strategy to develop therapeutics of cancer chemotherapy. ABT-737, a BH3-mimitic shown to act as potent inhibitor of anti-apoptotic proteins, failed to clear the clinical trials due to its poor bioavailability. ABT-263, an analog of ABT-737, is shown as potent inhibitor with appreciable bioavailability. We have herein shown that ABT-737 docks on CYP3A4, a metabolic enzyme present in intestine of human beings, with stronger binding affinity than the binding affinity of ABT-263 with the enzyme. Based on the binding affinities and mode of interactions between the ligands and the enzymes, the differential bioavailability of the ABT-737 and ABT-263 is attributed to their pre-systemic metabolic reactions that are presumably different from each other.},

abstract={Michelia champaca Linn(Magnoliaceae) is used in folk medicine for the treatment of ulcers and it is main species of Michelia used for the treatment of gastric ulcers. However, there have been no reports regarding the anti-ulcer activity of Michelia champaca Linn extracts. Therefore, this study was carried out to evaluate the anti-ulcerogenic property of the alcoholic and aqueous extracts of leaves and flowers of Michelia champaca Linn. The anti-ulcer assays were performed using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)- aspirin induced ulcer. The effects of the extracts on gastric content volume, pH, total acidity, ulcer index and stomach using the pylorus ligated model were evaluated at a dose of 300mg/kg. In the aspirin induced ulcer model, it was observed that the treatment with Michelia champaca Linn extracts significantly reduced the gastric juice, total acidity, ulcer index and elevation in gastric pH. The results were comparable with the positive control cimetidine 50mg/kg. Further the results were confirmed using histopathological studies of the stomach. These results showed the anti-ulcerogenic property of Michelia champaca Linn extracts. The maximum efficacy was shown by the flower aqueous extract followed by leaf alcoholic, flower alcoholic and leaf aqueous extracts. © 2010 Medipoeia.},

abstract={The plant Plumbago zeylanica Linn. of Plumbaginaceae known as Chitraka/ Chitramoolam is a popular drug in Ayurveda and Siddha. The root of this plant finds place in several of the compound formulations of these systems of medicine, as one of the ingredients. The root being a vital component in these formulations, its quality and consistency is of prime importance. Plumbagin being the major bioactive chemical was used as a reference standard with which the HPTLC chromatogram obtained for each sample was compared. Plumbagin present in each sample was quantified using a calibration graph of the reference standard. The present study deals with the study of the presence of any variation in the plumbagin content due to change in season and storage. Sufficient quantities of root was collected during the month of July 2008 and stored at room temperature for the assay of Plumbagin. From August onwards every month, fresh root samples were also collected till June 2009. Simultaneous comparison of the fingerprints of n-hexane extract of the roots as well as estimation of plumbagin was done on the samples collected and the stored sample at room temperature using HPTLC technique. The plumbagin content showed a sharp decline from July 2008 to June 2009 on the stored root samples. The study established more concentration of Plumbagin constituent in February followed by January. The content was found to be very less in April. Hence the root may show more efficacy if collected in February. The technique is simple and cost effective.},

A compact band with Rf 0.42 was obtained for Terbinafine. Densitometric analysis was performed in absorbance mode at 223nm using Camag TLC scanner. Linear regression analysis revealed a good linear relationship (r2 =0.9997) between peak area and concentration in the range of 200-1000ng/spot.The method was validated for precision, recovery and robustness. The limit of detection and quantification was 1.204 ng/ spot and 3.648 ng /spot respectively. Terbinafine was subjected to acid, alkaline hydrolysis, oxidative, photochemical and thermal degradation and compound underwent degradation only under photo chemical condition when the standard drug was exposed to UV light. This method under statistical analysis proved a selective, repeatable and accurate analysis of the drug. This method can be used for quantitative analysis of Terbinafine in the bulk drug and in tablet formulation.},

abstract={This paper describes the diagnostic features, treatment, and subsequent clinical course of a 53-year-old male whose migraine headaches increasingly impaired his ability to master his professional daily routine, causing him to seek help at our clinic. After the patient was evaluated according to diagnosis principles of Traditional European, Traditional Indian, and Traditional Chinese Medicine, he received naturopathic treatment as recommended by these traditional medical systems, initially as an outpatient and later as an inpatient. The patient's clinical response to the various therapeutic approaches was largely favorable and continues to be so. This supports the usefulness of such methods in treating migraine headache. The philosophies and rationales of the diagnostic and treatment methods of the three traditional medical systems are discussed with regard to migraine headache, particularly with regard to migraine illness as suffered by our patient.

abstract={The aim of this study was to investigate the anticancer activity of fungal taxol against dimethyl benz(a)anthracene (DMBA)-induced mammary gland carcinogenesis in Sprague Dawley rats. After 90 days of tumor induction, fungal and commercial taxol were administered intraperitoneally once a week for four weeks. Tissues were analyzed for biochemical markers that included aspartate aminotransaminase (AST), alanine aminotransaminase (ALT), acid phosphatase (ACP), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and carcino embryonic antigen (CEA). Histopathological changes as well as immunohistochemical localization of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and immunoblot analysis of matrix metallo proteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) and proliferation cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) were analysed in the breast tissue. Rats treated with fungal taxol and commercial taxol showed significant reduction in all biochemical markers when compared to cancer bearing untreated rats. Similarly, the increased expressions of iNOS, MMP-2, MMP-9 and PCNA in cancer bearing untreated rats, were found to be significantly reduced in fungal taxol and commercial taxol treated groups of rats. Our results implicate a major role for fungal taxol in preventing mammary gland carcinogenesis. © 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

abstract={Drainages have characteristic pattern and life histories with youthful stage in hilly areas, mature stage in plains and old stage in the coastal zones. The deviations from their normal life histories, especially aberrations in their flow pattern in the form of various drainage anomalies have been inferred to be the indications of dominantly the Eustatic and Isostatic changes. This, especially after the advent of Earth Observing Satellites, has attracted the geoscientists from all over the world, for studying such drainage anomalies. In this connection, a study has been undertaken in parts of South India falling south of 14° south latitude to comprehensively map some drainage anomalies like deflected drainages, eyed drainages and compressed meanders and to evolve the tectonic scenario therefrom. The mapping of such mega drainage anomalies and the related lineaments/faults from the satellite digital data and the integration of such lineaments/faults with the overall lineament map of South India showed that the study area is marked by active N-S block faults and NE-SW sinistral and NW-SE dextral strike slip faults. Such an architecture of active tectonic grains indicates that the northerly directed compressive force which has originally drifted the Indian plate towards northerly is still active and deforming the Indian plate. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Molecular self-assembly is a natural process occurring in many pathological conditions including Alzheimer's disease. Mechanistic insight into the self-assembly of amyloid fibrils led to the discovery of an aromatic dipeptide (diphenylalanine, FF) which is present in the core structural motif of Alzheimer's beta amyloid polypeptide. FF dipeptide has been reported to form well-defined nanotubes, which has been envisaged as a potential beta strand breaker in combination with charged amino acids for treating Alzheimer's disease. For therapeutic applications, it becomes important to consider the influence of hydrophobicity, temperature, pH, salts, proteins and peptide concentration on the self-assembly process which is the main focus of the present work. In the current study, we have qualitatively evaluated the morphological changes of FF nanostructures under various experimental conditions by scanning electron microscopy. Fourier Transform Infra-Red studies confirmed intermolecular hydrogen bonding and presence of parallel beta sheet structures. The scanning electron micrographs show formation of FF nanotubes under various conditions. The dimensions of the self-assembled nanostructures were found to be strongly influenced by the substrate, temperature, pH, salts and proteins. FF nanostructures formed under all experimental conditions showed enhanced fluorescence with Thioflavin T confirming the presence of beta sheet structures. The formation of peptide nanotubes in the physiological experimental conditions makes them attractive tool for future bionanotechnological applications. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={Purpose: To investigate the expression of αA- and αB-crystallin and heat shock protein 70 (Hsp 70) during curcumin treatment of selenium-induced cataractogenesis in Wistar rat pups. Methods: Group I Wistar rat pups received only saline and served as the control. Group II Wistar rat pups were intraperitoneally injected with selenium (15 μM/kg bodyweight) to induce cataract. Group III Wistar rat pups also underwent selenium-induced cataract but were cotreated with 75 mg/kg body weight of curcumin (single oral dose). Group IV Wistar rat pups with selenium-induced cataract were post-treated with curcumin at the group III dosage 24 h after selenium administration. Group V Wistar rat pups with selenium-induced cataract were pretreated with curcumin at the group III dosage 24 h before selenium administration. Results: This study found higher levels of αA- and αB-crystallin and Hsp 70 in lenses injected with selenium alone (group II) than in control lenses (group I). Similar results were observed in the group III and IV lenses. In contrast, in group V, the presence of curcumin 24 h before selenium injection decreased the αA- and αB-crystallin and Hsp 70 levels to almost the same as those found in group I lenses. Conclusions: Curcumin suppressed the expression of selenite-induced αA- and αB-crystallin and Hsp 70, and may therefore suppress cataract formation in rat pups. © 2011 Molecular Vision.},

Hardware and software are developed for implementing the absorbance measurement and to calculate the Chloride concentration. There is statistically no significant difference between the results obtained with the developed Instrument and the Chloride Ion Selective Electrode (ISE). It is found that the Concentration of Chloride is well within that of World Health Organisation (WHO) certified values. The Correlation coefficient r= 0.99 (n=6) is obtained between the developed instrument and the Ion Selective Electrode method. The sensitivity and the precision are high enough to determine the concentration of Chloride ion without any significant interference.

The development in coastal area and subsequent population growth have given rise to problems such as erosion, sedimentation, saltwater intrusion, degradation of natural resources, etc. Satellite data has proved to be more appropriate for change detections quantifying and monitoring coastal zones compared to conventional sources. An attempt is being made to elucidate the effect of shoreline changes with reference to the spatial and field data observed along the Tharangampadi area. The base map was prepared on 1:50,000 scale for delineation and identification of shoreline changes. The spatial variability of shoreline changes are studied using IRS 1B LISS-II 1991, IRS 1C LISS-III 2004 and IRS P6 LISS-IV and IRS 1D PAN merge data 2006. The corresponding Survey of India toposheets of 1852, 1972 and survey and land record village map of 1918 also supplemented for this study. The kind and extent of shoreline changes were investigated by using GPS during ground truth verification. The results are analyzed and presented in this paper.

abstract={Vegetable oil has become more attractive recently because of its environmental benefits and better quality exhaust emission. A well-known transesterification process made biodiesel, pungam seed oil was selected for biodiesel production. Pungam seed oil is non-edible oil, thus, food versus fuel conflict will not arise if this is used for biodiesel production. A maximum of 75% biodiesel was produced with 20% methanol in the presence of 0.5% sodium hydroxide. The experimental investigations were carried out in an engine that is coupled with an eddy current dynamometer. The engine is a single cylinder water-cooled, direct injection diesel engine developing a power output of 3.7 kW at 1500 rev/min. The crank angle encoder measured the engine speed, whereas the piezo electric sensors measured the cylinder pressure and the fuel injection pressure. The experimental investigations were carried out for bio-diesel and diesel and the results were compared. From the experimental results, it is concluded that the use of bio-diesel as an alternative fuel leads to significant reduction in emissions and improved performance of diesel engines. This paper discusses the production process of biodiesel from Pungam seed oil and its performance in the compression ignition engine. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.},

abstract={Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is a variation occurring in the single nucleotide of the genome. It is more precise to call it a point mutation. A single nucleotide polymorphism occurring in the CFTR gene causes cystic fibrosis. It includes the upset of Cl- ion transport that in turn results in the absorption of Na+ ions by the cells of the respiratory tree. This absorption later happens to be the initiating factor for various pathogens to breed in the respiratory tract with the sticky mucus as a supporting medium. The various pathogens include Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas cepacia etc. These pathogens communicate among themselves in a complicated way and organize into micro colonies so that they are able to pose an effective threat to the human defense mechanisms. This inter communication among pathogens is made possible by a complex and sensitive mechanism known as "Quorum Sensing" which involves micro molecules called "autoinducers". As a result of quorum sensing, the gene expressions within the pathogens are altered which enable the pathogen to diversify their virulence expression. The diversification of virulence factors leads to various hardships in the process of drug designing and targeting. Moreover several antimicrobial therapy and prophylaxis have been discovered in the past so as to safeguard the human race from the jaws of cystic fibrosis but all in vain. Present study focuses towards the proposal of an effective idea for this biological problem. This could be possible by making the concepts of chemistry join hands with bio-informatics so that a novel technique called "Chem-informatics" emerges. It is rather optimistic to trust on this emerging methodology so that something useful to the mankind may be contributed in the near future not only for cystic fibrosis but also for the rest of the diseases that swivel around the Homo sapiens.},

abstract={The effect of incorporating carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in the gel matrix on the electrophoretic mobility of proteins based on their molecular weight differences was investigated using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). More specifically, a reduction in standard deviation in the molecular weight calibration plots by 55% in the case of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and by 34% in the case of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) compared with that of pristine polyacrylamide gels was achieved after incorporating an insignificant amount of functionalized CNTs into the gel matrix. A mechanism based on a more uniform pore size distribution in CNT modified polyacrylamide gel matrix is proposed. Furthermore, the impact of SWCNTs and MWCNTs on the mobility of proteins in different molecular weight regimes at a given acrylamide concentration offers a tunable gel matrix in terms of the selection of molecular weight ranges of proteins. The robustness and excellent reproducibility of the CNT-PAGE protocol are expected to have a significant impact on the molecular weight determination of newly isolated proteins. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The polyetherimides were characterized by IR, 1H-NMR, X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, dielectric constants, solution viscosity and solubility. Polyetherimides were soluble in polar approtic solvents and improved solubility in common organic solvents is due to the presence of flexible groups in the polymer backbone. Polyetherimides exhibited good thermal stability and the temperature at which 10% weight loss occurs in the range 357-453°C in a nitrogen atmosphere.

abstract={A predictive method, based on artificial neural network (ANN) has been developed to study absorbance and pH effects on the equilibrium of blood serum. This strategy has been used to analyze serum samples and to predict the calcium concentration in blood serum. A dedicated data acquisition system is designed and fabricated using a LPC2106 microcontroller with light emitting diode (LED) as source and photodiode as sensor to measure absorbance and to calculate the calcium concentration. A multilayer neural network with back propagation (BP) training algorithm is used to simulate different concentration of calcium (Ca2+) as a function of absorbance and pH, to correlate and predict calcium concentration. The computed calcium concentration by neural network is quite satisfactory with correlations R2 = 0.998 and 0.995, standard errors of 0.0127 and 0.0122 in validation and testing stages respectively. Statistical analysis are carried out to check the accuracy and precision of the proposed ANN model and validation of results produce a relative error of about 3%. These results suggest that ANN can be efficiently applied and is in good agreement with values obtained with the current clinical spectrophotometric methods. Hence, ANN can be used as a complementary tool for studying metal ion complexion, with special attention to the blood serum analysis. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The east coast of India is more prone to natural hazards like cyclones, storm surges, and, in recent times, a new hazard in the form of tsunami. A tsunami, on the other hand, has nothing to do with atmospheric disturbances. Tsunamis were recorded during 1881, 1883, 1941, 1945, and 2004 along the coast of India (Chadha et al. 2005). The December 26, 2004, tsunami was the most disastrous and caused heavy loss of life and property. The tsunami triggered due to undersea mega thrust earthquake that occurred with an epicenter at N 3.7° and E 90° with a magnitude of MW 9.3, near the west coast of Sumatra, Indonesia, and is referred to as the Sumatra-Andaman earthquake (Lay et al. 2005). The devastating tsunami killed over 230,000 people in 14 countries. This second largest tsunami had an impact of sudden changes in the geomorphology and geomorphological processes along the east coast of Tamil Nadu, India. This has resulted in transformation in the coastal landforms and quality of life as well. The catastrophic event has eroded the beach, foreshore, and backshore areas and completely generated new outlook in the coastal geomorphology, thereby resulting in the need of new sets of coastal management practices. Many coastal morphological changes have occurred all over the world in response to the December 26, 2004, tsunami (Ella et al. 2006). Nagapattinam district in the east coast of India, located in Tamil Nadu state, is one of the areas that was severely affected by the 2004 tsunami waves (Ramasamy et al. 2005). The severity of damage varies depending on the location of the villages, altitude above mean sea level (MSL), presence of sand dunes, and the distance from the coast. © 2011 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={The introduction of pervasive devices and mobile devices has led to immense growth of real time distributed processing. In such context reliability of the computing environment is very important. Reliability is the probability that the devices, links, processes, programs and files work efficiently for the specified period of time and in the specified condition. Distributed systems are available as conventional ring networks, clusters and agent based systems. Reliability of such systems is focused. These networks are heterogeneous and scalable in nature. There are several factors, which are to be considered for reliability estimation. These include the application related factors like algorithms, data-set sizes, memory usage pattern, input-output, communication patterns, task granularity and load-balancing. It also includes the hardware related factors like processor architecture, memory hierarchy, input-output configuration and network. The software related factors concerning reliability are operating systems, compiler, communication protocols, libraries and preprocessor performance. In estimating the reliability of a system, the performance estimation is an important aspect. Reliability analysis is approached using probability. © 2005 - 2011 JATIT & LLS. All rights reserved.},

abstract={A linear heating system has been developed using field programmable gate array (FPGA) for the measurement of thermoluminescence (TL) in alkali halides and other related compounds. Thermoluminescence plays an essential part in radiation dosimetry. This system measures the temperature and the amount of light emitted by the sample for TL studies. This work proposed an architectural framework, verilog HDL code for protocols for reading temperature from Thermocouple through ADC, processing of data (amount of light energy) in FPGA, sending control signal to the heater and displaying the temperature in LCD. This work shows performance improvement 3 times in comparison with conventional embedded system. The power consumption is also comparatively lower.},

The proposed feature selection method is Maximum Difference Feature Selection (MDFS). Digital mammography is reliable method for early detection of breast cancer. The most important step in breast cancer diagnosis is feature selection. Computer automated feature selection is reliable and also it helps to improve the classification accuracy. GLCM (Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix) features are extracted from the mammogram. The extracted features are selected based on a proposed MDFS method. Experiments have been conducted on datasets from DDSM (Digital database for Screening Mammography) database. Several feature selection methods are available. The accuracy of the model depends on the relevant feature selection. The proposed MDFS method selects only essential features and eliminates the irrelevant features. The experiment results show that neural network based model with proposed feature selection method improved the classification accuracy. © 2005 - 2011 JATIT & LLS. All rights reserved.},

abstract={There are several efficient methods for the discovery or mining of various types of data, methods devised for mining textual static web content have always been proved less efficient due to the data's ambiguous, unclassified, unstructured or unclustered nature. Various association rule mining algorithms like Generalized pattern algorithm are being implemented to mine the web content but again due to the above setbacks the efficiency expected from the algorithm is not obtained. Since the dip in the efficiency of these algorithms is amounted to the nature of the textual web content, an algorithm which may deal with, if not all the anomalies at least the unclustered nature of the content may increase the efficiency drastically. This paper emphasizes the same point, making the assumptions that the web content is static and there is at least one common pattern found in the given datasets. © 2005 - 2011 JATIT & LLS.

abstract={Present complexity of System on Chip (SOC) has brought new challenges in low power design and testing. This shows that huge test pattern and its corresponding switching activity are one of the major problems. Due to this large number of test patterns the data transition time is also increased. More switching is also proportional to more number of transitions. This paper considers the problem of switching activity in scan based test pattern. This proposed approach is based on reducing the huge switching activity by partitioning the test vectors into groups. The number of transition is identified in each partition group. The groups having zero transition have lesser switching activities, so they are not considered equally with transition group for testing. Thus the test run time and number of switching is minimized. This in turn reduces the power consumption for testing. The proposed technique tested on ISCAS89 shows the significant reduction in overall switching activity of the test pattern. © 2005 - 2011 JATIT & LLS.},

abstract={Wireless Sensor Networks utilize large numbers of Wireless Sensor nodes to forward information from source to destination. Wireless Sensor Nodes are battery-powered devices. Energy saving is always vital to maximize the lifetime of Wireless Sensor Network. Recently, there are many Routing Protocols have been designed and proposed for Wireless Sensor Networks to improve its performance in terms of Communication Time, Residual Energy and Energy Consumption and also these protocols addressed Reliability and Shortest path. In this paper, this research work has implemented various Routing Protocols namely Power Efficient Data Gathering and Aggregation Protocol (PEDAP), Power Efficient Data Gathering and Aggregation Protocol-Power Aware (PEDAP-PA), Energy Efficient Spanning Tree approach (EESR), and Localized-Power Efficient Data Gathering and Aggregation Protocol (L-PEDAP) are studied thoroughly. From the experimental results, it is revealed that L-PEDAP outperforms PEDAP, PEDAP-PA and EESR in terms of Bandwidth, Resource Utilization and Communication Reliability. However, L-PEDAP fails to minimize the Energy Consumption and Communication Time due to Dynamic Routing Mechanisms. The PEDAP achieves less Communication Time to forward packets to destination. However, it fails to achieve Power-Aware Reliable Communication. From this analysis, it is observed that for faster communication, PEDAP could be used and for reliable communication with high bandwidth utilization, L-PEDAP is the best Routing Protocol in Wireless Sensor Networks. © 2005 - 2011 JATIT & LLS.},

abstract={Extracting previously unknown patterns from huge volume of data is the primary objective of any data mining algorithm. In recent days there is a tremendous growth in data collection due to the advancement in the field of information technology. The patterns revealed by data mining algorithm can be used in various domains like Image Analysis, Marketing and weather forecasting. As a side effect of the mining algorithm some sensitive information is also revealed. There is a need to preserve the privacy of individuals which can be achieved by using privacy preserving data mining. In this paper we propose a new approach to preserve sensitive information using fuzzy logic. First we perform clustering on the original data set then we add noise to the numeric data using a fuzzy membership function that results in distorted data. Set of Clusters generated using the distorted data is also relative to the original cluster as well as privacy is also achieved. It is also proved that the number of iterations for performing the clustering process is less in our approach when compared with the traditional approach. © 2005 - 2011 JATIT & LLS.},

This Core monitors the HHO generator with sensors and its accessories continuously measuring the vehicle engine performance. From this design the fuel utility is reduced from 15% to 30% which minimizes the carbon deposition in the cylinder thereby increasing the changing period of engine oil, it also improves the efficiency of the engine and the life span.

abstract={Internet introduced sweeping changes in communication and information Technology. Information super highway linked every nook and corner of this world and flow of information brought down and almost eliminated the time spent in searching and sifting information. The benefits are endless. In recent years the interest of connecting small embedded devices to the IP networks has increased. In order to communicate over Internet the TCP/IP protocol stack is required. Unfortunately, for most electronic devices, implementing the technology to achieve this networking connectivity based on open Internet standards does not come easily. For example, most household appliances are based on very low-cost 8-bit controller technology and chances are that the host MCU includes neither a network port nor the hardware resources to support TCP/IP and other Internet protocols without disrupting their primary function. So, the normal TCP/IP way of implementation will fail. Here we have to incorporate certain optimization techniques for developing small TCP/IP stack. The usage of this stack is for Remote data acquisition and control systems, and many more utilities. [1],[2],[4], © 2005 - 2011 JATIT & LLS. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Mesoporous materials (2-50 nm) have generated much interest due to its multi-faceted applications as catalysts, adsorbents and drug delivery systems. This study is the first of its kind to systematically investigate the effect of polyhydric solvents on the morphology, catalytic and adsorption properties of self-oriented mesoporous silica. Three different mesoporous SBA-15 silica materials were synthesized using Water (SW), Glycerol (SG) and Ethylene Glycol (SEG) as solvent. They were characterized using FE-SEM, HR-TEM, small angle XRD, FT-IR, BET and solid state NMR. Morphological studies such as pore characteristics, surface area and the functionalization were carried out by comparing their catalytic and adsorption properties. Each mesoporous sample was used to catalyze biodegradable aliphatic polyester synthesis namely poly (butylene succinate), poly (butylene pimelate) and poly (butylene sebacate) and compared with a conventional homogeneous catalyst SnCl2.2H 2O. The results offered higher purity and yield of polyesters and they took the order as SW&lt;SG&lt;SEG. The adsorption efficiency of each mesoporous sample was compared using the fluorescent dye Rhodamine-B and it took a reverse order (SEG&lt;SG&lt;SW) to that of the catalytic efficiency. This difference may be attributed to the difference in free active sites, ordered morphology of pores and surface area. The synthesized polyesters were characterized using FT-IR, 1H NMR, XRD, GPC, DSC and the adsorption studies, using UV-Visible spectrophotometer. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.},

abstract={Reliability is an important aspect in the distributed system studies and developments. Distributed processes are an instance of a running program, which are either concurrent or parallel. The distributed processes exhibit more dynamism. The processes also have peculiar characteristics like message passing, load sharing, fault tolerance, fault resilience and recovery. The program reliability analysis encounters a variety of distributed programs. These programs reside in several nodes. Each program has a composite structure. The functions and data are composite. In order to perform reliability analysis of distributed programs the programs are run in the distributed computing environment. Studying and analyzing the programs derive the configuration of the programs by reduction. The program code is read and analyzed by the analyzer program. The program flow is checked. Then the appropriate program flow graph is derived. It is then classified into one of serial configured, parallel configured program or mixed configured program. Once configured, the system can be evaluated perfectly. Reliability of such a system can be easily evaluated by taking into account the reliability of independent components. © 2005 - 2011 JATIT & LLS. All rights reserved.},

After identifying the speaking face, clustering of those faces is a difficult task. The difficulty is in extracting the exact speaking faces and clustering them. In the existing techniques, lip movement of a character is taken as Region Of Interest (ROI) for identifying the faces in the films. For clustering those faces, the k-means clustering technique is used. By using the above technique, retrieval of speaking faces cannot produce an accurate result. So, in this paper, lip movement as ROI and IRIS recognition for clustering of speaking faces are used.

Long Term Evolution (LTE) is next generation mobile communication standard from 3GPP, it is based on OFDMA) in Downlink Transmission and SC-FDMA in uplink Transmission. SC-FDMA is based on Frequency Division Multiple Access scheme. When compared with other multiple access scheme, it deals with the multiple users in a shared communication systems. SC-FDMA is also called as linearly pre-coded OFDMA, in the sense it has the additional discrete time Fourier transform (DFT) processing in SC-FDMA. The main advantage of SC-FDMA over OFDMA is low Peak to average power ratio, so the power transmission is low when compared. This work proposes a run time reconfiguration architecture for the SCFDMA. Where the bandwidth and sub carrier mapping schemes of SC-FDMA can be changed.

Evaluation of the Vandermonde's determinant leads to prime factorization of a composite number. These prime numbers are employed as radix numbers for cyclic code of individual keys. Parity check and checksum are combined with the cyclic code for additional security. The session key for transaction is done using the expansion of Vandermonde's determinant, which is secured from indoor and outdoor attacks by proper establishment, management and agreement of the protocol.

abstract={Nanofibrous scaffolds are very promising physical guidance substrates for regenerating nerves to traverse larger nerve gaps. In this study, we have attempted to develop 2D random and 3D longitudinally oriented nanofibers of poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) by the modified electrospinning process and characterized the surface morphology, mechanical properties, porosity, degradation and wettability. The orientation of aligned fibers was optimized by varying the speed of the rotating mandrel in the electrospinning process. The mean diameter of random PLGA nanofibers was 197 ± 72 nm, whereas that of the aligned PLGA fiber was 187 ± 121 nm. The pore size of aligned PLGA nanofibers (3.5 ± 1.1 νm) was significantly lower than their respective random nanofibers (8.0 ± 2.0 νm) (p < 0.05). However, the percentage porosity of both scaffolds was comparable (p > 0.05). The mass loss percentage and molecular weight loss percentage due to degradation was higher in random PLGA fibers when compared to aligned PLGA after 5 weeks (p < 0.05). The tensile strength and Young's modulus of random PLGA fibers were significantly higher than those of the aligned PLGA nanofibers (p < 0.05). Both random and longitudinally aligned scaffolds were used for the in vitro culture of Schwann cells. Morphology and cell proliferation results demonstrated that the aligned fibers assist the direction of Schwann cells and a better proliferation rate than their random fibers. The results confirmed that aligned nanofibers have better deformability, slow degradation, comparable porosity and orientation cues than random nanofibers. Hence the longitudinally aligned nanofibers may be ideal scaffolds for nerve regeneration. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The increasing Design for Test (DfT) area overhead and potential performance degradation is caused due to wrapping all the embedded cores for modular System-on-Chip (SoC) testing. This paper proposes a solution for reducing the number of Wrapper Boundary Register (WBR) cells. By utilizing the WBRs of the surrounding cores to transfer test stimuli and responses, the WBRs of some cores can be removed without affecting the testability of the SoC. We denote the cores without WBRs as light-wrapped cores and present a new modular SoC test architecture for concurrently testing both the wrapped and the lightwrapped logic cores. Since the WBRs of cores that transfer test stimuli and test responses for light-wrapped cores become shared resources during test, conflicts arise during test scheduling that will negatively impact the test application time. The algorithm for SoC test scheduling and light-wrapped logic cores works under multiple constraints (test power dissipation, test resources and test priorities) and applies a Power Swarm optimization based optimum search for a solution to the scheduling problem. We consider the experiments on several SoC benchmark circuits and demonstrate that, with an acceptable increase in test application time, the number of WBRs can be significantly decreased. © 2005-2011 JATIT & LLS.

Biosorption studies are carried out through various parameters such as adsorbent dosage, pH and contact time. Removal of heavy metal ions from the textile dye effluent increases with increase in adsorbent dosage. In ARH, at 50 g/L the maximum of 62%, 68% and 65% removal of Zn(II), Cu(II) and Cr(VI) are obtained respectively, whereas, in ACF, at 50 g/L the maximum of 64%, 67% and 72% removal of Zn(II), Cu(II) and Cr(VI) are obtained respectively. In the effect of pH, the maximum removal of metal ions occurs at pH 1-3 for both the adsorbents. In contact time, the maximum removal of heavy metal ions is observed at optimum time of 300 min. The maximum removal of heavy metal ions from the textile dye effluent using ARH and ACF is evaluated successfully through the percentage of seed germination of Vigna mungo L with the treated adsorbents. On comparison, ACF is good adsorbent when compared with ARH.},

abstract={Vibrio cholerae has a very peculiar quorum sensing mechanism working at a low cell density observed with respect to biofilm formation and virulence factors production in contrast to other Vibrio species where quorum sensing works at higher cell density. There are two basic mechanism along with an unknown mechanism involved in this quorum sensing, that is, production of Cholera Autoinducer-1 (CAI-1) whose synthesis depends on CqsA sensed by CqsS and Autoinducer-2 (AI-2) synthesized by luxS interacting with luxP/Q sensors, responsible for intraspecies and interspecies communication respectively. These interaction results in exopolysaccharide production [EPS] leading to biofilm formation triggering virulence gene expression. Thus, the appropriate environment adapted by these aquatic pathogenic organisms causes a differential shift in the cell-tocell communication making it as an essential aspect for understanding. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

abstract={The rapid emergence of microbes that resist most commonly used and even newly developed antibiotics has emphasized the need for the development of new strategy against infectious diseases. As similar to many opportunistic pathogens Vibrio cholerae also rely on Quorum sensing (QS), a bacterial cell-to-cell communication system for biofilm formation and virulence character expressions. Since the QS is crucial for execution of pathogenesis called Quorum quenching or Anti-pathogenic approach which will be the promising alternative strategy to contain infectious diseases that abolishes the communication networks. As QS does not unswervingly involved in the elementary processes of bacterial growth, inhibition of QS does not enforce harsh selective pressure which brings forth resistance as like as with antibiotics. This article discussed about diverse possible targets of Quorum quenching of Vibrio cholerae for the attenuation of Quorum sensing. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={While the 3-phase Induction Motor has been the conventional choice for drive applications over the years. It has presented certain problems from the control point of view. These are mainly lack of variable speed over wide range and lack of independent control of torque and speed. The advent of field oriented control along with advances in power electronics and online computational hardware has removed this disadvantage. Accordingly, high performance drives using plain cage induction motor have been successfully put into operation for many applications. One popular implementation of field oriented control is the indirect field orientation which depends on a sufficiently accurate mathematical model of the machine including parameter values. In this context, the variation of rotor resistance during the operational and environmental causes is an issue since maintaining the field orientation against detuning effects of rotor resistance variation is important. In view of this, estimation of rotor resistance has been a live area of research during the last decades. This review paper attempt to present important research outcomes in this topic for the benefit of researchers and professionals. © 2011 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.},

Our scheme does not require a special voting channel and communication can occur entirely over the current Internet. This method integrates the Internet convenience and cryptology. This paper analyzes the various existing protocols such as simple protocol, Two Agency protocol, Blind Signature Protocol and Sensus Protocol. In the existing protocol the Tallier has to wait until the decryption key is received from the voter. So it will consume lot of time. Instead of getting the decryption key value from the voter, the Tallier maintains the key information securely in the database. So, comparatively the proposed protocol consumes less time. This paper also analyzes the various security issues involved in an electronic voting like security, privacy, authentication, anonymous, uniqueness, accuracy, fairness, efficiency and enforceability. © 2005 - 2011 JATIT & LLS.

abstract={X-ray radiography is commonly used in (NDT) Non-destructive Testing, for identifying defects in weld. When the X-ray is passed through the weld object, the area where the defects are occurred will be having different intensity profile, than the nearby pixels. Most of the X-ray radiographic images will be having some forms of noise components embedded in it. Median filter is applied for noise removal, followed by gamma correction for image enhancement which made the image more operative. For the segmentation of the weld defect, watershed method is performed. Through watershed segmentation process, the defective regions are segmented out, without oversegmentation problem. Standard derivation and mean of the Projection Profile of the radiographic image along with RST invariants features are used for feature extraction. In this work, we fed the feature extracted to a Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) for training, with four different output classes, where each class corresponds to different classes or types of weld defects like Cluster Porosity, Slag inclusions, Lack of Penetration (LOP) and Burn-Through. The result shows that the proposed system is highly efficient in classifying different types of weld defects. © 2005 - 2011 JATIT & LLS. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Wi-Fi, a Wireless Local Area Network technology has solely conquered the arena of short range wireless broadband systems. To support the existing system and to further enhance the measure of performance in multi path fading environment, Wi-Fi technology is intertwined with space diversity technique which is implemented using Alamouti coding and is then introduced with interleaving/scrambling technique to take the benefit of time diversity. Diversity technique has been an essential factor in improving the quality of the wireless system's operation by providing performance almost equivalent to that of the least distorted path among various multi paths at any given time and thereby accounting for the fading effect caused in corruptive communication channels. This paper discusses the performance of space diversity techniques in Wi-Fi by comparing their Bit Error Rate (BER).

abstract={Context Based Binary Arithmetic Coding (CBAC) is a part of JZ profile of Audio Video Coding Standard (AVS).The goal of this paper is to present the efficient hardware based binary arithmetic coder which is the main part of binarisation involved in CBAC of AVS. This paper explains about the efficient arithmetic coding involved in the video transcoding. The major concerns of using JZ profile of AVS is movie compression for high-density storage and relatively higher computational complexity can be tolerated at the encoder side to provide higher video quality. This arithmetic coder avoids the slow multiplication, here the traditional arithmetic calculation is transformed to software domain using log. The proposed arithmetic engine will give high compression gain and an efficient coding design for handling the high resolution video sequence. This is used for the effective pipelining process and increase the overall processing speed. The implementation of arithmetic coder in CABAC (Context Adaptive Binary Arithmetic Coding) architecture is satisfying the CBAC feature. The study of this paper is required to know about the process of efficient AC(arithmetic coding) and the hardware based arithmetic engine in CBAC. The CBAC engine is implemented on Xilinx Virtex-5 ML501 Board. The synthesis and simulation results are presented.

abstract={In recent years, vector control schemes for induction motor drive systems have gained wide acceptance in high performance applications. Vector Control transforms the control of an induction motor to that of a separately excited dc motor by creating independent channels for flux and torque control. The success of the vector control scheme is the knowledge of the instantaneous position of rotor flux. The position of the rotor flux is measured in the direct vector control scheme and estimated in the indirect vector control scheme. This requires a prior knowledge of the machine parameters which makes the indirect vector control scheme machine parameter dependent especially rotor resistance. MRAS based rotor resistance estimation is simpler and easy to design. In this paper, the vector controlled drive with Neural Learning Algorithm based MRAS rotor resistance estimator is designed and validated through MATLAB/SIMULINK simulation and compared with Conventional MRAS. The performance of the vector controlled drive is analyzed extensively and the performance of the estimator is also analyzed in terms of accuracy and settling time. The promising results obtained are presented. © 2011 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.},

abstract={Without an iota of doubt, the healthcare industry is the largest one across the globe not only in market value but also in profusely and powerfully applying a bevy of robust and resilient information and communication technologies (ICT) in order to do away with scores of manual tasks. As known widely, manual implementation and operation are liable for errors and faults. Being a life-critical domain, every promising and potential technology is being readily recognized and rewarded in the healthcare field. Precisely speaking, the hot healthcare field has become the dominant and prominent ICT-driven discipline today and tomorrow is still brighter. Electronics and instrumentation disciplines are also tremendously contributing for the unprecedented success and growth of the healthcare domain. The extensive leverage and usage of competent techniques, tips and tools for bringing in comprehensive and compact automation, optimization, and transformation in the healthcare landscape has been going successfully for a long time now. And this positive and progressive trend is all set to go further broader and deeper with the easy availability on-demand, online, dynamic, real-time, and adaptive computing systems. The prevailing trend clearly indicates that there would be myriad dramatic and drastic changes in the healthcare field with the insights-driven adoption of information technology (IT) and nanotechnology together and hence the ensuing healthcare systems would be cognition-attached, cloud-based, process-centric, service-oriented and knowledge-driven. With the persistent increase in aging population especially in developed countries, heightened healthcare costs, error-prone healthcare operations and the maturity and stability of medical care technologies, ITenabled medical care is all set to reach newer heights in the days to unfold. This paper describes a prototype medical system, which could effectively monitor any patient's health parameters such as pulse, blood pressure etc., administer salubrious drugs automatically and inform the doctor and the caretaker about the current conditions of the patient in time. All kinds of interactions are controlled ubiquitously by using an Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) system. The Open Service Gateway Initiative (OSGi) standard and one of its open source implementation is prescribed as the middleware for effectively discovering, connecting, and mediating all kinds of Ambient Sensor devices. In order to deliver the prescribed drugs dynamically to the patient, a new device has been freshly designed and we have named it as "Ubiquitous Drug Injector (UDI)". In addition to this, a pervasive device is being provided for each patient and this device could receive inputs from the ambient devices and enable in correctly inferring the condition of the patient. The insights retrieved, processed and analyzed facilitate in administering appropriate drugs well in time. The whole system designed and prototyped is a highly scalable healthcare system with varying control flows. This work lays a strong and sustainable foundation in evolving novel techniques for nextgeneration healthcare. ©2005 - 2011 JATIT and LLS.},

abstract={An Ad hoc network is a collection of mobile hosts without any fixed infra structure or a centralized administrator. Each node will act by itself as a router. These type of networks are heterogeneous in nature, i.e., with different communication characteristics. The nodes build the routing table statically as well as on-demand and therefore they exhibit hybrid nature in routing. The nodes are grouped together called cluster and each group is monitored by a cluster head during data transmission. The routing is performed either by inter-clustering where the source node and destination node belongs to different clusters or by intra-clustering where the source node and destination node belong to same cluster. In this paper, we have introduced a new term called Partial Authority Node (PAN) which shares the load form cluster head and thereby performs intra-cluster routing efficiently. Also a gateway node or a border node (BN) is available for inter-cluster routing to trace the destination easily. So, most of the load is shared by PAN and BN. The algorithm is evaluated by making simulations in ns2 and the results shows the increased performance in terms of throughput and hence it provides a better quality of service. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.},

abstract={In this paper a novel steganographic method has been proposed to improve the security of embedded data with high capacity and imperceptible visual quality, the proposed method is based on four-pixel block differencing, modified LSB substitution and Knights tour. Secret data is embedded randomly using knights tour in each 8×8 pixels block of cover image and n-bit modified LSB substitution has been used to improve the quality of stego image, where n is decided by the level to which the average difference value falls into, then it employs readjustment procedure to reduce the perceptual distortion. The proposed method adaptively embeds the secret data into cover image by differentiating the edge and smooth areas, so that more number of secret bits can be embedded without making any perceptual distortion. Results show that our proposed method has provided greater security with high embedding capacity and a better image quality. © 2005 - 2011 JATIT & LLS. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In this paper we study the implementation of Multi-cost routing for Mobile Ad hoc networks where the end-to-end security is provided which is almost not found in traditional approach. A routing table is maintained with the one hop neighbour using AOMDV algorithm and each node is loaded with a maximum energy. Public key and Private keys are generated by RSA algorithm and the public key is exchanged between the sender and the receiver. Though this process is time consuming, it is very efficient; as encrypted and secured routing is performed by checking and verifying the certificates (using MD5 algorithm) by the respective nodes. This process consumes less energy and thereby it saves the battery life time, which is a major issue in ad hoc networks. This work is implemented in ns2 and the results have been analyzed in terms of delay, throughput, residual energy and packet delivery ratio. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.},

This method integrates Internet convenience and cryptology. In the existing protocols either the tallier has to wait for the decryption key from voter till the voting process is over or the verification process has to wait until the election is over. But in the proposed single transaction voting protocol the entire voting process as well as the verification process is done in a single transaction compared to multiple transactions in the existing protocol. The advantage of single transaction is that it consumes less time that results in overall speeding up the voting process. It is shown that the proposed scheme satisfies the more important requirements of any e-voting scheme: completeness, correctness, privacy, security and uniqueness. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.},

abstract={The performance of ad hoc routing protocols will significantly degrade when there are faulty nodes in the network. The fault tolerant routing protocol addresses this problem by exploring the network redundancy through multipath routing. In this paper, it is proposed to design a fault tolerant multi path routing protocol to reduce the packet loss due to route breakage. In this protocol, nodes determine multiple disjoint routes having more battery power and residual energy, to every active destination. In fault-tolerant mechanism, the received signal strength is measured and based on its value, it can send warning packets to the previous node. When a downstream node encounters a forwarding error, an upstream node with the same data in its buffer and alternative route can retransmit the data. Simulation results show that the proposed protocol achieves better throughput and packet delivery ratio with reduced delay, packet drop and energy. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.},

abstract={Aromatase is an important pharmacological target in the anti-cancer therapy as the intratumoral aromatase is the source of local estrogen production in breast cancer tissues. Suppression of estrogen biosynthesis by aromatase inhibition represents an effective approach for the treatment of hormone-sensitive breast cancer. Because of the membrane-bound character and heme-binding instability, no crystal structure of aromatase was reported for a long time, until recently when crystal structure of human placental aromatase cytochrome P450 in complex with androstenedione was deposited in PDB. The present study is towards understanding the structural and functional characteristics of aromatase to address unsolved mysteries about this enzyme and elucidate the exact mode of binding of aromatase inhibitors. We have performed molecular docking simulation with twelve different inhibitors (ligands), which includes four FDA approved drugs; two flavonoids; three herbal compounds and three compounds having biphenyl motif with known IC50 values into the active site of the human aromatase enzyme. All ligands showed favorable interactions and most of them seemed to interact to hydrophobic amino acids Ile133, Phe134, Phe221, Trp224, Ala306, Val370, Val373, Met374 and Leu477 and hydrophilic Arg115 and neutral Thr310 residues. The elucidation of the actual structure-function relationship of aromatase and the exact binding mode described in this study will be of significant interest as its inhibitors have shown great promise in fighting breast cancer. © 2011 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.},

Correlations for the average Nusselt number are presented specifically for fluids with low Prandtl numbers pertaining to liquid metals.

abstract={Developing countries across the world have embraced the policy of high economic growth as a means to reduce poverty. This economic growth largely based on industrial output is fast degrading the ecosystems, jeopardizing their long term sustainability. Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) has long been recognized as a tool which can help in protecting the ecosystems and aid sustainable development. The Screening guidelines for EIA reflect the level of commitment the nation displays towards tightening its environmental protection system. The paper analyses the screening process for EIA in India and dissects the rationale behind the exclusions and thresholds set in the screening process. The screening process in India is compared with that of the European Union with the aim of understanding the extent of deviations from a screening approach in the context of better economic development. It is found that the Indian system excludes many activities from the purview of screening itself when compared to the EU. The constraints responsible for these exclusions are discussed and the shortcomings of the current command and control system of environmental management in India are also explained. It is suggested that an ecosystem carrying capacity based management system can provide significant inputs to enhance the effectiveness of EIA process from screening to monitoring. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Purpose: To develop and validate a dissolution test method for dissolution release of artemether and lumefantrine from tablets. Methods: A single dissolution method for evaluating the in vitro release of artemether and lumefantrine from tablets was developed and validated. The method comprised of a dissolution medium of 1000 ml of 2%w/v of Myrj 52 in 0.005M HCl per vessel with the paddle rotating at 100 rpm for 120 min. The dissolution samples were analysed using a Waters HPLC system with Waters symmetry column (C-18 column of 250mm x 4.6mm i.d., 5 μ particle size). The mobile phase was a mixture of 20 volumes of 0.5%v/v of triethylamine in water (adjusted to a pH of 3.0 with orthophosphoric acid) and 80 volumes of acetonitrile. The detection wavelength was set at 216 nm and 100 μl of each sample was injected. The HPLC method used for the determination of drug release was validated for the parameters of accuracy, precision, linearity, specificity, filter validation, solution stability and robustness. Results: The dissolution test provided sink conditions for artemether and lumefantrine and was able to discriminate between tablet formulations of different hardness and different composition. Application of Mann-Whitney U test for significant difference between samples at various time points during the dissolution test yielded z values > 1.96 (1.96 = critical z value at p = 0.05) for the various formulations tested, indicating the discriminatory power of the dissolution test. Conclusion: This validated dissolution test may be used as a single dissolution test for artemether and luminfantrine in tablet formulations. © Pharmacotherapy Group.},

abstract={The current problems in wireless systems are multi-path propagation, frequency selective fading, Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI) and Inter-Carrier Interference (ICI), with the major challenge being transmission of information having high data rates over long distances. The Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) systems solve a few of the above stated problems by the use of diversity schemes, which increase the reliability and security of the message. By adopting Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) and OFDM technologies, wireless systems could reach data rates up to several hundreds of Mbps and achieve spectral efficiencies of several tens of bits/Hz/s, which are unattainable for conventional Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) systems. This paper deals with the simulation of Space Time Frequency (STF) coded OFDM system. The coding schemes like Space Time (ST), Space Frequency (SF) and Space Time Frequency (STF) coding are compared and from the results it is proved that STF scheme performs better than ST and SF schemes. The Space Time Frequency coded communication system when is used along with diversity schemes like MIMO and Multiple Input Single Output (MISO) is compared for their performance over a fading channel having inherent noise, and it is further proved that MIMO performs better than MISO schemes. © 2005 - 2011 JATIT & LLS.

abstract={A mathematical model of steady state mono-layer potentiometric biosensor is developed. The model is based on non stationary diffusion equations containing a non linear term related to Michaelis-Menten kinetics of the enzymatic reaction. This paper presents a complex numerical method (He's variational iteration method) to solve the non-linear differential equations that describe the diffusion coupled with a Michaelis-Menten kinetics law. Approximate analytical expressions for substrate concentration and corresponding current response have been derived for all values of saturation parameter α and reaction diffusion parameter K using variational iteration method. These results are compared with available limiting case results and are found to be in good agreement. The obtained results are valid for the whole solution domain. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Objective: To evaluate the in vitro antifungal activity of Aegle marmelos leaf extracts and fractions on the clinical isolates of dermatophytic fungi like Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Trichophyton rubrum, Microsporum canis, Microsporum gypseum and Epidermophyton floccosum. Methods: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) of various extracts and fractions of the leaves of Aegle marmelos were measured using method of National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS). Results: Aegle marmelos leaf extracts and fractions were found to have fungicidal activity against various clinical isolates of dermatophytic fungi. The MIC and MFC was found to be high in water and ethyl alcohol extracts and methanol fractions (200μg/mL) against dermatophytic fungi studied. Conclusions: Aegle marmelos leaf extracts significantly inhibites the growth of all dermatophytic fungi studied. If this activity is confirmed by in vivo studies and if the compound is isolated and identified, it could be a remedy for dermatophytosis. © 2011 Asian Pacific Tropical Biomedical Magazine.},

abstract={Self-setting hydroxyapatite-biodegradable injectable composites are excellent candidates for applications in orthopaedics. We have previously demonstrated the feasibility of development of self-setting calcium-deficient nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite-polymer composites using different calcium phosphate precursors and biodegradable polyphosphazenes. This study aimed to evaluate these novel injectable composites as suitable materials for orthopaedic applications through evaluating their biomechanical properties, osteoblast cellular attachment and gene expression over time. Our studies demonstrated that the morphology of the composite groups (PNEA-CDHA, PNEA-CDSHA, PNEA 50mPh50-CDHA, PNEA50mPh50-CDSHA, PNEA50PhPh50-CDHA, and PNEA50PhPh 50-CDSHA) formed was similar and found to have micro- and nanoporous structures resembling trabecular bone. The osteoblast phenotypic marker of bone, alkaline phosphatase, was expressed by the cells on the surface of the composites throughout the study and was comparable to tissue-culture polystyrene (control). Furthermore, the cells seeded on the composites expressed the characteristic osteoblastic genes, such as type-I collagen, alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, osteopontin and bone sialoprotein, indicating osteoblast differentiation, maturation and mineralization. Within our injectable composite groups, significant gene expression levels were displayed (P &lt; 0.05). These novel injectable biodegradable polyphosphazenes-calcium-deficient hydroxyapatites materials are promising candidates for orthopaedic applications. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2011.},

abstract={In the present work dye sorption of methylene blue (MB) onto two different bakers' yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) samples, untreated autoclaved yeast (UTY) and acid treated autoclaved yeast (ATY), was investigated. In order to study the effect of process variables and to optimize the acid treatment conditions central composite design was employed. A quadratic model was used to relate treatment efficiency to the treatment conditions, acid concentration and soaking time. The results were analyzed using statistical tools like F-test, Student's t-test and ANOVA to assess statistical significance of these factors. It was found that optimum acid concentration and soaking time were 2.1 N and 48 h respectively. After optimization equilibrium studies were carried out with both UTY and ATY prepared under optimum conditions. Using Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models the equilibrium data were analyzed and it was confirmed that adsorption of MB onto UTY and ATY are feasible. It was found that MB uptake capacity of ATY was significantly higher than that of UTY (117.4 against 45.7 mg MB/g). FTIR analyses of the samples, before and after acid treatment, suggest that increase in MB adsorption was due to hydrolysis of yeast. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

A new heuristic operator is introduced in the domain of RGES to maintain feasibility specifically for the set covering problem to yield best solutions. The performance of this algorithm has been evaluated on a large set of benchmark problems from OR-library. Computational results showed that the randomized gravitational emulation search algorithm - based heuristic is capable of producing high quality solutions. The performance of this heuristic when compared with other existing heuristic algorithms is found to be excellent in terms of solution quality.},

abstract={Healthiness of the insulation system of any power apparatus plays vital criteria for its effective performance in power system. Minor flaws in insulation system such as blow-holes, cavities, imperfection on the surface etc are inevitable even during manufacturing stage leading to discharges called Partial Discharge (PD) eventually leading to degradation of dielectric material usually caused by erosion mechanism (tracking and treeing). PD initiated treeing of insulation system has been receiving wide attention by researchers very recently since this mechanism is categorized as a severe case of insulation degradation by electrical utilities. This phenomenon may lead to mal operation of power apparatus. Further exhaustive literature survey carried out in this field has clearly delineated on the close relationship between physics related to the degradation mechanism and nature of flaw (void, cavity etc). Further, since the time between PD initiated treeing and breakdown is much shorter than the time to tree initiation, recognition of such complex and stochastic pattern of PD becomes challenging task even for experts. Standard laboratory models simulating various types of PD initiated treeing is fabricated. An accelerated ageing test method is carried out in testing the laboratory models. PD initiated discharge patterns and treeing patterns are acquired from the direct testing circuits as proposed by IEC 60270:2000. The morphology of the treeing patterns is visually correlated to comprehend the nature of discharge. In addition PD signatures acquired from the PD measurement and acquisition system is trained and tested with neural networks to discriminate tree and PD initiated discharge fingerprints.},

abstract={Polyaromatic hydrocarbons are the most obvious pollutant in both terrestrial and aquatic realm. Its damage in the agricultural fields and normal water system are well documented. PAHs pollution leads to drastic effected on the flora and fauna of the aquatic system and is directly affecting the human life, because of this carcinogenicity and mutagenicity. Biodegration appears to be the best method in controlling PAH pollution effectively. Biosurfactants are produced during hydrocarbon degradation by bacteria and they influence the degradation rate. As a result in the present study, an attempt on the significance role of bacteria in the production of biosurfactant was made. © 2010 Academic Journals Inc.},

abstract={Ubiquitin ligase was an important protease in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Currently, a handful of drugs were available and they are at best only able to offer some relief from symptoms. Cure for this disease is currently not available. Tacrine hybrids show inhibitory activities to the ubiquitin ligase. The three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D QSAR) models and in-silico studies would be useful in developing new drug leads against Alzheimer's disease. The objective of this work involves the designing of new substances, with potential inhibitory activity over AcetylCholinesterase Enzyme (AChE), using rational drug design strategies. © 2010 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={Pre-clinical phase is a laboratory test of a new drug on animal subjects, conducted together evidence justifying a clinical trial. For those drugs which are in clinical phase, method development requires various pre-clinical bioanalytical support parameters. Bioanalytical support plays a pivotal role in answering a series of questions concerning the toxicity, pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters, safety assessment, formulation optimization.Once method development process was initiated one should know the different techniques of sampling, handling, sample preparation methods that are suitable and problems in it. After sample preparation, suitable analytical techniques have to be selected for method development. The developed method now have to be validated, for this, Initially "Analytical Instrument Qualification" has to be performed which includes four main phases- Design qualification, Installation qualification, Operational qualification, Performance qualification. Method is said to be validated when all considered validation parameters like linearity, specificity, selectivity etc are within the limits. Thus the method is developed and validated for a drug in preclinical phase using analytical technique of suitable sensitivity and selectivity.},

abstract={An approach to detection of phishing hyperlinks using the rule based system formed by genetic algorithm is proposed, which can be utilized as a part of an enterprise solution to anti-phishing. A legitimate webpage owner can use this approach to search the web for suspicious hyperlinks. In this approach, genetic algorithm is used to evolve rules that are used to differentiate phishing link from legitimate link. Evaluating the parameters like evaluation function, crossover and mutation, GA generates a ruleset that matches only the phishing links. This ruleset is stored in a database and a link is reported as a phishing link if it matches any of the rules in the rule based system and thus it keeps safe from fake hackers. Preliminary experiments show that this approach is effective to detect phishing hyperlink with minimal false negatives at a speed adequate for online application. ©2010 IEEE.},

abstract={There are certain aspects in the field of networking that needs to be accomplished, yet it is very difficult to achieve. One such concept is Optimization. Achieving a high degree of reliability will eventually lead us to Optimization. But, achieving high degree of reliability?? This indeed is a very big problem that needs a solution. There have been many solutions before that solves the problem in some cases, yet there is nothing so called a global technique available that can be applied to any networks. The next big problem is guaranteeing Quality of Service (QOS). Our paper basically aims at providing a method or an approach which will give us a solution for both of these problems depicted above. The approach we are going to adopt is something related to effective utilization of the routing algorithms available. When one algorithm gives some efficiency criteria, then what will happen to the efficiency if some algorithms are combined? This basic fascination led us to use 3 known Routing algorithms namely Link state, Floyd war shall and Ant colony. These algorithms are applied in phases or stages to get some effective optimization result. This effective optimization will naturally lead us to a stage where we could easily guarantee QOS too. The state conditions that will possibly decrease the reliability criteria here can be easily overcome than in other cases where a single routing algorithm is used. ©2010 IEEE.},

abstract={An algorithm is designed for the hypergraph (HG) representation of an image, subsequent detection of Salt and Pepper (SP) noise in the image and finally the restoration of the image from this noise. The image is first represented as the set union of hyperedges. As for the hyperedges themselves, these are determined by two Image Neighborhood Hypergraph (INHG) parameters, with the concepts of 8-bit neighborhood and INHG of a graph being central. The images taken up for experimental analyses are subjected to the Contra Harmonic Mean (CHM) filter for SP noise removal. The proposed algorithm exhibits superiority over traditional algorithms and recently proposed ones in terms of visual quality, Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). This superior performance of the CHM Filter is solely due to the HG representation of the test images. © 2009 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

abstract={With recent advances in nutrition sciences, natural products and health-promoting foods have received extensive attention from both health professionals and the common population. The flavonoid rich fraction (FRF) of Dioscorea bulbifera Linn. has a strong free radical scavenging activity. FRF (150 mg/kg) when intervened for a period of 35 days prior to isoproterenol (ISO) challenge to rats maintained the creatine kinase - MB (CK-MB) activity in serum without elevation. Alterations in the antioxidant status in the mitochondria were recognized in the heart tissue of ISO induced rats. ISO induced rats pretreated with FRF (150 mg/kg) ameliorated the lipid peroxidation and thereby enhanced the antioxidant status as evidenced by the increase in the reduced glutathione (GSH) content and the activity of antioxidant enzymes. Moreover, the tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes such isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH), succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), malate dehydrogenase (MDH) and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (α-KGDH), which were found decreased in the ISO induced rats showed an enhanced activity in FRF (150 mg/kg) pretreated rats. The activity of NADH dehydrogenase and cytochrome- C-oxidase, the enzymes which transfer the electron in the electron transport chain (ETC) was also increased significantly (p<0.05) in FRF (150 mg/kg) pretreated rats, when compared with ISO induced rats. These results suggest the cardioprotective effect of FRF of Dioscorea bulbifera Linn. in ISO induced MI by attenuating the lipid peroxidation by scavenging free radicals and modulating the energy producing mitochondrial enzymes. © 2010 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.},

abstract={Natural antioxidants fight against free radicals and keep the oxidative stress state in balance, thus preventing degenerative diseases and aging symptoms. The aim of the current study is to evaluate antioxidant activity of ethanol, ethyl acetate, and aqueous extracts from bark of Aegle marmelos. Aegle marmelos is commonly known as beal in India. It is a spiny tree belongs to the family of Rutaceae. The leaves, bark, roots, seeds, and fruits of Aegle marmelos are edible. The medicinal properties of this plant have been described in Ayurveda. The bark was collected, shade dried and coarsely powdered. The powder was successively extracted with ethanol, ethyl acetate and water using cold percolation method. The extracts were concentrated by distilling the solvent and air dried. The phytochemical screening of the crude bark extracts proved the presence of alkaloids, flavonoids, tannins, glycosides, phenols, sterols and terpenoids.

abstract={Despite being age-old and well documented systems of medicine, Ayurveda and Siddha products offers very little actionable data on toxicological profile. The more stringent toxicological requirements of these products as required by prominent regulatory agencies are still unmet. This review documents the toxicological testing of ayurvedic drugs by the globally concurred upon Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) protocols for the whole gamut of toxicity studies, and how to adapt these protocols for the requirements of the ayurvedic researcher. This review discusses on viable means to design, conduct and document studies of ayurvedic products for all possible toxicological manifestations in GLP conditions that can withstand global scrutiny and audit. This review explains how to plan the protocol, choose the test systems, chalking out the observation routine, and conduct, acute, sub-acute, sub-chronic, and chronic toxicity studies, with an additional emphasis on carcinogenicity, neurotoxicity, genotoxicity and developmental & reproductive toxicity studies. Determining scientifically consistent toxicological profile of ayurvedic drugs complying with current regulatory practices can be a fillip to their prospects of wide spread acceptance. This article aims at enlightening the researcher on the basics of designing toxicological studies that can cater to cGXP requirements.},

Given an undirected graph G = (V, E) and weighting function defined on the vertex set, the minimum weighted vertex cover problem is to find a vertex set S ⊆ V whose total weight is minimum subject to every edge of G has at least one end point in S. In this paper an effective algorithm, called Support Ratio Algorithm (SRA), is designed to find the minimum weighted vertex cover of a graph. Computational experiments are designed and conducted to study the performance of our proposed algorithm. Extensive simulation results show that the SRA can yield better solutions than other existing algorithms found in the literature for solving the minimum vertex cover problem.},

abstract={Urolithiasis, the process of formation of stones in the kidneys and urinary tract, is the major clinical manifestation of hyperoxaluria. Ethylene glycol feeding resulted in hyperoxaluria with increased renal excretion of oxalate, sodium, calcium and phosphate and a decrease in the excretion of magnesium. Supplementation with an aqueous and alcoholic extract of the leaves of Salvadora persica significantly reduced elevated urinary oxalate levels, indicating a regenerative action on endogenous oxalate synthesis. The deposition of stone-forming constituents in the kidneys of calculogenic rats was also significantly lowered by curative and preventive treatments with the aqueous and alcoholic extracts of Salvadora persica. The high serum creatinine level observed in ethylene glycol-treated rats was also reduced following treatment with the extracts. Histopathological findings showed signs of improvement after treatment with the extracts. These observations led to the conclusion that the aqueous and alcoholic extracts of the leaves of Salvadora persica are endowed with antiurolithiatic properties. © 2010 Prous Science, S.A.U. or its licensors.},

abstract={Autophagy is a biological process involved in the intracellular destruction of endogenous proteins and has been suggested to be essential for cell homeostasis as well as for cell remodelling. Autophagy selectively eradicates damaged cytoplasmic components like injured mitochondria, which increases mutation rates and promote tumour initiation and progression. In addition, autophagy inhibits necrosis, which promotes progression by inducing angiogenesis and metastasis. This study aims to find autophagy-related cysteine endopeptidase A (APG4A) which has a significant role in suppressing various cancers. This bioinformatics research with a suitable target for inducing autophagy through APG4A would be a real breakthrough in cancer therapy. Copyright © 2010 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={Objective: To formulate Pothos scandens Linn (P. scandens) leaf extract in to a gel and investigate their burn wound healing activity. Methods: Ethanolic extract of dried leaves of P. scandens were subjected to priliminery phytochemical evaluation and wound healing activities studies. Different gel formulations of ethanolic extract of P. scandens (4% w/v) were prepared using polymers carbopol 934 and carbopol 940 by varying their concentration. These formulations were evaluated for physical parameters, drug content, pH, viscosity, extrudability, spreadability, primary skin irritation, pharmacological activity and stability. Results: Wound healing studies of ethanolic extract revealed that P. scandens treated animals were found to epithelise in 22 days while the solvent control and the untreated rats epithelise within 35 and 40 days respectively. The formulation with 1.5% w/w carbopol 934 was found to be more promising as it shows better physicochemical characteristics, higher pharmacological activity and stability compared to other formulations. Conclusions: P. scandens alcoholic extract shows significant improvement in burn wound contraction and hence this is a promising candidate in burn wound healing. © 2010 Hainan Medical College.},

abstract={During tissue morphogenesis and homeostasis, cells experience various signals in their environments, including gradients of physical and chemical cues. Spatial and temporal gradients regulate various cell behaviours such as proliferation, migration, and differentiation during development, inflammation, wound healing, and cancer. One of the goals of functional tissue engineering is to create microenvironments that mimic the cellular and tissue complexity found in vivo by incorporating physical, chemical, temporal, and spatial gradients within engineered three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds. Hydrogels are ideal materials for 3D tissue scaffolds that mimic the extracellular matrix (ECM). Various techniques from material science, microscale engineering, and microfluidics are used to synthesise biomimetic hydrogels with encapsulated cells and tailored microenvironments. In particular, a host of methods exist to incorporate micrometer to centimetre scale chemical and physical gradients within hydrogels to mimic the cellular cues found in vivo. In this review, we draw on specific biological examples to motivate hydrogel gradients as tools for studying cell-material interactions. We provide a brief overview of techniques to generate gradient hydrogels and showcase their use to study particular cell behaviours in two-dimensional (2D) and 3D environments. We conclude by summarizing the current and future trends in gradient hydrogels and cell-material interactions in context with the long-term goals of tissue engineering. © 2010 Canadian Society for Chemical Engineering.},

abstract={Hydroalcoholic extract of Dioscorea bulbifera (DB), a yam variety called air potato, was tested for its protective effect on myocardial ischemic/reperfusion (I/R) injury in rats due to apoptosis and necrosis. Myocardial I/R injury was induced by 30 min ischemia followed by 2 h reperfusion by perfusing isolated rat hearts with Krebs Henseilet bicarbonate (KHB) buffer in a Langendorff set up. Pretreatment of DB (150 mg kg −1 body weight) for 30 days significantly reduced myocardial infarct size and improved the ventricular function (aortic flow and coronary flow, LVDP, LVmax dp/dt). Role of DB on apoptosis was also evaluated by determining caspase 3 as well as by examining pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bcl2 by Western blot analysis followed by TUNEL assay. DB also prevented I/R-mediated down regulation of survival protein Akt and HO-1.

abstract={The present study investigate the protective effect of aqueous root extract of Desmodium gangeticum in preserving mitochondrial and sarcoplasmic ATPase during ischemia reperfusion injury. The isolated rat hearts in both drug and control group were subjected to warm ischemia (37), followed by reperfusion with the Langendorff perfusion system. The aqueous root extract of Desmodium gangeticum (L) at a dose of 50 mg/kg body weight was found to be effective in the rat heart for the management of ischemic reperfusion injury. Physiological parameters were significantly (P<0.05) improved in drug treated rat hearts. Creatine phosphokinase in coronary perfusate found to be declined. Moreover, sarcoplasmic ATPase and mitochondrial enzymes were significantly (P<0.05) improved in drug treated rat hearts. In fact, histological analysis of the myocardium also suggested an improved ultra structure in Desmodium gangeticum treated rat heart. These results suggest that Desmodium gangeticum aqueous root extract can preserve the mitochondrial and sarcoplasmic ATPase in the myocardium, resulting in the improvement of cardiac function after ischemia reperfusion injury.},

abstract={Dedicated service gateways provide Network services which direct traffic flows. Currently many researchers focus on gateway selection on the Shortest Route, Closest Gateway and not much on the congestion and network traffic in this route. In this paper, we have proposed a novel approach called Optimal Closest Gateway Mechanism with load balancing technique for traffic engineering. Instead of only concentrating on the shortest route with high network traffic and closest gateway with congestion, this work selects the gateway that is closest to the source of flow eliminating the gateway which has the highest network traffic. This method is followed till the destination node is reached. This work evaluates the performance of the proposed technique with various Selection algorithms and their results are compared. From the comparison, it is noted that the proposed optimal closest gateway outperforms the existing selection algorithms. Simulation results show that the proposed approach effectively identifies the set of gateways at optimal locations for routing, which in turn reduce the network congestion and hence packet drop rate. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading chronic bacterial infection. Despite potentially curative pharmacotherapies being available for over 50 years, the length of the treatment and the pill burden can hamper patient lifestyle. Low compliance and adherence to administration schedules remain the main reasons for therapeutic failure and contribute to the development of multidrug-resistant strains. The design of novel antibiotics attempts to overcome drug resistance, to shorten the treatment course, and to reduce drug interactions. In this framework, nanotechnology appears as one of the promising approaches for the development of more effective medicines. The present review thoroughly overviews the development of novel microparticulate, encapsulation, and various other carrier-based drug delivery systems for incorporating the principal anti-TB agents. Drug delivery systems have been designed that either target the site of TB or reduce the dosing frequency with the aim of improving patient healthcare.},

abstract={In the present work kinetics of methylene blue adsorption onto three low-cost adsorbents namely guava leaf powder (GLP), teak leaf powder (TLP) and gulmohar leaf powder (GUL) was predicted using film-pore diffusion model. The model equations were solved numerically by method of lines using Excel. Initial estimates of mass transfer parameters namely external-film transfer coefficient and internal diffusion coefficient were obtained using single resistance models at temperatures 303, 313 and 323K and for initial dye concentrations 50, 100, 150 and 200mgdm-3. Film-pore diffusion model was then used to determine the concentration-independent values of these mass transfer coefficients. Thus, external-film transfer coefficients were found to be in the range of 3×10-6 to 35×10-6ms-1, 1×10-6 to 8×10-6ms-1 and 1×10-6 to 11×10-6ms-1 for guava, teak and gulmohar leaf powders, respectively, in the chosen temperature range. At the same time internal diffusion coefficients were in the range of 0.1×10-12 to 1.9×10-12m2s-1, 0.1×10-12 to 0.6×10-12m2s-1 and 0.2×10-12 to 1.3×10-12m2s-1 for guava, teak and gulmohar leaf powders, respectively.

abstract={Background &amp; Objectives: The present investigation was aimed to evaluate the beneficial efficiency of a polyherbal ointment in treating excision and bum wounds in albino rats. Methods: Animals were divided into 6 groups of six rats each. Wound was created in all the animals. In Group I, II, III animals, excision wound was caused, using a sharp surgical blade and pointed scissors for an area of 200mm 2 and depth of 0.2 cm in the skin on the dorsal side of the rats. In Group IV, V, VI rats, burn wound was created on the dorsal side of the animals using a steel rod of 2.5cm diameter, which was heated to 80-85°C. Group I &amp; IV served as disease control, Group II &amp; V received topical application of 1g of polyherbal ointment, Group III &amp; VI received topical application of 1g of reference ointment Gentamicin. The treatment was given daily and rats were kept under constant observation. The rate of wound contraction was measured at an interval of 5 days. The wound healing efficacy of the polyherbal ointment was analyzed by isolating granulated tissues and blood sample. The biochemical and enzymatic parameters studied were ascorbic acid, hydroxy proline, hexosamine, Superoxide dismutase and Lipid peroxidase. Results: The excision and burn wounds, treated with the polyherbal ointment showed a higher rate of contraction and epithelialization during the treatment period. Hydroxy proline, hexosamine, ascorbic acid levels and superoxide dismutase activity were increased in the rats treated with polyherbal ointment. Lipid peroxide level was decreased when compared to control and standard group. Interpretation &amp; Conclusion: In the present work, wound healing efficacy of polyherbal ointment is validated by evaluationg the biochemical profiles of drug treated and untreated groups. It revealed a significant increase in hydroxy proline, hexosamine and vitamin C. Alteration in lipid peroxide and superoxide dismutase were also resumed to normal on treatment with formulated ointment. From the results obtained the present investigation indicates the wound healing efficacy of polyherbal ointment.},

abstract={Bioavailability can be increased by changing in disintegration and dissolution the aqueous solubility is lesser than 1μg /ml will defiantly create a bioavailability problem and thereby affecting the efficacy of the drug. There are number of methods through which aqueous solubility of the drug can be increased in which solid dispersions is one of the effective and accepted technique in the pharmaceutical industry. The purpose of the study was to improve the physicochemical properties of celecoxib a poorly water soluble drug by forming dispersion with mannitol as water soluble carrier. The solid dispersion of celecoxib by physical triturating, solvent evaporation and fusion method were prepared using 1:1, 1:3 and 1:5 ratios of drug and polymer (mannitol). The prepared dispersions showed marked increase in the saturation solubility and dissolution rate of celecoxib than that of pure drug. The dispersions with mannitol (1:5) by fusion method showed faster dissolution rate (82.46%) as compared to other solid dispersions with mannitol (1:1 and 1:3) whichever prepared by physical mixture And solvent evaporation method. The FT-IR shows the complexation and there were no interactions. Finally, solid dispersions of celecoxib: mannitol prepared as 1:5 ratio by fusion method showed excellent physicochemical characteristics and was found to be described by dissolution kinetics and was selected as the best formulation in the study.},

abstract={A non-invasive optical method for the characterization of biological tissues using nanoscale FinFET photodetector by wavelet approach has been theoretically developed and presented in this paper. To the best of our knowledge, this approach is the first of its kind for classifying the skin tissue and muscle tissue by determining the surface potential variations of nanoscale FinFET photodetector illuminated by a laser source. The compositional variation of various tissues could be determined by solving the 3-D Poisson-Schrödinger equation using interpolating wavelets. The optical parameters such as absorption and reduced scattering coefficients are also estimated. By this method, the point-to-point variation in tissue composition and structural variation in healthy and diseased tissues could be determined. The results obtained are used to examine the performance of the device for its suitable use as a nanoscale sensor for classification of different tissues.},

abstract={Beaches between the Kallar and Vembar River mouths on the southeast coast of India are rich in placer mineral deposits. Beach sediments were sampled along this 25-km shoreline and were analyzed to determine the density sorting patterns in order to understand the process of beach placer formation. Determinations of individual placer minerals reveal that the density variations reflect the sorting process and were most effective in concentrating ilmenite, garnet and zircon, while the concentrations of quartz were reduced. This pattern of sorting reflects the density and grain size variations of the minerals present in the beach. Density sorting plays a very crucial role in the concentration of placer minerals in this region. The economically viable heavy mineral deposits are governed by the presence of the source rock being in close proximity, the existing drainage pattern, topography, climate, and coastal processes. These factors permit the identification of regions where the formation of placer deposits is favored. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Polyimides were soluble in polar approtic solvents and increases in solubility in common organic solvents were observed due to the presence of flexible groups and methyl groups in the chain backbone. The polyimides exhibited good thermal stability, and the temperature at which 10% weight loss occurred ranged from 378 to 465 °C in nitrogen.

abstract={The present investigation pertains to the study of the mechanical properties and fracture behavior of sinterforged low alloy steels containing copper (Cu) and molybdenum (Mo) as alloying elements. Elemental powders of atomized iron, graphite, molybdenum, and copper weremixed in suitable proportions using a ball mill, compacted in a 1,000 kN hydraulic press using suitable cylindrical die-punch combination and sintered at 1,000 ± 10°C in a muffle furnace for a period of 120min in order to yield the alloy compositions (by weight) such as Fe-0.5% C, Fe-0.5% C-1% Cu, Fe-0.5% C-2% Cu, Fe-0.5% C-1% Mo, and Fe-0.5% C-2% Mo. The sintered cylindrical preforms were then subjected to hot upset forging to near theoretical density and subsequently machined off to standard size in order to carry out the mechanical tests such as hardness, tensile, and impact tests. Addition of Cu and Mo to the plain carbon steel has been observed to enhance the tensile strength as well as hardness of the sinter-forged alloys. The presence of Mo carbides in the microstructure of the alloys further reinforces this observation. The impact strength of this alloy has been observed to be reduced considerably due to the addition of the alloying elements. © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2010.},

Ethylene glycol feeding resulted in hyperoxaluria as well as increased renal excretion of calcium, phosphate and oxalate. Increase in oxidative milieu in hyperoxaluria was also evident by increased lipid peroxidation (LPO) and decreased enzymic and non-enzymic antioxidants. Decrease in the activities of renal enzymes exemplified the damage induced by oxalate, which correlated positively with increased lipid peroxidation and increased oxalate synthesis. These abnormal biochemical aberrations were attenuated with β-amyrin. From the present study, it can be concluded that β-amyrin may serve as candidate for alleviating oxalate toxicity.},

abstract={The antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein is overexpressed in a variety of cancers, particularly leukemias. In some cell types this is the result of enhanced stability of bcl-2 mRNA, which is controlled by elements in its 3′-untranslated region. Nucleolin is one of the proteins that binds to bcl-2 mRNA, thereby increasing its half-life. Here, we examined the site on the bcl-2 3′-untranslated region that is bound by nucleolin as well as the protein binding domains important for bcl-2 mRNA recognition. RNase footprinting and RNA fragment binding assays demonstrated that nucleolin binds to a 40-nucleotide region at the 5′ end of the 136-nucleotide bcl-2 AU-rich element (AREbcl-2). The first two RNA binding domains of nucleolin were sufficient for high affinity binding to AREbcl-2. In RNA decay assays, AREbcl-2 transcripts were protected from exosomal decay by the addition of nucleolin. AUF1 has been shown to recruit the exosome to mRNAs. When MV-4-11 cell extracts were immunodepleted of AUF1, the rate of decay of AREbcl-2 transcripts was reduced, indicating that nucleolin and AUF1 have opposing roles in bcl-2 mRNA turnover. When the function of nucleolin in MV-4-11 cells was impaired by treatment with the nucleolin-targeting aptamer AS1411, association of AUF1 with bcl-2 mRNA was increased. This suggests that the degradation of bcl-2 mRNA induced by AS1411 results from both interference with nucleolin protection of bcl-2 mRNA and recruitment of the exosome by AUF1. Based on our findings, we propose a model that illustrates the opposing roles of nucleolin and AUF1 in regulating bcl-2 mRNA stability. © 2010 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

Results: The corneal epithelial cells morphology and mRNA expression of markers were similar in both the serumdependent and serum-free B27 supplemented culture. The growth and proliferation of the serum-free B27 supplemented culture was significantly higher than that of the serum-dependent culture. The wnt, hedgehog, survival, NFkB, Jak-Stat, and calcium protein kinase C pathways were highly expressed in the serum-free B27 supplemented corneal epithelial culture. Conclusions: Most signaling pathway genes are upfolded by B27 supplementation in the corneal epithelial cell culture; it could be an efficient replacement for serum. © 2010 Molecular Vision.},

abstract={Purpose: Previously we showed that epithelial cell adhesion molecule (Ep-CAM), a cell surface molecule, was highly expressed in primary retinoblastoma tumors. In the present study, we studied the genes regulated by Ep-CAM in a retinoblastoma Y79 cell line in vitro using a combination of short interference RNA and microarray technology. Methods: Flow cytometry, quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (Q-RT-PCR), and immunohistochemistry were performed to confirm the Ep-CAM re-expression in the Y79 cells treated with 5′-azacytidine (AZC). Ep-CAM expression in AZC-treated Y79 cells was silenced using synthetic anti-Ep-CAM short interference RNA, and whole genome microarray was performed to determine the gene expression changes post Ep-CAM knockdown. Ep-CAM inhibition was confirmed by Q-RT-PCR, western blotting, and immunofluorescence. Results: Ep-CAM expression was significantly restored in Y79 cells on day 5 of AZC treatment. Ep-CAM inhibition significantly affected Y79 cell proliferation. We identified 465 upregulated genes (≥1.0 fold) and 205 downregulated genes (≤0.5 fold) in response to knockdown of Ep-CAM. These genes regulate several aspects of tumor function, including cell survival/proliferation, DNA replication/transcription, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. Quantitative pathway analysis using Biointerpreter further revealed that the most pronounced effect of Ep-CAM knockdown was deregulation of pathways that include mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP) kinase and tumor protein 53 (P53) pathways. Real-time Q-RT-PCR confirmed microarray gene expression changes for selected genes. Conclusions: Ep-CAM silencing significantly decreases Y79 cell proliferation and revealed a wide network of deregulated pathways in vitro. Future studies targeting Ep-CAM gene expression in vivo will help to delineate the mechanisms associated with Ep-CAM gene function in neoplastic transformation and define the potential for Ep-CAM-based molecular intervention in retinoblastoma patients. © 2010 Molecular Vision.},

abstract={Quorum sensing (QS) is a process that enables bacteria to communicate using secretd signaling molecules called autoinducer. Pseudomonas aeruginosa an opportunistic pathogen in immune compromised patients is under the regulation of two different acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) as the quorum signal molecules: N-3-oxododecanoyl homoserine lactone (3OC12) and N- butanoyl homoserine lactone (C4). Technology is required to block the very basic mechanism of bacterial communication that appear to control toxin production, adherence, motility, proteolysis and other virulence factors leading to pathogenecity. Natural products especially plants used in traditional medicines in different organisms are a promising source for deriving molecules that can potentially inhibit QS. Our objective was to screen for the QS inhibitory properties of 2 high quality herbs such as Phyllanthus emblica and Quercus infectoria. Effect of these extracts on P. aeruginosa virulence factors such as pyocyanin, total protease, elastase and biofilm formation were quantified by standard protocols. The result indicate that between and among the extracts of these two plants the aqueous extract of P. emblica showed greater reduced activity of pyocyanin synthesis, proteolytic enzymes elastolytic enzymes and biofilm formation.},

abstract={The submerged semicircular breakwater (SBW) is mainly adopted to prevent beach erosion and to reduce the incident wave energy on its leeside, if it is used in front of a vertical breakwater. In addition, it facilitates the premature wave breaking, which in turn causes the reduction in wave energy. The dynamic pressures and forces exerted on the submerged SBW with 7%, 11%, and 17% of the exposed surface area with perforations on its seaside due to regular waves were measured. The hydrodynamic characteristics such as variations in the dimensionless pressures and forces, reflection and transmission coefficients on the semicircular caisson as a function of scattering parameter for three different water depths are presented and an optimum depth of submergence is arrived. The results on the above stated variables for seaside perforated SBWs are compared with the results of an impermeable SBW to study the effect of perforations. Copyright © 2010 by ASME.},

abstract={Objectives: Anti ischemic reperfusion effect of crude methanol extract of Desmodium gangeticum root had been reported earlier but how is modulating its cardiotonic effect to render cardio-protection is largely unknown. Methods: The inotropic effect of methanol extract of Desmodium gangeticum root was investigated on isolated frog heart and further analyzed the physiological and biochemical effects in isolated rat hearts. Global ischemia (30min) and reperfusion (45min) were modeled in-vitro condition by using Langendorff perfusion apparatus. Results: Our results indicate that methanol extract of Desmodium gangeticum root showed a dose dependent negative inotropic and chronotropic effect on isolated frog heart and mimetic acetylcholine like action. In the isolated rat heart model for ischemia reperfusion injury, the results from different biochemical and physiological effect of Desmodium gangeticum root suggested the cardio-protective nature of the herbal extract that acts similar to acetylcholine (G protein agonist). Moreover, GS/MS result of Desmodium gangeticum root shows the presence of 4-[2-(dimeth-ylamino) ethyl] phenol, a G protein agonist and a-asarone, a potent antioxidant. Conclusions: The above results suggest that Desmodium gangeticum root extract mediates the cardio protection in ischemic reperfusion injury model in rat heart through negative inotropic and chronotropic effect by stimulating the G coupled receptors similar to the action of acetylcholine. 2010 © TurkJBiochem.com.},

abstract={Background: The treatment of AIDS remains a serious challenge owing to high genetic variation of Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1). The use of different antiretroviral drugs (ARV) is significantly limited by severe side-effects that further compromise the quality of life of the AIDS patient. In the present study, we have evaluated a liposome system for the delivery of nevirapine, a hydrophobic non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor. Liposomes were prepared from egg phospholipids using thin film hydration. The parameters of the process were optimized to obtain spherical liposomes below 200 nm with a narrow polydispersity. The encapsulation efficiency of the liposomes was optimized at different ratios of egg phospholipid to cholesterol as well as drug to total lipid. The data demonstrate that encapsulation efficiency of 78.14% and 76.25% were obtained at egg phospholipid to cholesterol ratio of 9:1 and drug to lipid ratio of 1:5, respectively. We further observed that the size of the liposomes and the encapsulation efficiency of the drug increased concomitantly with the increasing ratio of drug and lipid and that maximum stability was observed at the physiological pH. Thermal analysis of the drug encapsulated liposomes indicated the formation of a homogenous drug-lipid system. The magnitude of drug release from the liposomes was examined under different experimental conditions including in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum or in the presence of an external stimulus such as low frequency ultrasound. Within the first 20 minutes 40, 60 and 100% of the drug was released when placed in PBS, DMEM or when ultrasound was applied, respectively. We propose that nevirapine-loaded liposomal formulations reported here could improve targeted delivery of the anti-retroviral drugs to select compartments and cells and alleviate systemic toxic side effects as a consequence. © 2010 Ramana et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={This paper presents a heuristic to solve large size 0-1 Multi constrained Knapsack problem (01MKP) which is NP-hard. Many researchers are used heuristic operator to identify the redundant constraints of Linear Programming Problem before applying the regular procedure to solve it. We use the intercept matrix to identify the zero valued variables of 01MKP which is known as redundant variables. In this heuristic, first the dominance property of the intercept matrix of constraints is exploited to reduce the search space to find the optimal or near optimal solutions of 01MKP, second, we improve the solution by using the pseudo-utility ratio based on surrogate constraint of 01MKP. This heuristic is tested for benchmark problems of sizes upto 2500, taken from literature and the results are compared with optimum solutions. Space and computational complexity of solving 01MKP using this approach are also presented. The encouraging results especially for relatively large size test problems indicate that this heuristic can successfully be used for finding good solutions for highly constrained NP-hard problems.},

This center of mass operator when combined with other Genetic Operators forms a competitive algorithm to the existing ones. Computational results show that the proposed algorithm is capable of obtaining high quality solutions for problems of standard randomly generated knapsack instances. Comparative study of CMGA with simple GA in terms of results for unbounded knapsack instances of size up to 200 show the superiority of CMGA. Thus CMGA is an efficient tool of solving UKP and this algorithm is competitive with other Genetic Algorithms also.},

abstract={Tissue engineering scaffolds produced by electro-spinning feature a structural similarity to the natural extracellular matrix. Polymer blending is one of the effective methods to provide new and desirable biocomposites for tissue engineering applications. In this study chitosan was blended with gelatin and the effect of processing parameters of electrospinning and the solution properties of the polymer on the morphology of the fibers obtained were investigated. The morphology of the electrospun chitosan, gelatin and the chitosan-gelatin blend were characterized using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The miscibility of the blend was determined using a SEM, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) Fourier transform Infrared spectrometer (FTIR). Further the tensile properties of the blend nanofibers were studied and compared with chitosan and gelatin fibers. In this study we have been able to electrospin defect-free chitosan, gelatin and chitosan-gelatin blend nanofibers with smooth morphology and diameter ranging from 120 to 200 nm, 100 to 150 nm, and 120-220 nm, respectively by optimizing the process and solution parameters. Chitosan and gelatin formed completely miscible blends as evidenced from DSC and FTIR measurements. The tensile strength of the chitosan-gelatin blend nanofibers (37.91 ± 4.42 MPa) was significantly higher than the gelatin nanofibers (7.23 ± 1.15 MPa) (p < 0.05) and comparable with that of normal human skin. Thus the novel chitosan-gelatin blend nanofiber system has potential application in skin regeneration. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

A special fea- ture of the designed instrument is that the conductivity temperature compensation can be achieved by soft-ware or the user can maintain the sample at desired temperatures by using the temperature controller. An empirical relationship between Chloride concentration and electrical conductivity of soil samples has been developed using Linear Regression Model, which gave a Correlation Coefficient of R = 0.95 (n = 20), Slope = 14.95, and Intercept = -563.9.

The device characteristics are obtained from the self-consistent solution of 3D Poisson-Schrödinger equation using interpolating wavelet method. To our best knowledge this is the first approach for the self-consistent solution to surface potential computations of nanoscale FinFET photodetector using interpolating wavelets. This method provides more accurate results by dynamically adjusting the computational mesh and scales the CPU time linearly with the number of mesh points using polynomial interpolation, hence reducing the numerical cost. A fine mesh can be used in domains where the unknown quantities are varying rapidly and a coarse mesh can be used where the unknowns are varying slowly. The results obtained for dark and illuminated conditions are used to examine the performance of the device for its suitable use as a photodetector.},

This center of mass operator when combined with other Genetic Operators forms a competitive algorithm to the existing ones. Computational results show that the proposed algorithm is capable of obtaining high quality solutions for problems of standard randomly generated knapsack instances. Comparative study of CMGA with simple GA in terms of results for unbounded knapsack instances of size up to 200 show the superiority of CMGA. Thus CMGA is an efficient tool of solving UKP and this algorithm is competitive with other Genetic Algorithms also.},

This study is carried out by assuming the Rayleigh number small and the validity of Darcy's law. Analytical expressions for both phases are obtained for second order mean in both velocity and temperature fields and evolution of different wave patterns are observed in the fluctuating part. It has been observed that, at the vicinity of the origin, the second order mean flow is influenced only by relaxation time of dust particles and not by dust concentration.},

abstract={This paper presents a heuristic to solve large size 0-1 Multi constrained Knapsack problem (01MKP) which is NP-hard. Many researchers are used heuristic operator to identify the redundant constraints of Linear Programming Problem before applying the regular procedure to solve it. We use the intercept matrix to identify the zero valued variables of 01MKP which is known as redundant variables. In this heuristic, first the dominance property of the intercept matrix of constraints is exploited to reduce the search space to find the optimal or near optimal solutions of 01MKP, second, we improve the solution by using the pseudo-utility ratio based on surrogate constraint of 01MKP. This heuristic is tested for benchmark problems of sizes upto 2500, taken from literature and the results are compared with optimum solutions. Space and computational complexity of solving 01MKP using this approach are also presented. The encouraging results especially for relatively large size test problems indicate that this heuristic can successfully be used for finding good solutions for highly constrained NP-hard problems.},

abstract={The aim of the paper is to build a software based radio capable of demodulating Frequency Modulated signals with the ability to receive upto four stations simultaneously. In addition convolution encoding along with Viterbi decoding is also implemented to aid in error correction capability of digital transmission systems. The initial phase is aimed at software based demodulation of multiple channels of Frequency Modulated signals. The second phase is directed towards the Error correction using convolution encoding with Viterbi decoding for streaming data encountered in digital broadcast systems. Software Radio is a way of designing software very close to the antenna. The basic feature of software radio is that software will define the transmitted waveforms, and software will demodulate the received waveforms. This paper is developed with the help of free software based radio toolkit given by a community named GNU radio. Channel coding schemes need to be used extensively in the case of transmission of digital data over the air or through any other medium. These coding schemes also called FEC (Forward Error Correction) are used in cases where the re-transmission of the data is not feasible or possible. The channel coding schemes comes to the rescue in such cases where redundant data are sent over the transmission medium along with the message. In the receiver side, this channel coded signal is decoded to get back the original data even if the channel coded signal undergoes some interference from the noise in the transmission medium. Though the channel coding has a downside of requirement to transmit additional data over the transmission medium, the advantages offered by error detection and correction mechanisms to the receiver outweighs the disadvantage of additional data transfer rate and bandwidth requirements. © 2010 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.},

Possibly due to this complexity, in practice, the operating rules to be derived not only from heuristic approaches such as rules of thumb, rule curve, operator experience and engineering judgments but also through well defined mathematical models. An attempt is made to study the possibility of changing the crop (paddy crop instead of groundnut) and crop starting period for Sathanur irrigation system, India. This system is considered as one of the water-deficit irrigation system where the water is collected in the reservoir during north-east monsoon (Oct-Dec) and crops are cultivated after the rainfall season. Even though the first priority is to supply drinking water to Tiruvanamalai town and nearby villages, the quantity required for drinking water is very meagre when compared to irrigation demands. Genetic algorithm (GA) has been used to find the optimal crop-starting period that can give maximum performance and net benefit from the system. The results of the model study indicate that starting the cultivation of paddy crop between 1st and 10th of October every year provides maximum net benefit than starting the cultivation between 11th and 20th of December as practiced now. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={Introduction: Some of the previous studies reported distant organ injury like liver injury and renal failure after cardiac surgery, whereas in other studies no injury was identified. Magnesium (Mg) deficiency commonly occurs in critical illness and correlates with a higher mortality and worse clinical outcome in the intensive care unit (ICU). Accordingly, this study was designed to assess the effect of magnesium on liver and kidney function abnormalities during CABG procedure in an Indian population. Methods: A clinical trial (n= 52) was conducted to determine the effects of magnesium (16mEq) on distant organs, administered just before the release of aortic cross clamp in patients undergoing coronary bypass operations. We took five blood samples at different times during cardiac surgery and analyzed the levels of ALT, AST, ALP, uric acid, total protein and creatinine. Cardiac marker enzymes like CPK MB, Troponin I and LDH were analyzed. Moreover, the antioxidant enzymes in erythrocytes like catalase, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione reductase activity were determined along with the level of TBARS. Results: Patients undergoing surgical myocardial revascularization revealed a decrease of antioxidant enzyme activities of erythrocytes in patients with and without magnesium administration during ischemic reperfusion. The product of lipid peroxidation (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) in erythrocytes increased but the extent of release was more in patients treated without magnesium. Similarly, a significant improvement in the cardiac marker enzymes was observed in Mg treated patients. The altered biochemical changes in liver and kidney associated with ischemic reperfusion suggested the impact of revascularization injury and improved significantly in Mg treated patients. Conclusion: These results reveal an increase in oxidative stress after CPB in erythrocytes; thereby it can adversely affect distant organs like liver and kidney. The extensive treatment of patients with magnesium influences the cellular response to ischemia and thus induces protection to heart and other organs.},

abstract={The overall objective of this work was to investigate the modifications that occur in Bacillus subtilis lipid membrane during induced oxidative stress caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS), via an electrophysiological approach. Further, based on the results, we have developed and demonstrated a novel strategy to enhance specific enzyme production. Electrical parameters such as phase angle (θ), impedance (Z), capacitance (C) and breakdown voltage of reconstituted bilayer lipid membrane (BLM) composed of lipids extracted from non-stressed, mildly stressed (2.5 mM H2O2) and strongly stressed (2.5 mM H2O2 with 100 μM FeSO4) B. subtilis were compared. Strongly stressed BLM showed lower values of θ (10°), Z (0.4 Mohm), and breakdown voltage (100 mV) in comparison with those observed for non-stressed BLM, i.e., 30°, 0.5 Mohm and 250 mV, respectively. The capacitance of strongly stressed BLM, however, was higher (2.28 nF) compared to that of the non-stressed BLM (0.4 nF). These results suggest that under strongly stressed conditions, the lipids were loosely packed that resulted in a more permeable BLM. The higher permeability seems to result, unexpectedly, from a higher unsaturated fatty acid (UFA) synthesis and membrane incorporation (UFA fraction increased by 227%), and expectedly, from increased lipid peroxidation (increased by nearly 200%) in the BLM. A strategy that is based on increased membrane permeability due to induced ROS, enhanced specific amylase and protease production under oxidative stress by 62% and 137%, respectively. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Understanding the way the ecological and social components interact in a settlement (a village, town, city) is the key to manage effectively the coupled human-natural system and start programs for its sustainability. This paper presents the utility of a fuzzy inference system to codify the interactions among the sustainability components for effective decision making. The method uses local knowledge elicited through a participatory methodology to understand the linkages among the ecological, social, physical and financial components of sustainability in a village. Considering the complexity involved in the interactions among these components, efforts are underway to devise theories, methodologies and approaches to further our understanding. This paper proposes a fuzzy rule based approach to model the interactions of sustainability components in an agro-ecosystem. The approach is explained with the example of a typical agrarian village in southern India. The proposed approach relies on cognitive mapping to elicit understanding of interactions based on local ecological knowledge. The interactions captured in the form of cognitive maps are used to derive the rules, which govern the sustainability states of the components. Fuzzy inference system is used to simulate various scenarios and to study their impact on the sustainability of livelihoods. Cognitive mapping and FIS promise to be an effective combination in building participatory rule based sustainability expert systems and merits further attention. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Cardiotonic effect mediated by Desmodium gangeticum (DG) chloroform root extract was determined in frog and assessed in isolated rat heart. Ischemia reperfusion injury was experimentally induced in rat by using Langendroff apparatus and was perfused with Kreb Hanseleit buffer through aorta. Ischemia-reperfusion injury was induced by 30 min of global ischemia and 45 min of reperfusion in isolated rat hearts. Heart rate, coronary flow and Left Ventricular Pressure (LVP) were recorded and the activity of lactate dehydrogenase in coronary effluent and creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase contents in myocardial tissues were measured. Administration of DG root chloroform extract (20 mg kg-1 b.wt.) before global ischemia caused a significant improvement of cardiac function and a decrease in the release of lactate dehydrogenase in coronary effluent. Kymogram result in isolated frog heart showed that DG root extract possess positive inotropic effect. GSMS and atomic absorption analysis of DG root extract confirm the presence of bio-molecules that can stimulate the release of calcium in heart. From the above observations of present study, we can conclude that DG chloroform root extract can protect the myocardium against the damages induced by ischemia reperfusion in rats and the effect of the extract may be related to calcium releasing property. © 2010 Academic Journals Inc.},

abstract={Objective: To evaluate the effect of insulin administered via oral route with the help of aqueous extract of Desmodium gangeticum (DG) root in rendering cardio protection against ischemia reperfusion injury in diabetic rats. Methods: Diabetes mellitus was induced in rats by the β-cell toxin, streptozotocin (STZ, 60 mg/kg). Isolated rat (IR) heart was used to investigate the effect of insulin mixed DG pretreatment on ischemia reperfusion injury. Mitochondrial respiratory enzymes and microsomal enzymes were used to assess the metabolic recovery of myocardium. Cardiac marker enzymes were used to find the functional recovery, which were compared with that of the STZ treated IR rats. Results: Compared with IR control group, rat treated with insulin mixed DG showed a significant functional and metabolic recovery of myocardium from the insult of ischemia reperfusion. Even though orally administered insulin mixed DG displayed a slow but prolonged hypoglycemic effect, the cardio protection it provided was more significant than when it was given intra peritoneal. Furthermore the above result indicates that insulin mixed DG can overcome the barriers in the gastrointestinal tract and be absorbed. Conclusions: The above results indicate the efficacy of insulin mixed DG in protecting the heart from ischemia reperfusion induced injury in diabetic rats. Furthermore the study gives additional information that herbal extracts can be used to transport insulin across the membrane and found to be a feasible approach for developing the oral delivery of insulin, as well as other peptide drugs. © 2010 Hainan Medical College.},

abstract={Background: This study aims to evaluate the antioxidant potential of the ethyl acetate extract of Desmodium gangeticum root for cardioprotection from ischemia reperfusion-induced oxidative stress.Methods: The in vitro antioxidant potential of the extract was in terms of hydroxyl radical scavenging activity, lipid peroxide scavenging activity, nitric oxide scavenging activity and diphenylpicrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity. The in vivo antioxidant potential of the extract was assessed in an isolated rat heart model.Results: Free radicals were scavenged by the extract in a concentration-dependent manner within the range of the given concentrations in all models. Administration of the ethyl acetate extract of Desmodium gangeticum root (100 mg per kg body weight) before global ischemia caused a significant improvement of cardiac function and a decrease in the release of lactate dehydrogenase in coronary effluent, as well as the level of malondialdehyde in myocardial tissues.Conclusion: The ethyl acetate extract of Desmodium gangeticum root protects the myocardium against ischemia-reperfusion-induced damage in rats. The effects of the extract may be related to the inhibition of lipid peroxidation. © 2010 Kurian et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={This research deals with the highly available sugar industry waste material, press mud as low cost biosorbent for the removal of textile dyestuff from aqueous medium, and the investigation of the probably involved physiochemical mechanisms. Experiments were carried out in batch reactor. The results of equilibrium studies showed that equilibrium state was reached within 48 h of exposure time and maximum biosorption taken place at the biosorbent dosage of 30 mg/ml of solution. Secondly, several biosorption kinetic models were applied to fit the experimental data, namely Lagergren irreversible first-order, Reversible first-order, Pseudo-second-order, Elovich and intraparticle diffusion models. The proposed explanations were deduced from the theoretical assumptions behind the most appropriate model(s), which could satisfactorily describe the present biosorption phenomenon. The interpretation of the related results have shown that, with R2 of about 99%, the pseudo-second order model is the most suitable dynamic theory describing the biosorption of dye onto press mud predicting therefore a chemisorption process. © Indian Society for Education and Environment (iSee).},

abstract={A multiple-unit floating drug delivery system based on gas formation technique was developed, in order to prolong the gastric residence time and to increase the overall bioavailability of the dosage form. The floating bead formulations were prepared by dispersing nevirapine together with calcium carbonate in a mixture of sodium alginate and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose solution and then dripping the dispersion into an acidified solution of calcium chloride. Calcium alginate beads were formed, as the alginate underwent ionotropic gelation by calcium ions, and carbon dioxide developed from the reaction of carbonate salts with acid. The obtained beads were able to float due to CO 2 -gas formation and the gas entrapment by the polymeric membrane. The prepared beads were evaluated for percent drug loading, drug entrapment efficiency, morphology, surface topography, buoyancy, in-vitro release, and release kinetics. The formulations were optimized for different weight ratios of the gas-forming agent and sodium alginate. The beads containing higher amounts of calcium carbonate demonstrated an instantaneous, complete, and excellent floating ability over a period of 24 hours. The increased amount of the gas forming agent did not affect the time to float, but increased the drug release from the floating beads, while increasing the coating level of the gas-entrapped membrane, increased the time to float, and slightly retarded the drug release. Good floating properties and sustained drug release were achieved. Finally, these floating beads seemed to be a promising gastroretentive drug delivery system.},

abstract={Water distribution networks are considered as the most important entity in the urban infrastructure system and need huge investment for construction. The inherent problem associated with cost optimisation in the design of water distribution networks is due to the nonlinear relationship between flow and head loss and availability of the discrete nature of pipe sizes. In the last few decades, many researchers focused on several stochastic methods of optimisation algorithms. The present paper is focused on the Differential Evolution algorithm (henceforth referred to as DE) and utilises a similar concept as the genetic algorithm to achieve a goal of optimisation of the specified objective function. A simulation-optimisation model is developed in which the optimization is done by DE. Four well-known benchmark networks were taken for application of the DE algorithm to optimise pipe size and rehabilitation of the water distribution network. The findings of the present study reveal that DE is a good alternative to the genetic algorithm and other heuristic approaches for optimal sizing of water distribution pipes. © IWA publishing 2010.},

One of the difficulties in using PKMs such as hexapod machine tools is that the stiffness continuously varies with configuration change at every instant. This makes location of work piece and selection of machining parameters difficult and complicated. A methodology is presented in this article to select optimal machining parameters for hexapod machine tools. Particle swarm optimization is used as a tool in the optimization process.

abstract={Sintered low alloy steels containing the alloying elements molybdenum, copper and titanium were synthesised through powder metallurgy route from mixed elemental powders to yield the compositions: Fe-0.5% C, Fe-0.5% C-2% Cu, Fe-0.5% C-2% Mo and Fe-0.5% C-2% Cu-2% Mo-2% Ti. Green cylindrical compacts were made using a 1000 kN hydraulic press using suitable cylindrical die-punch combination. The ceramic coated cylindrical preforms were sintered at 1000 ± 10 °C in a muffle furnace for a period of 120 min. After sintering, the preforms were subjected to different heat treatment processes, namely, heating to 900 °C, soaking for 60 min and quenching in air or oil or cooled inside the furnace. The heat treated preforms were subject to axial upsetting deformations, at various applied loads and their densification behaviours were compared. The influence of various heat treatment processes on deformation and densification of the alloys was studied and correlated with their microstructures. The plain carbon steel preforms were observed to respond well to the three heat treatment cycles by way of exhibiting the highest levels of densification and plastic deformation. However, both alloy addition and heat treatment have led to a reduction in densification and deformation of the alloy steel preforms. Presence of titanium carbide particulates in the microstructure of the Ti-alloyed steel has played a significant role in reducing the densification as well as deformation. The basic ferritic-pearlitic microstructure of Fe-0.5% C steel has essentially promoted the largest deformation levels coupled with higher densification. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Elegant tools for minimum cost tolerance allocation have been developed over several decades but still there is no specified tool to find the total cost with respect to machining cost and asymmetric quality loss functions. Objective of this paper is to find the optimized total cost by considering the machining cost and the asymmetric quality loss of an assembly. The non linear multi variable optimization of total cost problem formulated is solved using genetic algorithm. In this work, Piston and cylinder arrangement example was considered for concurrent allocation of design and machining tolerance, as well as to optimize the total cost.

abstract={This paper presents a numerical investigation of steady natural convection of an electrically conducting fluid due to both heat and solutal transfer, in a square enclosure filled with porous medium, subjected to a uniform magnetic field applied parallel to the adiabatic walls on the plane of the enclosure. The relevant conservation equations are represented in the non-dimensional form, implicitly accounting for the characteristics of porous medium, and using Darcy's model. The flow is characterized by thermal-Rayleigh number (Raτ), buoyancy ratio (ε), Lewis number (Le) and Hartmann number (Ha). The computer code developed for solving the problem considered is validated with the results in the literature for a wide range of thermalRayleigh numbers in the presence and/ or absence of solutal transfer, however, in the absence of external magnetic field. A comprehensive understanding of effects of the four parameters on the flow and heat transfer is delineated for the ranges, 0≤RaT≤103 0≤Br≤2, 0≤Le≤2 and 0≤Ha≤20. Further, correlations for the average Nusselt number (which is indeed, same as the average Sherwood number) are presented for specific cases where Le=1 while the other parameters fall in the ranges 0≤Ra T≤103, 0≤Ha≤20 and 0≤Br≤2. It is found that the effect of the applied magnetic field is significant to the extent that convection is completely suppressed for large values of Ha.},

abstract={The crystal lattice plays an essential role in the charge density wave (CDW) phase transition together with the electron system through electron-phonon interactions. The CDW in the layered compound 1T-TaS2 at low temperatures has a commensurate phase, which causes superlattice points to appear in the Brillouin zone of the undistorted phase. Since the effect of CDWs is to directly modulate the lattice, it is evident that an investigation that looks directly at the phonon frequencies would be most instructive in examining this phenomenon. Hence the Born-von Karman formalism, in which the equilibrium conditions are fulfilled, has been employed for the calculation of phonon frequency distribution curves of 1T-TaS2 both in the normal and in the commensurate charge density wave (CCDW) phases. A folding technique has been adopted for the calculation in the CCDW phase. The phonon distribution and some dominant phonon frequencies for both the phases have been reported. With these results the thermal properties such as specific heat capacity, Debye Waller factor and thermal conductivity have been worked out, and are compared with the available experimental results. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Nutritionally, they are concentrated source of energy (9 cal/ gram); provide essential fatty acids which are the building blocks for the hormones needed to regulate bodily systems; and are a carrier for the oil soluble vitamins A, D, E and K. Kinematic Viscosity of unheated and heated (270°C) rice bran oil is measured 30° to 90°C. In this paper, the antioxidant stability in palm oil and rice bran oil at different times of heating is investigated using the parameters like density, viscosity, adiabatic compressibility and acoustic impedance of the oils at different times of heating. The antioxidant stability is resolute at every time of heating. Hence, it can be recommended that rice bran oil can be used for frying without adverse effect preventing the incidence of malignancy and coronary heart diseases.},

abstract={The use of pneumatic conveying duct as gas-solid heat exchanger is in vogue in the form of preheater and dryer in cement and pharmaceutical industries, among several other industries. Experiments were conducted to study the effect of solids feed rate, particle size and air velocity on thermal conductance of a vertical pneumatic conveying heat exchanger for preheating of dry solids. Sand and gypsum were used as cold medium while air was used as hot medium. Thermal conductance (defined as the ratio of heat transfer rate to driving force) was found to increase with solids feed rate and air velocity. A dimensionless correlation has been proposed for thermal conductance that predicts the present experimental data for air-sand and air-gypsum heat transfer within an error of ±18%. The relevant properties of solids are incorporated in the form of a dimensionless number, Fedorov number (Fe). The proposed correlation may be used to analyze pneumatic conveying heat exchanger of similar geometry. © 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Electromagnetic interference (EMI) is one of the serious problems in most electrical and electronic appliances including fluorescent lamps. The electronic ballast used to regulate the power flow through the lamp is the major cause for EMI. The interference is because of the high frequency switching operation of the ballast. Formerly, some EMI mitigation techniques were in practice, but they were not satisfactory because of the hardware complexity in the circuit design, increased parasitic components and power consumption and so on. The majority of the researchers have their spotlight only on EMI mitigation without considering the other constraints such as cost, effective operation of the equipment etc. In this paper, we propose a technique for EMI mitigation in fluorescent lamps by integrating Frequency Modulation and Evolutionary Programming. By the Frequency Modulation technique, the switching at a single central frequency is extended to a range of frequencies, and so, the power is distributed throughout the range of frequencies leading to EMI mitigation. But in order to meet the operating frequency of the ballast and the operating power of the fluorescent lamps, an optimal modulation index is necessary for Frequency Modulation. The optimal modulation index is determined using Evolutionary Programming. Thereby, the proposed technique mitigates the EMI to a satisfactory level without disturbing the operation of the fluorescent lamp.},

abstract={Many challenges are associated with the oral delivery of insulin, relating to the physical and chemical stability of the hormone, and its absorption and metabolism in the human body. The present study aims to demonstrate the oral delivery of insulin in both normal and steptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats with the help of the aqueous extract of Desmodium gangeticum (DG) root. Human insulin was mixed with the aqueous extract of DG root (0.1 mg/ml) with human insulin (40 IU/ml) in ratio 1:1(v/v), to prepare oral insulin drug. Decreased plasma glucose level and increased plasma insulin in normal and STZ-induced diabetic rat suggested the probable absorption of insulin through GI tract when insulin was administered by mixing with DG extract. Indeed, insulin mixed DG potentially stimulates the release of insulin in STZ-induced diabetic rat rather than in normal animal. In vivo insulin secretaguage action of oral insulin drug was determined by isolated rat heart model and the results showed a significant cardio protection in STZ rat. The finding of this study suggests that insulin mixed with DG extract can be a promising vehicle for oral delivery of insulin. However, further studies are required to explore the exact compound(s) responsible for the protective delivery of insulin orally. Increased plasma insulin level by insulin mixed DG extract administration in STZ-treated diabetic rat indicates not only insulin secretaguage action of the mixture but also a probable altered insulin release mechanism in diabetic condition.},

This algorithm is based on hypergraph model of image, which enables us to distinguish noisy pixels in the image from the noise-free ones. Hence, our algorithm obviates the need for denoising all the pixels, thereby preserving as much image details as possible. The identified noisy pixels are denoised through Root Mean Square (RMS) approximation. The performance of our algorithm, based on peak-signal-to-noise-ratio (PSNR) and mean-absolute-error (MAE), was studied on various benchmark images, and found to be superior to that of other traditional filters and other hypergraph based denoising algorithms. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={The versatility of polymers for tissue regeneration lies in the feasibility to modulate the physical and biological properties by varying the side groups grafted to the polymers. Biodegradable polyphosphazenes are high-molecular- weight polymers with alternating nitrogen and phosphorus atoms in the backbone. This study is the first of its kind to systematically investigate the effect of side group structure on the compressive strength of novel biodegradable polyphosphazene based polymers as potential materials for tissue regeneration. The alanine polyphosphazene based polymers, poly(bis(ethyl alanato) phosphazene) (PNEA), poly((50% ethyl alanato) (50% methyl phenoxy) phosphazene) (PNEA 50mPh50), poly((50% ethyl alanato) (50% phenyl phenoxy) phosphazene) (PNEA50PhPh50) were investigated to demonstrate their mechanical properties and osteocompatibility. Results of mechanical testing studies demonstrated that the nature and the ratio of the pendent groups attached to the polymer backbone play a significant role in determining the mechanical properties of the resulting polymer. The compressive strength of PNEA50PhPh50 was significantly higher than poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (85:15 PLAGA) (p&lt;0.05). Additional studies evaluated the cellular response and gene expression of primary rat osteoblast cells on PNEA, PNEA50mPh50 and PNEA50PhPh 50 films as candidates for bone tissue engineering applications. Results of the in vitro osteocompatibility evaluation demonstrated that cells adhere, proliferate, and maintain their phenotype when seeded directly on the surface of PNEA, PNEA50mPh50, and PNEA 50PhPh50. Moreover, cells on the surface of the polymers expressed type I collagen, alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, osteopontin, and bone sialoprotein, which are characteristic genes for osteoblast maturation, differentiation, and mineralization. © 2009 Acta Materialia Inc.
