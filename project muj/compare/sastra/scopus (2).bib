abstract={The use of renewable sources of energy to charge electric vehicle (EV) batteries have drawn tremendous interest at present. The need for charging of EVs at convenient locations such as residential areas and semi commercial locations such as office parking lots and shopping malls have generated great interest in the use of solar energy for charging of the EV batteries where there is space restrictions and the need to reduce the dependency on the grid while charging, which shifts the focus towards DC charging infrastructures. Among some of the feature requirements, high power density and efficiency are important requirements. In this paper, the traditional Z source inverter(ZSI) has been modified and modeled to design a single stage DC charging converter. It uses both solar power generated from the PV array and single phase AC grid power to supply a constant charging power for the EV battery. The component sizing and the modeled topology has been shown and simulated results presented. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={We show that a combinatorial library constructed by random pairwise assembly of low affinity binders can efficiently generate binders with increased affinity. Such a library based on the Sso7d scaffold, from a pool of low affinity binders subjected to random mutagenesis, contained putative high affinity clones for a model target (lysozyme) at higher frequency than a library of monovalent mutants generated by random mutagenesis alone. Increased binding affinity was due to intramolecular avidity generated by linking binders targeting nonoverlapping epitopes; individual binders of KD ∼ 1.3 μM and 250 nM produced a bivalent binder with apparent KD ∼ 2 nM. Furthermore, the bivalent protein retained thermal stability (TM = 84.5 °C) and high recombinant expression yields in E. coli. Finally, when binders comprising the bivalent protein are fused to two of the three fragments of tripartite split-green fluorescent protein (GFP), target-dependent reconstitution of fluorescence occurs, thereby enabling a “mix-and-read” assay for target quantification. © 2016 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Halochromic isoquinoline attached mechanochromic triphenylamine, N-phenyl-N-(4-(quinolin-2-yl)phenyl)benzenamine (PQPBA) and tris(4-(quinolin-2-yl)phenyl)amine (TQPA), smart fluorescent materials exhibit thermo/mechanochromism and tunable solid state fluorescence and their unusual halochromic response in PMMA matrix have been used for fabricating rewritable and self-erasable fluorescent platforms. PQPBA and TQPA showed strong fluorescence in solution (φf = 0.9290 (PQPBA) and 0.9160 (TQPA)) and moderate solid state fluorescence (φf = 20 (PQPBA) and 17% (TQPA). Interestingly, they exhibited a rare temperature (0-100 °C) dependent positive fluorescence enhancement via activating radiative vibrational transition. The deaggregation of PQPBA and TQPA in PMMA polymer matrix lead to the enhancement of fluorescence intensity strongly and fabricated strong blue fluorescent thin films (φf = 58% (PQPBA) and 54% (TQPA). The halochromic isoquinoline has been exploited for demonstrating reversible off-on fluorescence switching by acid (TFA (trifluoroacetic acid)/HCl) and base (NH3) treatment in both solids as well as PMMA thin films. Importantly, rewritable and self-erasable fluorescent platform has been achieved by make use of unusual fluorescence responses of PQPBA/TQPA with TFA/HCl after exposing NH3. Single crystal and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) studies provided the insight on the solid-state fluorescence and external stimuli-induced fluorescence changes. © 2016 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={SQL injection is a code injection technique; it has been a top most security threat to web applications and it mainly targets the databases that are accessible through a web application. Any attacker can embed an injected string into the original query, which poses a serious threat to web application security. Attacker exploits the vulnerability by inserting crafted SQL keywords and values, effectively altering the semantics of dynamic queries, and causing them to return expected results. Besides many tools and research prototypes are available, that tool doesn‘t detect and prevent the injection attacks accurately in a web application. The existing system supports only single web application SQL injection attacks. In this experiment, a novel approach is followed by developing a hybrid model that prevents brute force attack at the initial stage. If exploited, an encrypted query parser tool will block the attacker from grabbing data from the database. This approach can also be ported to other web application development platforms without requiring major modifications. The proposed system can protect attackers attempting to intrude from multiple Internet Protocols interacting with a database server, which is an advantage over existing methods. © 2016, International Journal of Pharmacy and Technology.

abstract={Map Reduce is the heart of Hadoop, which is increasingly adopted as a programming paradigm by data intensive applications for distributed processing of large-scale data using a cluster of machines. Fixed slot-based resource management model used in Hadoop Map Reduce implementation suffers from performance degradation due to its indecorous resource allocation. Dynamic Map Reduce already exists to overcome the drawbacks of the traditional map reduce technique. The proposed paper introduces a technique called Adaptive Core Allocation for map reduce clusters to further optimize and improve slot utilization of existing Dynamic Hadoop Slot Allocation in Dynamic MapReduce. This will also lead to an effective utilization of processor. Experimental analysis shows the feasibility of the proposed algorithm which indicates the amount of time saved in order to process all tasks of an incoming jobs and it is compared with traditional map reduce techniques.

abstract={Background/Objectives: In the current technology trend, the reliability plays a vital role especially in the mission critical applications like aerospace systems, defense communications, secure bank transactions, etc. Methods/Statistical Analysis: The fault-tolerance techniques are needed for those applications since the cost is very high if they fail. In the past literature, the triple-modular redundancy (TMR) configurations are used and became popular to enhance the reliability of the system. This can be achieved using a voter circuit by calculating the majority among the three inputs. Findings: This TMR configuration is implemented using Altera DSP builder as a case study. But if the voter fails, the TMR does not tolerate an error. This study analyze fault-tolerant voter circuit with 3-Modular Redundancy against single event transient (SET) errors. Some of the mostly used point processing algorithms like bitwise logical operation, negative image, and contrast stretching are used in this study; the high-pass filter is also implemented as a part of area processing algorithm to check the reliability with TMR configuration.

abstract={Background/Objectives: Error correcting codes are used to improve the circuit reliability. Error detection and correction techniques are used for reliable delivery of digital data over unreliable communication channels. Errors are introduced in communication channels when information is transmitted from source to receiver. Single error correction codes are generally used in memory and remove single error per word. The codes that can correct single errors and detect all double errors are also known as Single Error Correcting-Double Error Detecting (SEC-DED) codes. Methods/Statistical analysis: In this study, we implement single error correction encoder for efficient fault tolerance using Altera FPGA DE2-115 device. To reduce the complexity of TMR, we suggest an alternate method which considers effects of an error on encoder i.e., we protect the encoder such that soft error corrupts one bit of the encoder output and this error can be corrected by the decoder. This design minimizes the cost with negligible impact on reliability, thus the reliability is achieved with low area overhead as compared with the TMR configuration method. The simulation results are compared with the standard triple modular redundancy (TMR) configuration in terms of logic elements, power dissipation, and delay using Quartus II synthesis software tool. Findings: The performance comparison of original encoder with TMR circuit is done with modified encoder circuit to correct single error. The simulation results are obtained using Quartus II 13.1 synthesis software tool with Altera FPGA device EP4CE115F29C7 (DE2-115) using Very High Speed Integrated Circuits Hardware Description Language (VHDL). The functional verification is first done with Modelsim tool and then the design is implemented on DE2-115. The timing verification is done using Time Quest Timing Analyzer tool with critical path delay results. The Power Play Analyzer tool is used to obtain power dissipation results for a certain input vectors applied through vector waveform file (.vwf).The modified encoder approach occupies only 13 Logic Elements (LEs); the TMR approach has 45 LEs. Similarly the modified (22, 16) SEC encoder obtains lower delay as 9.191 ns at the cost more power. But the overall performance is determined by providing the FOM value for better comparison. A modified (22, 16) SEC encoder obtains higher FOM value as 28.54 which is good as compared with 6.788 by the TMR configuration. The figure-of merit (FOM) is calculated here as the inverse of the product of power, delay, and area (PDA). Since, the product PDA term should be low, the inverse parameter i.e., the FOM should be high for a good design. Application/Improvements: Development of error-correction codes was tightly coupled with the history of deep space missions due to the extreme dilution of signal power over interplanetary distances, and the limited power availability aboard space probes. They are often used to improve the reliability of data storage media. Error correction codes helps designers to improve the reliability of a system using the information redundancy techniques and hence these systems are more suitable in mission-critical applications like aerospace, banking, defense communications, etc. © 2016, International Journal of Pharmacy and Technology.

abstract={In wireless sensor network, the cluster based communication provides more efficiency and high performance of data transfer.

Many algorithms are under progress in selecting a CH, to enhance a CH performance, and to reduce more energy consumption in a network. If a CH fails, the overall cluster nodes get go off, degrading the network performance. In the proposed system, two CHs are polled, thereby it enhance the high rate of data transfer by distributing the work load according to their area coverage. This system, also provides a technique to enhance the dynamic source routing and consistency of balanced cluster heads, which balance the network flow even any CH fails.

abstract={The growth of Internet applications makes the intrusions on the networking system at a high level.

Many intrusion detection system applications have been proposed in the past and the systems are having limitations in terms of detection accuracy. To overcome these limitations, the proposed research works offers a new IDS architecture by incorporating Multilayer Perceptron Based approach (MLP) for reducing the rate of false positive alerts and to increase the detection accuracy. The experiments are conducted using KDD CUP’99 dataset and the observation shows that the proposed approach reduces false positive alarms, detects intrusion sensitively, precisely and accurately.

Methods/Statistical Analysis: The proposed scheme is the combination of confusion and diffusion process. In confusion part, the position of the pixels are shuffled by using the new index position generated by the Arnold cat map. In diffusion phase each pixel in the shuffled image is substituted by another value using the sorted index value of the chaotic sequence generated by the two dimensional (2D) logistic map and the neighbourhood pixels. Security analysis of the proposed scheme has done by using histogram analysis, correlation coefficient and information entropy analysis. Findings: Combination of chaotic maps for image cryptosystem provides better security at less computational time and complexity with huge key space. The analysis part and the statistical result demonstrates that the proposed cipher has sufficient encryption effect to attack against differential and statistical attacks.

abstract={Objectives: Communication between the clients over the internet poses the main challenge i.e., to build a secured network that keeps up with the demand, by simultaneously reducing the energy consumption. This communication can be achieved by installing certain add-ons in the client and server sides. Methods: In the existing methods, the communication between the end clients using CoAP protocol is a difficult task. In the proposed architecture, the main task is to achieve the communication between the end clients without gateways or intermediate proxies. In this method, the ports used for the HTTP (8000) and CoAP (5683) protocols are to be opened simultaneously for achieving communication. With the help of this protocol, the end clients can be connected over the internet. Findings: CoAP uses Universal Datagram Packets (UDP) since it uses its own DTLS security for the embedded devices. The system makes use of the Web IOPi and the txThings, a framework to communicate with the CoAP. Applications: In this work, txThings and WebIOPi are used in the Raspberry Pi and add-ons are installed along with the txThings and WebIOPi in the Web Browser using the command line interface. Since the Raspberry Pi used which is embedded device, the energy is saved. The implemented system can be used in diverse real time applications. The implementation is done in the frontend so that it can be controlled over the internet with the help of the CoAP protocol.},

Method/Statistical analysis: Electronic [E]-Healthcare system is a web application which creates awareness about fatal and non-fatal diseases by the parameters provided by the end-user. The system predicts a disease and its corresponding prevention mechanism based on a group of symptoms given by the end-user. The proposed system takes into account the vital factors such as age, blood pressure and sugar level for indicating a particular disease and its corresponding prevention mechanism. This novel approach of classification is manipulated through Naïve Bayes algorithm. Findings: The disease is predicted through its occurrence and count. After which the manipulation is carried off to drag the final probability, the disease with highest (max. value) probability is the resultant (predicted) disease.

abstract={Objectives: With the recent developments in finding the three-dimensional structure of the scene from high speedy vehicles tracking, Optical flow field plays a significant role. Optical flow is utilized to ascertain the direction and speed of the motion of the objects from a video. The large displacement optical flow incurred by the various methods is unsuitable for practical applications due to the presence of noise. So we propose a new method for denoising the flow field by post applying different versions of Tetrolet Transform over the results obtained from two famed large displacement optical flow methods. Methods/Statistical Analysis: Tetrolet Transform, a Haar based wavelet transform which decomposes the noises but preserves the edges that contains useful information. The multi resolution analysis can be done using Tetrolet Transform. The simulation of the Tetrolet Transform in terms of the metrics Peak Signal to Noise Ratio(PSNR) and Computation time was simulated in Matlab environment. Findings: From the simulation results, the Tetrolet 16 rel edge, a version of modified Tetrolet surpass in excellence for the two flows which preserves the edges, so for denoising, the same can be used. The Tetrolet transform for denoising the large displacement optical flow is well suited for SIFT flow than Brox flow using many parameters. Application/Improvements: This can be used in many applications like high speed tracking, stereo disparity, 3D reconstruction and diagnosing medical images. © 2016, International Journal of Pharmacy and Technology.

abstract={Objectives: With the development in technology, and the heavy dependence on it for pursuing day-to-day activities, this has arisen the need for the microelectronic technology used to be made redundant wherever necessary so that the regular activities are not affected. Methods/Statistical analysis: Triple-modular redundancy (TMR) uses a voting scheme where there are three modules of the original system and even if one of the modules fails, the other two can maintain the integrity of the system and produce a fault-free output. ECAD tools like Microwind2.6a and DSCH2.6c is used. Findings: With the various voter circuits using different gates and CMOS transistors, a SET tolerant voter circuit is obtained with different values of figure of merit, depending on the context where the voter is used, one among the different voters could be used for fault-tolerance. Application/Improvements: SET tolerant systems can be particularly useful where, relatively little circuit redundancy can be afforded to achieve a better reliability like space, avionic, military and banking systems. © 2016, International Journal of Pharmacy and Technology.

abstract={Objectives: A reliable and effective data communication is required without imposing overheads in terms of energy, communication costs, processing and the network latency. Data aggregation is the process which provides capabilities like In-Network processing, reducing the communication overhead, eliminating redundant packet transmissions and increases the lifetime of the network. Methods: A method for implementing secure data aggregation using Lightweight Cryptographic primitives is proposed which is suitable for resource constrained networks. Security services provided include authentication, integrity and confidentiality. A Lightweight Cryptography algorithm SPECK is used for encryption and decryption of the aggregated data. Instead of using the same key repeatedly an unique key is generated for every session. Findings: By implementing security primitives it is possible to provide basic services that are required to make the established network immune to attacks. The proposed method is analysed in terms of execution time, memory usage and throughput and provides better results in comparison to existing standard encryption algorithms. Application/Improvement: It is very well suited for application in which the data needs to be processed periodically and continuously. The future scope of work includes analyzing the scalability and communication overhead for large network of nodes and Homomorphic evaluation of the algorithm to deliver end-to-end security services.},

abstract={Workflow applications have increased in large scale in science and technology. With this increase, relentless efforts have been put for the improvement of the performance of the workflow applications to exploit these abundant resource usage in IaaS clouds and with less attention to the deadline constraint. The resource usage became less efficient as the provisioned resources have increased greatly and the excessive provision of these resources resulted in the wastage of unused resources. Our proposed system improvises the existing system by considering deadline and resource constraints simultaneously. It allocates proper instance types to the tasks based on its profile type and satisfies user’s budget and deadline. There are many scheduling algorithms which aims at the completion of work within the QoS parameters. However many such algorithms are not efficient to satisfy even the basic principles of cloud computing like heterogeneity and scalability. Therefore our work focuses on examining and studying several problems of workflow scheduling. We will mainly focus on basic structures of workflow applications in IaaS. © 2016, International Journal of Pharmacy and Technology. All rights reserved.},

Steganography deals with concealing secret message in the image whereas cryptography is about altering the message into a distorted form, so that it is prevented from unauthorized access. Combining both the steganographic and cryptographic techniques will yield a secure and sophisticated system for exchanging the secret information between the sender and receiver. QR codes, also known as two-dimensional barcodes are used for increased encoding space. In this paper, a secure information model is built by combining cryptography and steganography. QR codes are employed for encoding the encrypted message. A nested image steganography is performed with QR codes on a suitable cover image.

abstract={Objectives: In the current microelectronics trend, reliability is a major concern due to very large scale integration of transistors in a circuit. The hardware redundancy techniques are more popular to improve the reliability and hence the fault-tolerant systems are designed. Methods/Statistical analysis: This study focuses main on the redundancy which is the key to design fault-tolerant systems. The fault-tolerance is achieved here by means of masking faults with voter circuits. The majority among the inputs is determined using voter circuit. In 7MR configuration, the voter circuit determines the majority among the seven inputs; this can tolerate only three errors in a system. Findings: Three 7MR configurations are proposed based on 7MR using 5MR, 7MR using 3MR with additional logic, and 7MR using full adder; the results are compared with the existing 7MR architecture with industry standard benchmark circuits. The functional verification is done using DSCH and Micro wind electronic computer aided design (ECAD) software tools with power, delay, and layout area simulation results. The proposed architectures are tested with few industry standard benchmark circuits on Alter a FPGA device (EP4CE115F29C7) using Quartus II 13.1 synthesis software tool. The comparative results are obtained by a performance metric called figure-of-merit (FOM) using resource utilization, power, and critical path delay. Application/Improvements: 7MR tolerant systems can be particularly useful in applications like aerospace, where the system can be malfunctioned due to the high energy cosmic particles strike. © 2016, International Journal of Pharmacy and Technology.

abstract={Objectives: Wireless Multimedia Sensor Network (WMSN) is a fast emerging technology, which can deal with audio, image and video along with scalar data. WMSN is widely used for many applications like wildlife monitoring, medical imaging and surveillance. The survey is to investigate the several image compression methods that are intended for WMSN. Methods: Compression techniques are used to minimize the volume of data transmitted, which in turn reduces the sum of communication power and processing power. Any operation performed on multimedia data should be lightweight and so traditional image compression techniques are not suitable. This mandates the growth of new techniques or modification of existing methods to make them suitable for WMSN. Findings: Suitability of the methods is analyzed by the metrics like compression efficiency, processing speed, memory requirement, power consumption, computational load and system complexity. It is found that SPIHT is the most suitable with limitations of moderate memory usage. Distributed Source Coding and Compressive sensing are in the developmental stage and will influence the future vision of image compression in WMSN. Applications: Every method has its own merits and demerits. The one to be chosen is entirely dependent on the application or user needs, the hardware/software platforms used for implementation and the cost constraints. The most desirable algorithm can be chosen and enhancements can be done as per the demands.},

abstract={Objectives: To improve the dependency of the hardware components in critical applications such as military communication, banking system and especially in aerospace communication systems using Hardware Redundancy. Hardware Redundancy is basically achieved by using majority voter circuit to stimulate the final response from the given pool of input responses and to generate the response with higher frequency as the output. Methods/Statistical analysis: This study focuses mainly on N- Modular Redundancy (NMR) modeling to tolerate variations in the responses and further to efficiently improve the structure with improved performance metrics such as critical delay, surface area and the power dissipation of 9- Modular Redundancy Model (9MR). This study also includes a comparative study of the existing structure of the NMR with the modified structure developed of the same and obtain the simulation results of delay, area, and power for better comparison using a Micro wind layout editor tool. The proposed 9MR system is also implemented on Altera FPGA device (EP4CE115F29C7) using Quart us II 13.1 synthesis software tool. The figure-of-merit (FOM) performance metric is calculated and the results are compared by referring the compilation report produced by the tool. Findings: Upon analysis of the two structures of 9MR used in the study, the newly developed structure is found to have gained efficiency in terms of area, power and critical delay with respect to the various test bench circuits used for analysis. The reduction in the number of logic elements in each of the structure effectively resulted in either in reduction in area, critical delay or power dissipation. Thus the new structure has a better figure of merit and hence enhanced performance. Application/Improvements: The developed is worthy of usage in anytime critical applications such as military communication, satellite communication and complex network management. Further developments are possible with respect to the structure to enhance the efficiency and also in the development of higher modular redundancy structures such as 11MR, 13MR, etc. © 2016, International Journal of Pharmacy and Technology.

It occurs when the incoming rate of the packets to the sensor exceeds its outgoing rate which leads to queuing delay and packet loss. Since the energy consumed is proportional to the amount of data being transmitted, energy consumption can be reduced by minimizing the unnecessary transmission of data. Methods: During congestion it leads to exhaustion of energy and decreases the efficiency of the node. In the existing method DAlPaS algorithm is used to increase the network life time by reducing energy depletion at the sensors along a single path by finding alternative path when more than one flow is initiated through the same path. Alternate path selection could be done either by soft stage scheme or by hard stage scheme. In soft stage, the node that receives more than one flow and has the risk of buffer overflow or low power status, advises one of the sending nodes to change the path and it continues to forward the packets for that flow till the sending node finds alternate path and changes the path. But in hard stage, the availability status of this neighbor node is set as false in the sending node's neighbor table, so that the sending node is forced to find an alternate path before it sends the next packet. When more than one path exists, the sender will select the neighbor based on priority. The priority of a node is based on the distance from the sender and residual energy in the node. Findings: In the proposed method priority based dynamic alternative path selection algorithm is used to increase the network lifetime, to avoid network partition and packet loss due to energy depletion and to utilize the node's energy efficiently. Applications: Some of the major applications of Wireless Sensor Networks are security surveillance, environmental data compilation and tracking of sensor node. Sensor network applications are wide in range and they vary significantly in the mode of deployment, modality of sensing or the power supply.},

But, however the existing work does not satisfy the security feature of the communication of data in the network. Methods: Due to lack of security in mobile agents, there are many chances of security breach through intruders. To overcome these disadvantages, a general secured aglets system has been proposed and load balancing is achieved effectively through various models. Findings: The evolved aglet system exhibits high security under the external attackers. Hence, it distributes workload for all intermediate client users and determines various time calculations like Total run-time and Elapsed-time. Applications: Some mobile agent applications are Mobile Computing, Personal Assistant, E-commerce, Data Collection, Secure Brokering, Information Distribution, Network Security testing, Database searches and Parallel Computing.},

abstract={Public key cryptography helps in achieving information security in wireless networks. Public key will be issued by CA (Certificate Authority). But having CA in wireless network makes it vulnerable to various attacks. Hence distributed cache was proposed where each node in network caches public key of some nodes existing in network in its cache and request to obtain keys not cached will be made via trusted nodes. Due to limited memory only few keys can be cached. There exists an optimal threshold value for caching keys so that equal number of both local nodes and remote nodes public keys can be cached. Methods: Random replacement policy was used for updating cache contents, where if a node's local/ remote key cached ratio exceeds optimal ratio then a key will be randomly chosen from the cache and will be removed. Here we propose implementation of bloom filter in cache to cache public key of nodes existing in network. Findings: By using bloom filter of large size, more number of public keys can be cached thereby providing space and time advantage and reduces query cost with increased usage of memory. MAC (Media Access Control) id and PSN (Processor Serial Number) are used for uniquely identifying each node in network and are stored in encrypted format. When mismatch is found in encrypted MAC id and PSN, then that node is determined to be malicious node and its id will be notified to all nodes in network thus excluding the node from making any communication to other nodes in the network. Applications: Used for checking an element's presence in the set thus reducing I/O lookup when large data set is used. Used as an alternative to cache as it uses limited memory more efficiently than cache does.},

abstract={Objectives: This paper proposes a new method to enhance security for data hiding in radiographic images through distortion of original data. Method: The process involves applying a Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) to the original data, which groups and stores similar patterns in data, causing distortion. This distorted data is then further encoded in a safe format before hiding it in the cover image. The decoding process decoding from the safe format and applying Inverse Burrows-Wheeler Transform (IBWT) to retrieve the original data from the stego image. Findings: Thus, a 2-level security scheme is implemented. Cryptanalysis of the hidden data becomes difficult since the original data is distorted, thus enhancing the security of the hidden data. Nevertheless, the stego image obtained from this method is less deviated from the original cover image. This is shown from the satisfactory PSNR (Peak Signal to Noise Ratio) and MSE (Mean Square Error) obtained. Application/Improvements: This proposed method can be used wherever steganography or data hiding has its applications. This method can be used in commercial communication, military communication etc.},

Findings: First, the adaptable user interface is used to modify or remove the unsatisfied travel schedule of the user with the specific schedule. Next, the feedback mechanism provides better accuracy rate for the next schedule of the new user. Applications: The group recommendation is elicited out of the personal recommendation system which uses the scheduling reasoning algorithm to provide the user with the perfect travel plan. The proposed hybrid collaborative filtering technique for group recommendation system resolves the data sparsity problem. Along with this, the K-Means clustering algorithm is used to cluster the users and to group them according to their interest efficiently.},

Findings: The surety of the algorithm is achieved by combining cryptographic algorithm with a secret key. A randomly chosen binary template is used as a secret key which is then integrated with the input in order to generate the hash value using an MD5 hashing algorithm. This hash value is then compared with the stored hash value in order to operate the vehicle. In hashing algorithm, the hidden key is a data in which it is applied as an additional input to a one-way function that hashes a password. The principal use of the private key is to defend against dictionary attack and a rainbow table attack.

We work with three ensemble techniques, Boosting, Bagging and Smoothing which helps in improving the stability and providing greatly personalized predictions as outcome. Due to the nature of ensemble techniques of filtering the outliers from data, these techniques are employed for improving accuracy also. The stability is computed in 2 phases as it is proved to be experimentally efficient. Findings: This paper analyses the stability factor of the outcome and the impacts on varying the data quantity. We also analyze the impact on stability due to the variations made to the data under evaluation.

abstract={Objective: There is a need for a distributed data storage mechanism to reduce the probability of data loss and cope with node failure as well. The increase in amount of data generated in the wireless sensor network necessitates an innetwork data aggregation protocol that creates summaries of data as information is disseminated in the network. Methods: An effervescent aggregation technique has been formulated that makes use of the existing data redundancy in the dissemination-based network and combines it with consistency checks to filter false aggregate information. A greedy approach is formulated to keep the copies of the data in the nearby neighbour who has greater capacity. Findings: Architecture designed for in-network aggregation helps in dealing with a large amount of data by eliminating redundant information and at the same time distributes the aggregate information in the nearby node since dissemination deals with memory shortage and node failure. Applications: The benefits of the system include that the redundant copies are maintained in some other nodes which has higher memory and power this may, in turn, increase the reliability of the data in nodes of sensor networks and the availability is ensured during the communication with sinks.},

Methods: Hierarchical clustering is more efficient while non-determinism is of concern when compared with flat clustering. Hierarchical agglomerative Clustering is used, which results in more informative structure than flat clustering on unstructured data. Single-link clustering is taken into account as it does not pays more attention to outliers and amalgamation criterion is local than complete-link clustering and results in intuitive cluster structure. Dendrogram is used to represent the progressive formation of clusters in HAC. Findings: Flat clustering K-means algorithm is used to combine the clusters generated by Hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC). As the number of samples has been reduced, iterative use of k-means will choose better centroid. Applications: The final list of the recommended stocks is then showcased to the investor on short term basis. The baseline data is downloaded from National Stock Exchange (NSE).},

abstract={Objectives: The objective of making the irrigation system automated is not only to decrease the human intervention but also to irrigate optimal water to the crop without affecting its growth. The aim of this paper is to focus on existing technologies for making the irrigation process autonomous and effective use of wireless sensor networks. Method: Many existing methodologies use threshold based algorithm and fuzzy logic which lead to imprecise output. Findings: For the effective automated irrigation, the factors such as the algorithm for finding reference evapo-transpiration and the sensor node capabilities in terms of processing and communication unit and possible exceptions during the irrigation process all have to be considered to have a precise agriculture. Applications: Agriculture is an important area where sensors are deployed for providing abundant benefits like determining the water requirement of the crop, fertility of the soil, index of the leaf area, temperature of the leaf, data about local climate, water quality, water overflow, water continuity etc.},

abstract={In India, the frequency of traffic collisions is among the highest in the world. Most of the accidents are due to blind spots which cannot be directly observed by the driver at control. The paper proposes a collision avoidance system due to blind spots and in the case of heavy traffic scenarios. Methods: The proposed system avoids collision in blind spot and in heavy traffic and does not follow the path of preceding vehicle if the space between detector (Our Vehicle) and host vehicle is in proximity. For implementation of the system, Arduino boards and other drivers along with ultrasonic sensor are used and ZigBee is used for data communication between two nodes. Findings: The Blind Spot Detection (BSD) procedure based on wireless detecting technique ZigBee is proposed to monitor the blind spot region for the presence of interferences, automobiles, or other objects with the aid of ultrasonic sensor. For detecting the vehicles in blind spot, Neural Fuzzy Logic is used for the proposed system. The connection models for the developed system is identified and proposed. The paper also discusses about the advantages of ZigBee over other wireless technologies. The Wireless Technology identified is ZigBee which will lower the wiring connection in the vehicles. Applications: This method is useful to avoid collision in blind spot and also lowered the wiring connection in the vehicles by using ZigBee. Hence, the proposed system discovers its application in real time and gives collision free environment. The system is evaluated for different driving scenarios and results are discussed.},

abstract={Objectives: Cloud computing has evolved in recent days and is applied in various fields for effective resources and infrastructure in a distributed environment. Data analysis is the core functionality in cloud computing where large amount of data called Big Data is processed over clusters. Methods: MapReduce is one of the solutions for handling big data in the cloud environment because of its scalability and fault tolerance in a phased manner. Multiple data sets are joined to do complex data analysis for computation on certain aggregates. A common problem is whether MapReduce could be customized to get a scalable system, when the jobs are split and reduced. Also most of the systems do not consider the issue of security in MapReduce phases. Findings: The proposed solution uses multilevel threshold secret sharing to perform MapReduce operations providing secure processing. The solution extends MapReduce framework to improve security and also results in higher efficiency. The mechanism presents lower overhead costs when compared to the existing ones and has essential application in Big Data cloud environment. Applications: These approaches are lower cost and higher efficiency in cloud environment.},

abstract={Objectives: To managing the Virtual Machine and improve the reliability and availability of the resources using Hybrid fault tolerance method. Methods/Statistical Analysis: Basically two main fault tolerant policies namely reactive fault tolerance and proactive fault tolerance. Reactive fault tolerant techniques attempts to reduce the effort required for recovery after a failure, whereas a proactive fault tolerant technique attempts to prevent the occurrence of a fault. The existing method aims to prevent the occurrence of VM failure using a proactive fault tolerant technique which is a static method. But it provides no solution for VM failure, which might occur while the application is still running. The proposed paper ensures reliability of VM by considering both the reactive and proactive techniques in hybrid ways of tolerating the VM failure. In the proposed system, two types of VM failure, insufficient storage and variable capacity change are detected. These failures are tolerated using a self healing mechanism implemented at the host level. Result: The proposed scheme is implemented using Cloudsim simulator, in order to highlight the performance of how VM can be managed. Applications: Virtual Machine failure can be managed and improve the reliability and availability of resources using hybrid fault tolerance scheme.},

abstract={Objective: The autonomous driving allures the attention of people for its technical ability to free up the time behind the wheel and from paying attention to the road. This idea encourages the development of a variety of more sophisticated cars day by day. The driverless car is a vehicle that is accomplished by identifying its environment and steering without a car driver. In short, autonomous vehicles are designed to travel between the destinations by keeping the vehicles on a lane even when the traffic conditions change. Methods: This paper focuses on establishing a technology to develop a unique approach for the integration of autonomous robots into transportation systems. Findings: In this intended method, the autonomous vehicles consist of three subsystems. First, the input unit consists of a camera and ultrasonic sensor to sense their environment and distance measurement. Second, a processing unit is capable of analyzing the sensory data to differentiate objects on the road, which is very useful in planning a path. And the third one is a control unit that interprets the information and makes appropriate decision for keeping the vehicle in a desired path.

abstract={Objective: Monitoring the road traffic is helpful to know about the traffic density of a particular location, which helps in redirecting the traffic when crowded. In this paper, traffic density is monitored and vehicle count is estimated using background subtraction algorithm. Methods: The proposed technique utilizes a novel Motion Detection and Running Gaussian Average (MDRGA) recursive technique. The frame is captured from the input video sequence and is transformed to 0 to 255 gray levels from RGB color mode. This conversion considers the RGB values for each pixel and yield the corresponding reflectance value proportional to the brightness percentage of that pixel. The edge detection is then performed on the gray converted by locating the pixels of the image that correspond to the edges. Findings: The proposed system detects motion by comparing sequential frames crossing an imaginary line marked in the reference frame. Thus, the traffic density is detected and the proposed method is found to be efficient in terms of cost, quality and accuracy. This algorithm fetches the input video quickly from camera or storage device, processes immediately and gives the count of vehicles. This proposed system avoids occlusion problems and gives better results. Applications/ Improvements: This algorithm is helpful to avoid traffic collisions at peak areas, to avoid accidents and to reach the destination on time. Thus, the proposed system finds its application in real time systems and provides risk free environment.},

abstract={Objectives: Different parts of jamun tree (Syzygium cumini L. skeels) which belongs to the family - Myrtaceae are well-known for their antidiabetic activity. Traditional practitioners in India are using the leaf, bark, and fruits of this medicinal plant over many centuries to manage the diabetic patients. Although several research works have been conducted to prove the efficacy of this plant extracts and also to explore the active principles of this plant drug, there is no information regarding the interaction of phytoconstituents of jamun tree with diabetic targets at the molecular level. Hence, this study focused to apply a computational approach to reveal the interaction of molecules of jamun tree with antidiabetic targets. Methods: Lamarckian genetic algorithm methodology was used for docking of 22 phytoconstituents with α-amylase, a key enzyme that involved in carbohydrate metabolism using Autodock software. Results: Analysis of binding energy of ligands with target receptors was remarkably lower especially for friedelin (−9.54 kcal/mol), epifriedelanol (−8.98 kcal/mol), betulinic acid (−8.60 kcal/mol), beta-sitosterol (−8.56 kcal/mol), petunidin-3-gentiobioside (−7.52 kcal/mol), kaempferol (−7.08 kcal/mol), petunidin (−6.21 kcal/mol), quercetin (−6.03 kcal/mol), myricetin (−5.80 kcal/mol), and bergenin (−5.27 kcal/mol) when compared to the synthetic drug acarbose (−2.43 kcal/mol).

The positional accuracy is derived using artificial neural networks, which is been trained with various capacitance values when the impurity is present and gives the details on the change in capacitance value as the impurity position changes. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={The field of telemedicine has gained immense momentum, owing to the need for transmitting patients’ information securely. This paper puts forth a unique method for embedding data in medical images. It is based on edge based embedding and XOR coding. The algorithm proposes a novel key generation technique by utilizing the design of a sudoku puzzle to enhance the security of the transmitted message. The edge blocks of the cover image alone, are utilized to embed the payloads. The least significant bit of the pixel values are changed by XOR coding depending on the data to be embedded and the key generated. Hence the distortion in the stego image is minimized and the information is retrieved accurately. Data is embedded in the RGB planes of the cover image, thus increasing its embedding capacity. Several measures including peak signal noise ratio (PSNR), mean square error (MSE), universal image quality index (UIQI) and correlation coefficient (R) are the image quality measures that have been used to analyze the quality of the stego image. It is evident from the results that the proposed technique outperforms the former methodologies. © 2016, The Author(s).},

abstract={Toxin-antitoxins systems (TAS) are prokaryotic operons containing two small overlapping genes which encode two components referred to as toxin and antitoxin. Involvement of TAS in bacterial programmed cell death (PCD) is highly controversial. MazEF, a typical type II TAS, is particularly implicated in mediating PCD in Escherichia coli. Hence, we compared the metabolic fitness and stress tolerance of E. coli strains (MC4100 and its mazEF-derivative) which were extensively used by proponents of mazEF-mediated PCD. We found that both the strains are deficient in relA gene and that the ΔmazEF strain has lower fitness and stress tolerance compared to wild type MC4100. We could not reproduce mazEF mediated PCD which emphasizes the need for skeptic approach to the PCD hypothesis. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim},

abstract={There is a phenomenal growth in data transfer and sharing. In a client server environment transmitting the data over the communication medium tends to be a challenging task. Existing studies concentrates more on increasing the security of data in storing and retrieving the data. They focus more on improving the cryptographic technique and mutual authentication schemes between the server and client. The importance given to the client’s processing powers and resource availability is comparatively less. In this paper we enhanced a mutual authentication system using Elliptic curve cryptography by employing a hash function before transmitting. The public key cryptography provides good level of security but always gives a variable length of output. Transmission of variable length data is susceptible to computational errors. We provide a fixed length of data for transmission using MD-5 hashing algorithm as it provides optimum amount of security and requires optimal resources. © 2016, International Journal of Pharmacy and Technology.

abstract={During last decade, Semantic web mining grasps the attraction of research and industry people. Besides several semantic web mining solutions offered by several vendors, Industries have started introducing semantic web technologies to increase the values of their external customers and internal employees. The main objective of semantic web mining is to organize the information on the web in order to make it more compatible and understandable. Then it can integrate various concepts of information in an efficient and recyclable way. The semantic web is an added layer of existing layered architecture of web, created as an explicit representation of concepts of information and its associations such as ontologies and taxonomies. More over semantic web technology is merely suitable for free ended environments, but also for closed environments such as industries. Therefore it can be efficiently implemented in various fields with Web services, knowledge management, Electronic Application Interchange and e-commerce.

The promising technology of VANET attracts the researchers towards safety applications. VANET is the subset of Mobile Adhoc Network, created using anonymous vehicles for routing and communication. Hence VANET security got much interest while transmitting life critical information. Malicious vehicle can insert or modify this critical information and mislead the driver to a wrong decision. In this proposed work, a mathematical approach has been implemented to detect the malicious vehicle and the malicious route in the VANET using prime product approach. Simulations are carried out with 50 nodes scattered around 5 square kilometers. The Prime Product Number (PPN) method has been implemented to calculate the trust of vehicle using masking scheme. This method outperforms in detection and removal of the particular malicious node and route. Thereby the throughput wastage of using malicious route can be avoided. © 2016, International Journal of Pharmacy and Technology. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This article presents a power conversion system for novel hybrid renewable power generation scheme with analysis and control of the whole system. In the projected work, a grid-tied power system is employed at first to change the lesser DC input into greater output DC voltage then by converting DC output into AC voltage and linked with grid to run it as a grid-tied system. The production of energy is enriched by adopting multi-input boost power converter, which is coupled with Photovoltaic cell (PV), FC, wind and battery as a storage element. Soft switching procedure is employed for this converter to reduce switching losses. In this Voltage Source Inverter (VSI)using space vector modulation method based on the field programmable logic array is utilized to diminish the lower order harmonics associated in an output of inverter. Management of this output AC voltage with main utility is also accomplished. The results are proved and confirmed in MATLAB/ Simulink software. A hardware implementation of proposed VSI is done to experimentally validate the proposed system effectiveness using Xilinx XCS500E Spartan 3E FPGA board.

abstract={Objectives: Retrieving images from huge volumes of image database has its application in broad areas like medicine, agriculture, military etc. Annotation based approaches have become obsolete because they are time consuming and cannot describe the image effectively. The rich content in the images can overcome the limitations of annotation based techniques. Texture is the most vital visual cue used to analyze images. Methods: In the proposed technique, the image texture features are statistically represented using Generalized Gaussian Distribution in the wavelet domain. A linear score based Support Vector Machine is incorporated to identify analogous patterns to the query image from the database. Findings: The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is ascertained by conducting extensive experiments. Two texture image database of size 1400 and 1920 is used for our experiment. The proposed algorithm is verified in terms of average recall performance against the standard benchmark algorithms. It is observed that the proposed score based SVM yields higher precision and flexibility in separating the similarity within the classes and dissimilarity across different classes. Improvements/Applications: Compared to the traditional approaches, the retrieval rate of this method is improved by 30% at a considerably low computational complexity.},

abstract={The brushless direct current (BLDC) motors have many advantages over brushed DC motors and induction motors, such as better speed versus torque characteristics, good dynamic response, higher efficiency and large speed ranges. Various applications such as consumer electronics, medical electronics employ BLDC motors and hence it is important to develop efficient controllers. This paper presents the development of a virtual motor, a set of programs that represent the BLDC motor, which is modelled and simulated in MATLAB/Simulink. The BLDC motor characteristics are then implemented on the Spartan 3E field programmable gate array (FPGA) using Verilog HDL. Such a virtual motor allows for realizing motors of various ratings by change of the parameters. This is used as a virtual motor for the testing and validation of digital controllers without the risk of damage in extreme conditions of operations, in addition, this can also be used for educational purposes. Experimental verifications using the virtual motor and the BLDC motor using the FPGA controller give similar results, validating the model used. © 2016 Pushpa Publishing House, Allahabad, India.},

abstract={Among the various candidate genes predisposing for cardiovascular diseases, HLA-DRB1* and IL-1β +3953C/T alleles have been implicated repeatedly. To test these in South India, we carried out a case control study of 323 Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) patients, 56 Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD) patients and 254 endemic controls. The polymorphisms were studied by PCR – SSP and ARMS-PCR methods and results analyzed for various clinical and demographic parameters.

abstract={Multidrug resistant (MDR) gram negative bacterial infections are most prevalent in the hospitals which are truly untreatable and remedial verdict are very deprived. In the current investigation, two compounds (Quercetin and Pinitol) and fractions have been isolated and characterized from Indigofera barberi using chromatographic and NMR studies. Antimicrobial assays reveal IB-Me, IB-D and IB-E fractions and quercetin have shown eloquent antimicrobial activity on clinically isolated bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumonia and Citrobacter sp. Molecular docking studies demonstrated quercetin has exhibited highest binding affinity with DNA gyrase B and subsequently eleven pharmacophore features viz. five HBD/HBA, two hydrophobic, one HBA and three aromatic (Pi) rings were identified using MOE. Pharmacophore based virtual screening, docking, binding energies and binding affinity with Born-volume (GB/VI) studies demonstrated thirteen lead molecules which were specifically interacted with Asn46, Asp73, Arg76, Thr163, Lys103, Arg136 residues and conserved water molecules within ATP pocket of DNA gyrase B. These scaffolds comply with Lipinski rule of five, toxicity and drug likeness properties deliberated as drug compounds. Hence, these compounds could be endorsed as persuasive DNA gyrase B inhibitors which can be considered as novel compounds in the clinical management of MDR Gram negative bacterial infections. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Breath analysis has emerged as one of the accurate diagnostic techniques, which can be used to correlate disease conditions with the abnormal concentrations of certain biomarkers present in the exhaled breath. In this background, thin film based chemi-resistive Cerium-doped ZnO sensors were developed for detecting acetone and ethanolamine, which are the notable biomarkers of diabetes mellitus and carcinoma respectively. Ce-doped ZnO thin films were deposited on glass substrates using spray pyrolysis technique. X-ray diffraction patterns confirmed the formation of Ce-doped ZnO thin films with polycrystalline hexagonal wurtzite structure. Scanning electron micrographs and optical absorption spectra of Ce-doped ZnO thin films revealed the decrease in average grain size and increase in band gap respectively with an increase in Ce-dopant concentration. ZnO films with 0.004 and 0.008 M of Ce-dopant concentrations showed a better room temperature sensing response towards acetone and ethanolamine respectively. Highly selective nature of the developed sensing elements towards acetone and ethanolamine with swift response and recovery times can be considered as a non-invasive and cost effective method for the detection of diseases like diabetes mellitus and carcinoma. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.},

abstract={Today most of the systems run general purpose applications which have non-uniform memory accesses. This work proposes a new technique for last level cache (LLC) organization, named as hashed cache using overuse distance for ways sharing (HCOWS), to reorganize the cache memory of a system to contribute better performance in multicore systems. The proposed HCOWS technique can be applied on multicore platforms, to improve performance of cache memory and hence of a system for myriad of general purpose applications. A new mapping technique is employed using universal hashing which is highly random. This scheme employs sharing of ways instead of set sharing. This work evaluates the performance of cache hierarchy using average memory access time. HCOWS scheme-based system has given better miss rate reduction when compared with the simple baseline system by 33 % in dual core, 37 % in quad core and 41 % in octa core, which substantiates the fact that increased number of cores dispenses better performance. The proposed scheme has high impact on miss rate reduction with the increase in size of LLC rather than the associativity of LLC. © 2016, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals.},

abstract={Cancer has remained one of the most indomitable conundrums for scientists over centuries due to its multifarious etiology. While improved therapeutic and diagnostic approaches have commendably augmented the rate of survival of cancer patients, a holistic riddance from the ailment is still implausible. Hence, further explorations to scout for novel strategies of cancer therapy and diagnosis are necessary. Theranostics (amalgamation of therapy and diagnostics) has emerged as one of the avant-garde strategies, which provides a two-pronged advantage in cancer management. This integrative approach has found immense relevance in light of nanotechnology. Nanoparticles can be customized (loaded with a mélange of therapeutic drugs and diagnostic probes) to develop theranostic properties, thereby constructing nanotheranostic agents. These nano-composites are lucrative tools for cancer cell obliteration and simultaneous monitoring of the drug action, and can also be tailored for targeted drug delivery. Nanotheranostic agents have emerged as a prudent ploy for synchronized cancer intervention and detection of the ‘route and reach’ of the drugs. In this review, we discuss the diversified state-of-the-art facets of theranostic nanoparticles, including various nanoparticle-based platforms as well as the plethora of reported therapeutic drugs, aptamers, markers and diagnostic molecules that have found use in the precincts of nanotheranostics. © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS},

abstract={We point out the existence of a transition from partial to global generalized synchronization (GS) in symmetrically coupled structurally different time-delay systems of different orders using the auxiliary system approach and the mutual false nearest neighbor method. The present authors have recently reported that there exists a common GS manifold even in an ensemble of structurally nonidentical scalar time-delay systems with different fractal dimensions and shown that GS occurs simultaneously with phase synchronization (PS). In this paper we confirm that the above result is not confined just to scalar one-dimensional time-delay systems alone but there exists a similar type of transition even in the case of time-delay systems with different orders. We calculate the maximal transverse Lyapunov exponent to evaluate the asymptotic stability of the complete synchronization manifold of each of the main and the corresponding auxiliary systems, which in turn ensures the stability of the GS manifold between the main systems. Further we estimate the correlation coefficient and the correlation of probability of recurrence to establish the relation between GS and PS. We also calculate the mutual false nearest neighbor parameter which doubly confirms the occurrence of the global GS manifold. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Background The rationale of the current study was to test the clinical utility of the folate pathway genetic polymorphisms in predicting the risk for autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and to address the inconsistencies in the association of MTHFR C677T and hyperhomocysteinemia with ASD. Patients and methods An artificial neural network (ANN) model was developed from the data of 138 autistic and 138 nonautistic children using GCPII C1561T, SHMT1 C1420T, MTHFR C677T, MTR A2756G, and MTRR A66G as the predictors of autism risk. A neuro fuzzy model was developed to explore the genetic determinants of homocysteine. Meta-analyses were carried out on 1361 ASD children and 6591 nonautistic children to explore the association of MTHFR C677T and homocysteine with the risk for ASD. Results The ANN model showed 63.8% accuracy in predicting the risk of autism. Hyperhomocysteinemia was observed in autistic children (9.67±4.82 vs. 6.99±3.21 μmol/l). The neuro fuzzy model showed synergistic interactions between MTHFR C677T and MTRR A66G inflating homocysteine levels. The meta-analysis showed MTHFR to be a genetic risk factor for autism in both fixed-effects (odds ratio: 1.47, 95% confidence interval: 1.31-1.65) and random-effects (odds ratio: 1.57, 95% confidence interval: 1.16-2.11) models. The meta-analysis of nine studies showed hyperhomocysteinemia as a significant risk factor for autism in both fixed-effects (P<0.0001) and random-effects (P=0.026) models. Conclusion Genetic polymorphisms of the folate pathway were moderate predictors of autism risk. MTHFR C677T and hyperhomocysteinemia have been identified as risk factors for autism worldwide. Synergistic interactions between MTHFR C677T and MTRR A66G increase homocysteine. © 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.},

abstract={Plant specialized metabolites are being used worldwide as therapeutic agents against several diseases. Since the precursors for specialized metabolites come through primary metabolism, extensive investigations have been carried out to understand the detailed connection between primary and specialized metabolism at various levels. Stress regulates the expression of primary and specialized metabolism genes at the transcriptional level via transcription factors binding to specific cis-elements. The presence of varied cis-element signatures upstream to different stress-responsive genes and their transcription factor binding patterns provide a prospective molecular link among diverse metabolic pathways. The pattern of occurrence of these cis-elements (overrepresentation/common) decipher the mechanism of stress-responsive upregulation of downstream genes, simultaneously forming a molecular bridge between primary and specialized metabolisms. Though many studies have been conducted on the transcriptional regulation of stress-mediated primary or specialized metabolism genes, but not much data is available with regard to cis-element signatures and transcription factors that simultaneously modulate both pathway genes. Hence, our major focus would be to present a comprehensive analysis of the stress-mediated interconnection between primary and specialized metabolism genes via the interaction between different transcription factors and their corresponding cis-elements. In future, this study could be further utilized for the overexpression of the specific transcription factors that upregulate both primary and specialized metabolism, thereby simultaneously improving the yield and therapeutic content of plants. © 2016 Sheshadri, Nishanth and Simon.},

abstract={Persistence is a transient and non-inheritable tolerance to antibiotics by a small fraction of a bacterial population. One of the proposed determinants of bacterial persistence is toxin-antitoxin systems (TASs) which are also implicated in a wide range of stress-related phenomena. Maisonneuve E, Castro-Camargo M, Gerdes K. 2013. Cell 154:1140-1150 reported an interesting link between ppGpp mediated stringent response, TAS, and persistence. It is proposed that accumulation of ppGpp enhances the accumulation of inorganic polyphosphate which modulates Lon protease to degrade antitoxins. The decrease in the concentration of antitoxins supposedly activated the toxin to increase in the number of persisters during antibiotic treatment. In this study, we show that inorganic polyphosphate is not required for transcriptional activation of yefM/yoeB TAS, which is an indirect indication of Lon-dependent degradation of YefM antitoxin. The Δ10 strain, an Escherichia coli MG1655 derivative in which the 10 TAS are deleted, is more sensitive to ciprofloxacin compared to wild type MG1655. Furthermore, we show that the Δ10 strain has relatively lower fitness compared to the wild type and hence, we argue that the persistence related implications based on Δ10 strain are void. We conclude that the transcriptional regulation and endoribonuclease activity of YefM/YoeB TAS is independent of ppGpp and inorganic polyphosphate. Therefore, we urge for thorough inspection and debate on the link between chromosomal endoribonuclease TAS and persistence. © 2016 Ramisetty, Ghosh, Roy Chowdhury and Santhosh.},

abstract={Solubility and bioavailability of drug molecules are the key factors influencing their therapeutic effectiveness in-vivo. The desired drug concentration in systemic circulation can be achieved through the required dissolution of the drug in the biological environment which ultimately affects the pharmacological response. Efavirenz is an anti-HIV molecule with low solubility and variable bioavailability (&lt;45%) and prescribed as first line drug with 800 mg dose. The objective of the study was to develop polymeric nanoparticles of Efavirenz and assess the dissolution enhancement, safety and efficacy using T-lymphatic cell lines infected with HIV-1IIIB strain. The nanoparticle formulations were developed using solvent evaporation method and characterized for its size (110–283 nm), charge (−21 to −33 mV), % entrapment efficiency (57–95%), viscosity of nanosuspension (2.39–4.2 cP) and surface area of the particles (1.4 m2/g). The fourier transform infrared analysis and differential scanning calorimetry analysis of the pure drug and nanoparticles revealed the compatibility and stability of drug in nanoparticles. The in-vitro dissolution studies of the nanoparticles in distilled water media using type-1 USP dissolution apparatus at 100 rpm showed improved drug release based on the polymer composition, as compared with marketed formulations (capsules). The cytotoxicity and therapeutic activity of nanoparticles was studied by MTT assay in C8166 cell lines and syncytium formation assay using HIV-1IIIB strain infected cell lines, respectively. Cell uptake of the nanoparticles was studied by confocal microscopy. The formulated nanoparticles were found to be safe and exhibiting 2-fold increase in therapeutic activity compared to pure drug, which could be attributed to improved dissolution and high cell uptake. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Zinc oxide (ZnO) and Titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles are some of the widely used nanoparticles (NPs) in commercial industry. Thus the chances for the particles to get run off to the aquatic environment and to there by affect the aquatic life are very high. The present study evaluates the short term toxicity of ZnO NPs and TiO2 NPs on Chlorella pyrenoidosa, which is a fresh water algae and on Daphnia sp. which is a common crustacean found in fresh water bodies. NPs were synthesized via chemical co-precipitation technique and characterized using UV-visible spectroscopy, X Ray Diffraction, Scanning Electron Microscope, particle size sizer and zeta sizer. The dosage of the particles was from 0.001 mg/L to 100 mg/L. The study evaluated the chlorophyll content, lipid peroxidation, intracellular protein and extracellular protein as a measure of toxicity against C. pyrenoidsa. The study found that the algae produced excessive amount of extracellular polysaacharides when it gets interacted with the NPs. The light microscopic evaluation also found agglomeration of algal cells when interacted with NPs. The mortality of Daphnia sp. was also studied both in the dark condition and as well as after the irradiation of visible light. The interacted organisms were observed under phase contrast microscope and the images were taken. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={During illumination, the light-sensitive plasma membrane (rhabdomere) of Drosophila photoreceptors undergoes turnover with consequent changes in size and composition. However, the mechanism by which illumination is coupled to rhabdomere turnover remains unclear. We find that photoreceptors contain a light-dependent phospholipase D (PLD) activity. During illumination, loss of PLD resulted in an enhanced reduction in rhabdomere size, accumulation of Rab7 positive, rhodopsin1-containing vesicles (RLVs) in the cell body and reduced rhodopsin protein. These phenotypes were associated with reduced levels of phosphatidic acid, the product of PLD activity and were rescued by reconstitution with catalytically active PLD. In wild-type photoreceptors, during illumination, enhanced PLD activity was sufficient to clear RLVs from the cell body by a process dependent on Arf1-GTP levels and retromer complex function. Thus, during illumination, PLD activity couples endocytosis of RLVs with their recycling to the plasma membrane thus maintaining plasma membrane size and composition. © Thakur et al.},

abstract={The exposure of alumino silicate materials such as fly ash, ground granulated blast furnace slag will undergo thermal activation along with alkaline environment and forms an environment friendly material called geopolymer. These materials not only reduce emission of carbon dioxide gas in the atmosphere but also act as a substitute for cement to meet with the future demand. In the present work a sincere attempt was made to produce ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) based geopolymer concrete (GPC) and to assess its performance by conducting parametric study such as magnitude of temperature, Alkaline liquid (AL) to GGBFS ratio, SiO3 to OH ratio and age of concrete on compressive strength. All the experiments were conducted with a constant sodium hydroxide (NaOH) molarity of 14. Detailed experimental investigations were carried out to assess the effect of the above mentioned parameters under thermal curing with three different curing temperatures of 60, 80 and 100 °C. From the experimental results it was understood that geopolymer concrete with AL/GGBFS = 0.30, SiO3/OH = 1.5 and curing temperature of 80 °C, yielded better compressive strength when compared to all the other combinations used in the present work. Hence use of GGBFS based geopolymer concrete could be feasible for any engineering construction and most preferred for precast construction. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={It is widely recognized that the public-key cryptosystem is playing a pivotal role to provide the security services not only in electronic world but also for secured key exchanges in military applications. Modular exponentiation is the crucial, but expensive, operation in several public-key cryptostyems, which makes use of repeated modular multiplications. So, the performance of public-key cryptography is highly influenced by the competent implementation of modular exponentiation. In order to speed up the entire process, it is essential to develop the modular exponential algorithms, which reduces the frequency of modular multiplications, and the time required to implement each modular multiplication. In this paper, we present the bit forwarding (BFW) techniques to reduce the count of modular multiplications for hardware implementation of modular exponentiation. Montgomery multiplication method is customized according to the needs of BFW techniques and implemented with radix-2, named as adaptable Montgomery multiplication, and also implemented with high radix and named as adaptable high-radix Montgomery multiplication. It has been computed that it is possible to reduce 11.16%, 15.14% and 18.20% of modular multiplications by BFW1, BFW2, and BFW3 algorithms, respectively, for 1024-bit exponent in comparison with prevailing techniques. This reduction will result in increased throughput and decreased power consumption. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Glass Fibre Reinforced Plastic (GFRP) composites show a tremendous increase in applications due to their superior properties. Some damages on the surface occur due to their complex cutting mechanics in cutting process. Minimization of the machining force is fairly important in terms of product quality. In this study, a GFRP composite material with 15°, 60° and 105° were milled to experimentally minimize the cutting forces on the machined surfaces, using solid carbide end mills with 25°, 35° and 45° helix angles at different combinations of cutting parameters. Experimental results showed that the machining force increased with increasing fibre orientation and feed rate; on the other hand, it was found that the machining force decreased with increasing cutting speed and helix angle of the end mill cutter. In addition, analysis of variance (ANOVA) results clearly revealed that the helix angle of the end mill cutter was the most influential parameter affecting the machining force in end milling of GFRP composites. A model based on an artificial neural network (ANN) is introduced to predict the machining force of GFRP with three different fibre orientations. This model is a feed forward back propagation neural network with a set of machining parameters as its inputs and the machining force as its output. Levenberg–Marquardt learning algorithm was used in predicting the machining force to reduce the number of expensive and time-consuming experiments. The highest performance was obtained by 4-18-18-1 network structure. ANN was notably successful in predicting the damage factor due to higher R2 and lower RMSE and MEP. © 2015 Engineers Australia.},

abstract={Agro-food byproducts such as coconut shell (Cocos nusnucifera L.) and groundnut hull (Arachis hypogea L.) have been considered as waste materials and hence if they are not handled properly, they would cause severe environmental problems. One of the interesting approaches is to use them as natural antioxidants for the development of nutraceuticals. Hence, in the present study we have focused on the recovery of polyphenol compounds from coconut shell and groundnut hull using different treatments and evaluated their antioxidant potential. Polyphenol compounds were isolated using solvent extraction with/without shaking and acid/alkali hydrolysis and their total phenolic content was analyzed using Folin-Ciocaltue method and antioxidant power using DPPH radical scavenging activity. Alkali hydrolysis was found to be efficient in the recovery of total phenolic compounds of coconut shells (950.25 mg GAE/100 g) as well as ground nut hull (94.00 mg GAE/100 g), but the antioxidant power was higher in acid hydrolysis of coconut shells (82.59%) and groundnut hull (73.65%). Both coconut shell and ground nut hull exhibited 57.1 and 70.0% inhibition of lipid peroxidation, respectively in model food system. Between the two investigated agro-food byproducts, groundnut hull revealed maximum inhibition of lipid peroxidation andhence it could be considered as a potential source of antioxidants for the development of nutraceuticals. © 2017, Global Research Online.

abstract={The scarcity of known petroleum reserves makes renewable energy resources more important. The most feasible way to meet this growing demand is by utilizing alternative fuels. Biodiesel is mono-alkyl esters of vegetable oils or animal fats. Biodiesel is the best alternative for diesel engines. The biggest advantage that biodiesel has over gasoline and diesel is that it is environmental friendly. Biodiesel burns similar to dieselas it concerns regulated pollutants. On the other hand, biodiesel probably has better efficiency than diesel. In the present study, Tamanu oil was selected as an alternative fuel which was produced by esterification and transesterification methods. The objective of the present study was to analyse the performance, emission characteristics in a single cylinder diesel engine with esterified tamanu oil and its blend with standard diesel. In addition to that turbocharger was fitted to the CI engine and their performance and emission characteristics were compared with and without turbocharger. The performance parameters indicated thermal efficiency, brake thermal efficiency, specific fuel consumption, volumetric efficiency and emission parameters included CO, CO 2 HC, and NO concentrations. The results of the experiment were analyzed and it confirmed to considerable improvement with turbocharger using biodiesel blend in the performance parameters, as well as in reduced exhaust emissions. © 2016 Triveni Enterprises, Lucknow (India).},

abstract={A recommender system is a type of system which performs filtering of information and produces useful inferences. In Indian classical music, a raga is a series of swaras (musical notes) in a particular order. Many musicians of Indian classical music follow the practice of transitioning from one raga to another while singing. The source raga and the destination ragas resulting from the transition have relationships with each other. In this research article, Carnatic music which is a form of Indian classical music, is taken as an application and a recommender system is proposed using methodologies related to Artificial Intelligence and other domains, like First Order Logic (FOL), gauging using distance measures and chi-square distribution in order to determine the destination ragas and their relationships with the source raga. Among the ragas which can be reached from a particular raga by raga-to-raga transition, the best-fit destination raga(s) are found out using distance measures. As an analysis of the gap between the source and destination ragas, one-way chi-square distribution is deployed. The hypothesis is tested for accuracy using confusion matrix. The application of this recommender system is to provide a list of all possible destination ragas reachable from an input source raga, thereby proving to be of great use to musicians, Music Information Retrieval (MIR) systems, automatic music creation software etc. © 2006-2016 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).},

abstract={In this work, a multi objective optimization on novel insulated roof with solar water heating system, at low material cost has been carried out through Taguchi based grey relational analysis technique. The novel roof have concrete, insulating polyurethane, and a channel of water in a metallic pipe tunnelling the chromium block. Chromium block is used to conduct more heat to raise the water temperature relatively high. On the other hand, roof with such high conductive material gains more indoor heat and this can be reduced by providing insulation material at the bottom of the roof. Performance of such a novel roof on water heating and heat insulation have been studied and improvided for the months of December and May respectively. In this multi objective optimization study, chromium block thickness, polyurethane layer thickness, pipe material and pipe diameter are considered as control parameters and varied for three levels. Taghuchi's L9 orthogonal array has been employed and the performance of novel roof patterns is studied through numerical simulation. The optimized novel roof raises the water temperature by 44°C in December and maintains the room temperature at 28°C in the month of May which is 3°C lesser than the conventional roof. Finally ANOVA is employed to identify the contribution of each control parameter on overall multiple objective function.},

abstract={Volatilization of organic pollutants due to their disposal or leaks and spills is one of the important contributors to their presence in the atmosphere. The transport of chemicals through porous soil occurs: (1) vapor diffusion; (2) liquid diffusion; and (3) mass transfer during upward liquid water flow. Because of their toxicity, volatilization of poly aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from crude oil and poly-chlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) from PCB mixture into the atmosphere is a significant issue. In this paper, the volatilization fluxes of semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs), specifically PAHs and PCBs are estimated. The mathematical model accounts for pore water movement upward towards the surface, biodegradation of the organics and a stagnant air boundary layer across which diffusion occurs, at the surface. Assuming a certain depth of contamination due to leaks and spills, the volatilization flux was predicted as a function of time. The results showed that lower ringed PAHs and less chlorinated PCBs tend to volatilize faster, compared to higher changed PAHs. It was also observed that volatilization rates decreased over time. Factors significantly affecting flux including soil moisture content, pore water flow and depth of contamination were varied to determine changes in volatilization flux.},

In this paper, CT images for brain diseases are classified by using feature selection algorithms such as Fisher Criterion and Genetic Optimization and Particle Swarm Optimization. The K-NN classifier is used for classifying the brain disease images based on the selected features. The type of brain disease is found using both the algorithms (FIG+KNN and PSO+KNN). Both the algorithms are compared by using its performance measures such as Specificity and Accuracy then the optimal one is found. It is proven that the feature selection algorithm PSO using K-NN gives better classification than that of FIG using K-NN.},

A misfunction of such ligand may affect the function of the Gene which could be altered using similar ligands. The domain for the similar ligands can be identified using Microarray, which is the high throughput technique used for measuring expression levels of very short sections of a Gene. Misfunction of DNA repair genes causes major diseases, one such mechanism that is taken under consideration is Base Excision Repair (BER). In order to find the similar ligands for DNA repair Genes, we designed a tool where the gene name is inputted. A cluster plot is generated for the protein products of the Gene inputted with respect to its functions. Using the microarray data a high expression profile is constructed and the domain is extracted. The list of possible similar ligands is obtained along with the domain, which forms their site of action. We have thus stratified a methodology to accomplish all these tasks. Results had 95% and above similarity with original ligands. It thereby reduces the search time to a greater extent. The plots comfort the user with better understanding about the Gene products and its expressions levels.},

abstract={Epilepsy is an unusual brain activity due to abnormal behavior of neuronal discharge which occurs from concurrent seizures. The electroencephalogram (EEG) is a test that measures the electrical movement in the brain. The main objective of this EEG analysis is to introduce some novel methods for seizure detection and to compare the performance of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier kernels. The 8 statistical features namely mean, standard deviation, median, mode, skewness, kurtosis, maximum and minimum and the 4 Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) features namely contrast, correlation, energy and homogeneity are extracted from each segment of the EEG signal which are analyzed and classified using two different SVM kernels. The Linear and Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernels are used with the SVM classifier. The performance of the kernels is compared and concluded that the linear kernel is the best choice for this study of seizure detection. Further in this analysis, the parameter sigma in RBF kernel is tuned to the value two and compared with the default sigma value one. It seems that the accuracy is better in classification when the sigma value is tuned.},

abstract={In the present world of extensively expanding data, there is an existing need for the continual identification of the drug targets of these pathogens which has been endowed with an easier solution by the sequencing of the proteomes of various micro-organisms. Hence, an in silico approach that provides an automated prediction of potential drug targets for a wide range of pathogens, employing proteome based analysis, would be the most imperative requirement with respect to the drug discovery process. This in silico approach has been implemented in the server by a three step pipeline i)identifying the non-homologous proteins of the pathogens in comparison to the host,ii) verifying the essential proteins and iii)asserting that the proteins are involved with the pathogen specific pathways exclusive of the host pathways. The validation step was performed by subjecting the predicted drug targets to CELLO server. Three case studies (Mycobacterium tuberculosis - reviewed, Vibrio cholerae - unreviewed and reviewed) were used to execute the three step procedure and the predicted drug targets were found to be prevalent in cytoplasmic and membrane regions of the cell thereby confirming their effectiveness.This automated computational framework will play an vital role in Bioinformatics applications.},

abstract={Now-a-days, lots of images, which are very personal or confidential, are being transmitted over the internet either among individuals or companies. At the same time, attacks on those images are also increasing day-by-day. Hence to protect the contents of the image, many image encryption algorithms are evolving where most of them transform the original image to a noise- like or texture -like image. But this is an obvious visual sign indicating the presence of an encrypted image and thus results in a significantly large number of attacks. To overcome this problem, our algorithm generates a new image encryption concept to transform an original image into a visually meaningful encrypted one where a visually meaningful or good-looking encrypted image (VMEI) is produced that has a high possibility of being treated as an encrypted one. This would significantly reduce the risk of an encrypted image being attacked and modified. The algorithm also uses Lifting wavelet transform for further enhancement of the VMEI. At last the image sharpening is done to enhance the final image.},

abstract={The proliferation of forums and blogs leads to challenges and opportunities for processing large amounts of information. The information shared on various topics often contains opinionated words which are qualitative in nature. These qualitative words need statistical computations to convert them into useful quantitative data. This data should be processed properly since it expresses opinions. Each of these opinion bearing words differs based on the significant meaning it conveys. To process the linguistic meaning of words into data and to enhance opinion mining analysis, we propose a novel weighting scheme, referred to as inferred word weighting (IWW). IWW is computed based on the significance of the word in the document (SWD) and the significance of the word in the expression (SWE) to enhance their performance. The proposed weighting methods give an analytic view and provide appropriate weights to the words compared to existing methods. In addition to the new weighting methods, another type of checking is done on the performance of text classification by including stop-words. Generally, stop-words are removed in text processing. When this new concept of including stop-words is applied to the proposed and existing weighting methods, two facts are observed: (1) Classification performance is enhanced; (2) The outcome difference between inclusion and exclusion of stop-words is smaller in the proposed methods, and larger in existing methods. The inferences provided by these observations are discussed. Experimental results of the benchmark data sets show the potential enhancement in terms of classification accuracy. © 2016, Journal of Zhejiang University Science Editorial Office and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Objective: Pharmaceutical sector is playing a key role toward the wellness of the people and economic development of India. The innovation, development, production, and marketing of medicines are accountable to the pharmaceutical industry. It is the duty of the government to ensure the availability of the lifesaving drugs at reasonable prices by means of considering the interest of both the producers and the buyers. To safeguard the public health, the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) is the watchdog in India, which controls the prices of drugs. The main objective of this study is to ascertain the various roles played by the NPPA, to control the prices of the drugs in India. Methods: Data and information about “Revenue of Indian Pharmaceutical Sector,” Pharmaceutical and Healthcare Industry in India, NPPA, and Drug Price Control Order (DPCO) were collected and used for this study. This study is based on the information from various secondary sources. Results: In India, prices of the medicines are controlled, and price maximum for the essential medicines are set by the Indian government using DPCO. List of drugs in the National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM) is expanded. In India, NPPA controls the prices of NLEM and also controls the price increases of non-essential medicines. Conclusion: Pharmaceutical companies can think of reducing the expenses to reduce the cost of drugs to comply with the government drug pricing policy. To ensure the affordability of medicines along with the pricing policy, the Indian government may look and concentrate on the other important areas of pharmaceutical sectors. © 2016 The Authors.

abstract={The impact of internet and information systems across various domains have resulted in substantial generation of multidimensional datasets. The use of data mining and knowledge discovery techniques to extract the original information contained in the multidimensional datasets play a significant role in the exploitation of complete benefit provided by them. The presence of large number of features in the high dimensional datasets incurs high computational cost in terms of computing power and time. Hence, feature selection technique has been commonly used to build robust machine learning models to select a subset of relevant features which projects the maximal information content of the original dataset. In this paper, a novel Rough Set based K – Helly feature selection technique (RSKHT) which hybridize Rough Set Theory (RST) and K – Helly property of hypergraph representation had been designed to identify the optimal feature subset or reduct for medical diagnostic applications. Experiments carried out using the medical datasets from the UCI repository proves the dominance of the RSKHT over other feature selection techniques with respect to the reduct size, classification accuracy and time complexity. The performance of the RSKHT had been validated using WEKA tool, which shows that RSKHT had been computationally attractive and flexible over massive datasets. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Purpose: Vascular calcification (VC) is an impact of calcium accumulation in end-stage renal diseases, normally initiated in the mitochondria. Sodium thiosulfate (STS) is effective in rescuing mitochondrial function in the neurovascular complications associated with VC, but has limitation in protecting the cardiac mitochondria. However, the STS efficacy in restoring the renal mitochondrial function has not been studied, which is the primary focus of this study. Methods: Wistar rats (n = 6/group) were administered 0.75 % adenine in the diet for 28 days to induce renal failure. STS (400 mg/kg) was given in two regimens STS_Pre (preventive: along with adenine for 28 days) and STS_Cur (curative: 29th to 49th day). Renal failure was assessed by plasma and urinary markers. The effectiveness of treatment was assessed from oxidative stress, DNA damage, mitochondrial physiology and enzymology in the renal tissue. Results: 0.75 % adenine diet caused renal medullary swelling, tubular interstitial nephropathy and impaired renal function (creatinine, urea, uric acid and ALP), which were recovered after STS treatment. The renal failure was due to oxidative stress as measured by elevated malondialdehyde (29 %) and lowered reduced glutathione (27 %) levels. STS reduced the lipid peroxidation and significantly (p < 0.05) elevated the antioxidant enzymes. Further, it improved renal mitochondrial respiratory capacity by maintaining the hyperpolarized membrane potential and restored the complex enzyme activities. Absence of renal DNA fragmentation supports the above findings. Conclusion: STS protects the kidney by preserving renal mitochondria, in experimental adenine-induced vascular calcified rats. The efficacy was prominent when given after induction, i.e., in STS_Cur group. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={Histone acetyl transferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) are antagonistic enzymes regulating the turnover of histone acetylation thereby governing gene expression in a precise manner. Histone acetylation deregulation caused by aberrant expression of classical HDACs plays a crucial role in tumour onset and progression making these enzymes as striking targets for anticancer drugs and therapy. Small molecule inhibitors targetting HDACs (HDACi) have shown multiple biological effects including cell cycle arrest, differentiation and apoptosis in cancer cell models. The current review deals with the recently approved pan-HDAC inhibitor panobinostat (LBH589) and its antiproliferative activity against distinct cancers (breast, ovarian, lung and multiple myeloma). The intricate details about the different mechanisms triggered by panobinostat to exert cytotoxic effect in these cancers have also been provided. The article also highlights the different combination strategies of panobinostat which can be utilized for overcoming conventional therapy resistant cases and for achieving the enhanced therapeutic benefit from this marvelous inhibitor in the upcoming future. © 2016 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={Immense growth in network-based services had resulted in the upsurge of internet users, security threats and cyber-attacks. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have become an essential component of any network architecture, in order to secure an IT infrastructure from the malicious activities of the intruders. An efficient IDS should be able to detect, identify and track the malicious attempts made by the intruders. With many IDSs available in the literature, the most common challenge due to voluminous network traffic patterns is the curse of dimensionality. This scenario emphasises the importance of feature selection algorithm, which can identify the relevant features and ignore the rest without any information loss.

abstract={Multi drug resistant (MDR) pathogens pose a serious threat to public health since they can easily render most potent drugs ineffective. Efflux pump inhibitors (EPI) can be used to counter the MDR phenotypes arising due to increased efflux. In the present study, a series of dithiazole thione derivatives were synthesized and checked for its antibacterial and efflux pump inhibitory (EPI) activity. Among 10 dithiazole thione derivatives, real-time efflux studies revealed that seven compounds were potent EPIs relative to CCCP. Zebrafish toxicity studies identified four non-toxic putative EPIs. Both DTT3 and DTT9 perturbed membrane potential and DTT6 was haemolytic. Among DTT6 and DTT10, the latter was less toxic as evidenced by histopathology studies. Since DTT10 was non-haemolytic, did not affect the membrane potential, and was least toxic, it was chosen further for in vivo study, wherein DTT10 potentiated effect of ciprofloxacin against clinical strain of MRSA and reduced bacterial burden in muscle and skin tissue of infected zebrafish by ~ 1.7 and 2.5 log fold respectively. Gene expression profiling of major efflux transport proteins by qPCR revealed that clinical isolate of MRSA, in the absence of antibiotic, upregulated NorA, NorB and MepA pump, whereas it downregulates NorC and MgrA relative to wild-type strain of Staphylococcus aureus. In vitro studies with NorA mutant strains and substrate profiling revealed that at higher concentrations DTT10 is likely to function as a competitive inhibitor of NorA efflux protein in S. aureus, whereas at lower concentrations it might inhibit ciprofloxacin efflux through NorB and MepA as implied by docking studies. A novel non-toxic, non-haemolytic dithiazole thione derivative (DTT10) was identified as a potent competitive inhibitor of NorA efflux pump in S. aureus using in silico, in vitro and in vivo studies. This study also underscores the importance of using zebrafish infection model to screen and evaluate putative EPI for mitigating MDR strains of S. aureus. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Yttrium doped zinc oxide was prepared by microwave irradiation of Y (NO3)3·6H2O and Zn(NO3)2·4H2O as precursors, in ethanol–water medium. Highly polar ethanol–water medium (30/70, v/v) with hexamine and urea assist the formation of ZnO nuclei very rapidly in a specific fashion. Furthermore, Y3+ ions infiltration into Zn(OH)2 precipitate was facilitated by microwaves (2.45 GHz, 950 W). Yttrium doped nanocrystalline ZnO (ZnO-99 and ZnO-95) was formed with 1 and 5 mol% yttrium precursor. The powder was morphologically characterized with XRD, DLS, SEM and TEM. Photocatalytic activity of microwave treated Y3+ doped ZnO was tested by studying the oxidation of methylene blue solution in a batch reactor. The studies showed that the catalytic reaction followed second order kinetics. Based on the results obtained from photocatalytic studies, efficiencies of various ZnO samples were found to be in this order: ZnO-A &gt; ZnO-99 &gt; ZnO-95 &gt; ZnO-R that is, Y3+ doped ZnO was not as effective as commercial undoped ZnO. However, ZnO-95 had shown better stability, antiphotocorrosive nature and reusability among the samples tested in this study. © 2012},

abstract={In eukaryotes, transcriptional regulation occurs via chromatin remodeling, mainly through post translational modifications of histones that package DNA into structural units. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are enzymes that play important role in various biological processes by repressing gene expression. Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) is a known HDAC inhibitor that showed significant anti cancer activity by relieving gene silencing against hematologic and solid tumors. We have designed and synthesized a series of SAHA analogs C1–C4 and performed biological studies to elucidate its anti-cancer effects. It is observed that SAHA analogs significantly inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines HepG2 and SK-HEP-1. These analogs also showed non-toxic activity towards primary human hepatocytes, which describes its tumor specificity. SAHA analogs exhibited strong HDAC inhibition, which is 2–3 fold higher compared to SAHA. Moreover, these molecules induced hyper acetylation of histone H3 at various positions on the lysine residue. Further, it is observed that SAHA analogs are strong inducers of apoptosis, as they regulated the expression of various proteins involved in both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. Interestingly, SAHA analogs induced upregulation of tumor suppressor miRNAs by activating its biogenesis pathway. Further, it is confirmed by microRNA (miRNA) prediction tools that these miRNAs are capable of targeting various anti-apoptotic genes. Based on these findings we conclude that SAHA analogs could be strong HDAC inhibitors with promising apoptosis inducing nature in HCC. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016.},

abstract={Ho3+ substituted cobalt-zinc ferrite with a chemical formula Co0.7Zn0.3HoxFe2−xO4 (0≤x≤0.1) were synthesized by sol-gel method. Synthesized samples were characterized by using X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, Raman, Infrared and UV–visible spectroscopy. X-ray diffraction patterns show the formation of cubic spinel structure of all the synthesized samples. The gradual changes in the Raman spectra of Co-Zn ferrite were observed at higher level of Ho3+ substitution. The Raman band shows that there is a strong electron-phonon coupling in the investigated ferrite system and is the highest for the T3 2g mode as compared to A1g and T2 2g modes. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy shows that the vibration bands corresponding to Fe–O is slightly varied with the substitution of Ho3+ substitution. UV–visible spectra was studied by using the optical absorbance measurements in the wavelength ranges from 500 to 800 nm. The estimated energy band gap is found to increase from 1.72 to 1.84 eV with the increase in Ho3+ substitution. The elastic properties such as longitudinal velocity, shearing velocity, elastic constant, Poisson's ratio and Debye temperature were measured at room temperature by using the ultrasonic pulse transmission method. It is found that the elastic constant and Debye temperature decreased with the increase in Ho3+ substitution. A linear relationship between Debye temperature, elastic constant and average sound velocity with the Ho3+ substitution is observed and discussed in this manuscript. Dielectric properties have been investigated as function of frequency. The dispersion of the dielectric properties was discussed in the light of Koop's theory in accordance with the Maxwell-Wagner polarization. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.},

abstract={Objectives: The in vivo radio-protective effect of total triterpenes isolated from Ganoderma lucidum (Fr.) P. Karst was evaluated using Swiss albino mice, by pre-treatment with total triterpenes for 14 days, followed by a whole body exposure to γ-radiation. Methods: The activities of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and the level of reduced glutathione (GSH) were analysed in liver and brain homogenates. The extent of lipid and protein peroxidation was also estimated in liver and brain homogenates after irradiation. Protection of radiation-induced DNA strand breaks in peripheral blood lymphocytes and bone marrow cells was assessed using the comet assay. Results: Total triterpenes were highly effective in reducing the levels of lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation to near normal values in both liver and brain tissues. Total triterpenes, when administered in vivo, were also found to be successful in restoring the antioxidant enzyme activities and GSH level in liver and brain of irradiated mice. Administration of total triterpenes, prior to radiation exposure, significantly decreased the DNA strand breaks. Discussion: The results of the present study thus revealed the potential therapeutic use of Ganoderma total triterpenes as an adjuvant in radiation therapy. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is a multifactorial disease causing visual impairment in old age. Oxidative stress is one of the main contributors for the disease progression. Paraoxonase (PON), a HDL-resident antioxidant enzyme which removes oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL), which is not studied much in AMD. This study assesses the PON activities in relation to the lipid status and genetic variants in AMD patients. In this prospective case-control study, a total of 48 AMD patients and 30 unrelated healthy controls were recruited. The serum oxLDL and Plasma Homocysteine (Hcy) levels were estimated by ELISA. Plasma Homocysteine thiolactone (HCTL) was estimated by HPLC. Serum PON activities were estimated by spectrophotometry. PON gene expression was assessed by qPCR and protein expression by western blot, immunofluorescence and FACS analysis. Two known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the coding region of PON1, Q192R and L55M variants were checked in the AMD patients and controls and their association with PON activity and lipid levels were determined. Serum paraoxonase (PONase) and thiolactonase (PON-HCTLase) activities were significantly elevated in AMD patients than in controls apart from elevated serum levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), oxLDL. While serum LDL levels in AMD patients correlate positively with PON HCTLase activity, the serum high density lipoprotein (HDL) correlates with both PONase and PON-HCTLase activities. However, multiple regression analysis showed that, amongst the parameters, only serum TG was a significant risk factor for AMD, after adjusting for demographic parameters as well as cataract. PON2 was significantly increased at the level of gene expression (p = 0.03) as seen in circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of AMD patients possibly mediated by the transcription factor SP1, that showed 2-fold increase. PON1 and 2 protein expressions also showed significant increase in the PBMC of AMD patients. At serum level, PON1 protein was significantly increased in AMD patients. Cholesterol transporters such as CD36, SR-B1 and ABCA1 gene expressions were also found to be higher (1.5, 1.9 and 2.4-fold respectively) in AMD, though not statistically significant. While the wet AMD (CNV) was found to be associated with increase in oxLDL and serum PONase activity, the dry AMD was associated with increased HDL and serum PON-HCTLase activity. The genotype and allele frequencies of Q192R & L55M were not significantly different between AMD patients and controls. However, altered lipid status and PON activities were associated with the genotype in AMD patients. A higher enzyme activity was observed for the RR genotype of Q192R in the cohort, irrespective of case and control. Thus the PON genotype and phenotype seem to play a role in the pathogenesis of AMD. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Aims miRNAs are small non-coding RNA molecules that regulate post-transcriptional gene expression. Here we have made an endeavor to search whether any miRNAs are involved in the regulation of BMI1 in breast cancer that leads to mitochondrial dependent apoptotic cell death. Main methods Renilla luciferase reporter assay was performed to detect the ectopically expressed miRNAs that regulate the expression of 3′ UTR of BMI1. MTT assay was performed to check the cytotoxicity level. Western blotting and qRT-PCR were performed to check the expression of BMI1, pro-apoptotic, anti-apoptotic proteins and mRNA expression levels respectively. JC-1 staining, Caspase-3, Caspase-6/9 assay and mitochondrial cytosolic fractionation were performed to monitor mitochondrial dependent apoptosis. Wound healing assay was performed to investigate migration. All experiments were performed upon miR-15a and miR-16 overexpression in MCF-7, MDAMB-231 breast cancer cells. Key findings In MCF-7, MDAMB-231 breast cancer cells luciferase reporter assay confirmed the significant reduction of reporter activity upon co-transfection of 3′ UTR of BMI1 along with miR-15a and miR-16. miR-15a and miR-16 significantly down-regulated BMI1 protein and mRNA expression levels as well as anti-apoptotic protein BCL2 and up-regulated pro-apoptotic proteins. Ectopic expression of miR-15a, miR-16, increased mitochondrial ROS resulting in impaired mitochondrial membrane potential, followed by cytochrome-C release into the cytosol that activated Caspase-3 and Caspase-6/9 leading to intrinsic apoptosis. Additionally, it also inhibits migration. Significance Our results suggest that overexpression of miR-15a and miR-16 mediates down-regulation of BMI1, and leads to mitochondrial mediated apoptosis. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Galectin-3 is an important protein in molecular signalling events involving carbohydrate recognition, and an understanding of the hydrogen-bonding patterns in the carbohydrate-binding site of its C-terminal domain (galectin-3C) is important for the development of new potent inhibitors. The authors are studying these patterns using neutron crystallography. Here, the production of perdeuterated human galectin-3C and successive improvement in crystal size by the development of a crystal-growth protocol involving feeding of the crystallization drops are described. The larger crystals resulted in improved data quality and reduced data-collection times. Furthermore, protocols for complete removal of the lactose that is necessary for the production of large crystals of apo galectin-3C suitable for neutron diffraction are described. Five data sets have been collected at three different neutron sources from galectin-3C crystals of various volumes. It was possible to merge two of these to generate an almost complete neutron data set for the galectin-3C-lactose complex. These data sets provide insights into the crystal volumes and data-collection times necessary for the same system at sources with different technologies and data-collection strategies, and these insights are applicable to other systems.Perdeuteration, purification and the growth of large crystals of the carbohydrate-recognition domain of galectin-3C are described. Five neutron diffraction data sets have been collected at four neutron sources; these are compared and two are merged. © Manzoni et al. 2016.},

abstract={With the improvement in wireless technology, sensory devices are integrated with wireless devices forming wireless sensor network (WSN). Security is one of the major bottleneck for WSN, as they operate in unlicensed bandwidth. Implementing conventional security algorithm degrades the network performance due to high computational complexity and inherent delay is incurred for execution of the algorithms. In this context, a hybrid algorithm 'PRESENT-GRP' is proposed for facilitating light weight encryption in WSN. As sensor nodes are battery operated, optimization of power plays a major role in prolonging the networks lifetime. In this work, a lightweight security algorithm for low power devices which consumes relatively less memory is designed and the results are analyzed. Thereby the algorithm suggested, could facilitate resource constrained devices to share the sensed data in a secure manner. Hence, by the analysis in this work it determines that the proposed algorithm is robust against linear and differential attacks. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Arsenic in water is considered as a global problem affecting human health as well as world's economy. Intake of toxic arsenic leads to cytological effects leading to cancer and disorders such as black foot disease, hypertension and dermatitis. A low - cost spray deposited nanocauliflower like fluorine doped cadmium oxide (F-doped CdO) thin film based working electrode was developed to detect arsenic with lower detection limit. The structural properties of F-doped CdO thin film exhibited face centered cubic structure with high crystallinity. Morphological characterization of F-doped CdO highlighted the cauliflower like building blocks. F-doped CdO thin film showed a resistivity, sheet concentration and mobility of 0.13 Ω cm, 8.18 × 1012 cm-2 and 3151 cm2 V-1 s-1 respectively. F-doped CdO showed a redox peak at -0.10 and 0.05 V (vs Ag/AgCl) respectively without the use of arsenite oxidase or arsenate reductase enzymes and mediators. The redox reaction of arsenic was due to the inherent catalytic behaviour of F-doped CdO. The electrocatalytic activity of F-doped CdO helped in detecting arsenic with a detection limit of 4.55 × 10-3 ppb and a sensitivity of 5.747 × 10-3 μA ppb-1. This suggests, F-doped CdO electrocatalyst can replace electrodes such as platinum, gold and glassy carbon electrodes and can be operated at wider potential ranges. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={India is an agricultural country. Farmers are the life-blood of the nation. But the current condition of a farmer in India is very pathetic. Today farmers are not able to enjoy the yield produced by them. The farmers should be introduced to the modern farming techniques because upon their well-being depends the welfare of the nation. Here, ICT plays a very important role meeting these challenges. Precision farming and modern society can play important roles in promoting ICT in agriculture. But the adoption is very slow in nature due to the number of yet unresolved issues discussed in earlier developed projects. The paper presents a generic framework for e-agricultural system comprising of knowledge management and monitoring system and also gives a brief description of the application interface. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Most gazetteers have been built and maintained for the purpose of visualizing geographical location on the Geographical Information system (GIS) client. The advent of big data allows us to construct gazetteers by directly mining rich volunteered information from the web. In this, we propose a technique for extracting location based spatial information from the web documents and media services like flickr, twitter, facebook for construction of gazetteers. To achieve this, we need to search the web for existing data pertaining location. A web crawler (Google search engine) generates the web pages based on the location keyword given by the user and maintaining the index of the web pages and the proposed system passes it to the Hadoop environment. For further simplification, the name node transfers the index group of web pages to different data nodes for extraction of spatial information from the dynamic web documents that we gather using machine learning process. Each data node is then utilized for the generation of a common template. The common template allows the extraction of location based spatial information from the dynamic web documents and media services. Resultant information from the data node is further merged using map reduce algorithms and the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is produced which is then converted to Geo-Java Script Object Notation (JSON) format, thus aiding in the task of visualizing the extracted information on the GIS client. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Post-silicon debug is the vital part of the modern circuit design methodology. It is the process of eliminating bugs that have escaped from pre-silicon verification phase. One of the major challenges involved in this technique is lack of internal signal visibility. Selecting the internal signals is very difficult because of narrow down the signal path. A potential way to improve the visibility is to combine scan and trace signals. Existing methods are not proficient since they explore most of the dominate signals that fitted into the trace buffer. In order to overcome the drawbacks, this paper proposes a hybrid method called mixed-granularity which comprises both fine-grained and coarse grained architecture and also reduces the computation time. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={An efficient and selective procedure for the synthesis of epiminodibenzo[b,f][1,5]diazocines involving a AB2 three-component reaction is developed. Two equivalents of suitably substituted 2-aminoarylaldehydes reacted with arylamines in the presence of Yb(OTf)3 to afford the desired products in high yields. The reaction is highly atom-economic and waste-free, in addition to allowing the generation of two heterocyclic rings and four C-N bonds in a single operation. Significantly, this approach is complementary to the existing literature procedures, affording arylamine-derived products that could not be accessed previously. A plausible mechanism is proposed involving an imine formation-intermolecular annulation-intramolecular iminium ion cyclization sequence. © 2016 American Chemical Society.},

The key challenge of silicon validation is that it has limited observability and controllability of internal signals. To improve those, a profitable set of signals should be selected. An automated procedure is proposed to select those signals which are used to facilitate early malfunctions of the design. Given the input vector set to the design an error transmission matrix is generated. From that, both relatively independent and dependent flip-flops are identified for grouping the signals through Mixed-Integer Linear programming. This method precisely identifies the paths which improves observability and can speed up the process. © 2016 IEEE.},

The dc-dc converters with multiple outputs typically attempt to share the inductor current for varying loads and in turn necessitates accounting for cross regulation between the outputs. The philosophy envisages minimizing the output voltage variations to ensure a regulated output and augurs to reject line and load disturbances. It includes in its framework the design of a conventional PI controller, Fuzzy Logic Controller and Fuzzy based PI Controller. The simulation results of a single input dual output converter obtained from a MATLAB® platform reveal that the Fuzzy based PI controller offers low rise time, settling time, steady state error value in addition to enjoying a higher immunity to load/line variations when compared with other controllers. The test results obtained using hardware with Fuzzy based PI control algorithm implemented in 89C51 Micro Controller validate the simulated response. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Experiments were carried out on the preparation, thermophysical properties' measurement and application of surfactant-free, sand-propylene glycol-water nanofluids for solar energy collection. Thermal conductivity enhancement of 16.3% and viscosity reduction of 47% were observed for 2 vol % sand-PG-water nanofluid at 28 °C. Microconvection caused by Brownian motion was identified as one of the mechanisms of thermal conductivity enhancement. The relative viscosity of sand-propylene glycol-water nanofluid was less than 1 over a temperature range of 10–60 °C and sand nanoparticle concentration range of 0.5–2 vol %. The lower viscosity of sand-PG-water nanofluids in comparison to that of propylene glycol-water mixture is attributed to non-covalent interactions between sand nanoparticles and propylene glycol, leading to perturbation of hydrogen bonding network. The use of 2 vol % sand-PG-water nanofluid resulted in enhancement of heat transfer and solar energy collection by 16.5%. Our results demonstrate that sand-PG-water nanofluids are suitable for use as heat transfer fluid in solar collectors. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Amorphous GeSeS thin films are deposited for five different thicknesses using thermal evaporation technique and their microstructures are analyzed. The oscillations obtained in the optical transmittance spectra are resulted from the interference between the air-film and film-substrate interfaces. The observed decrease in the optical band gap with increase in the thickness of the film is associated with the change in the bonds formed in the structure of the network. Structural disorder like unsaturated bonds (dangling bonds) are studied by means of Tauc parameter (B1/2), Urbach energy (EU), and thermal diffusivity. The formation of heteropolar bonds become enormous for higher thickness of GeSeS thin films. From Raman spectra the bonds associated with symmetric stretching and tetrahedral units are discussed. Phonon-phonon scattering is the dominating mechanism which determines the phonon mean free path and hence the measured variation in thermal diffusivity. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Droplet cooling of metal surfaces is an important area of research in industrial applications such as material quenching, nozzle spraying, etc. Fluids (water) act as an excellent agent in heat transfer to remove excess heat in various processes by convection and conduction. Such cooling process varies the material properties. The bubbles formed during droplet impinging on the surface act as heat sink and causes variation of height and spreading radius of the droplet with increase in temperature. In the present work, an experimental study of the droplet impinging behavior on Aluminium and Cast iron surfaces is reported. The water droplets are made to fall on the surface of the specimens from a specific height, which also influences the spreading radius. The effect of temperature on droplet height and droplet spreading radius is detailed. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Processing in the powder metallurgy route has emerged as an economical process for the production of near net shaped components with a wide range of desired mechanical properties suitable for various applications of industrial needs. This research work was conducted with an objective of studying the improvisation of density and hardness of Copper-Aluminium alloy prepared by spark plasma sintering. Cu-Al alloy with a composition of 95% copper and 5% aluminium was prepared by SPS process. SPS is a low voltage, DC pulse current activated, pressure-assisted sintering, which enables sintering at lower temperatures and shorter durations. The combination offered by Cu-Al alloy of high strength and high corrosion resistance results their applications under a wide variety of conditions. The density and hardness of the prepared sample were measured by conducting appropriate tests. Apparently, the values of hardness and density of the specimen prepared by SPS seemed to be better than that of conventional sintering.

abstract={Syringe Pump is mainly used in microfluidics, where precise flow rate is required. Precise flow rate is achieved by using minimum torque and at low speed, for such requirements a mechanism has to be constructed. The input is from a stepper motor, so a rotary to linear motion converting mechanism is required, which will work efficiently on such low torque applications. This work mainly looks into feasibility of scotch yoke rather than conventionally used crank and slider mechanism. Scotch yoke is a rotary to linear conversion mechanism. It contains mainly two parts i) a rolling scotch and ii) a sliding yoke. The yoke is driven by a pin eccentrically placed on the scotch. Since proximity of the mechanism is nearer to the source, the loss accounted is less in the case of scotch yoke. In this work both crank-slider and scotch-yoke are examined through simulation using MSC ADAMS software and the maximum velocity of that can be achieved is obtained analytically through Kinematic analysis of scotch-yoke mechanism. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Forging is one of the important manufacturing process in which products like connecting rod, transmission shaft, clutch hubs and gears are produced. Finite element analysis (FEA) in forming techniques is of recent interest for the optimal design and determination of right manufacturing forming process. The data from the numerical results can help in providing the information for selecting the ideal process conditions. Thus aside from experimental values, simulation by the finite element analysis software's such as LS DYNA can be used for the analysis of strain distribution in forging processes. In the present work, Finite element simulation of open die forging of naval brass (ASTM B16) is done at an optimal temperature. An advanced multi physics simulation software package by the Livermore software technology cooperation LSTC - LS DYNA is utilized for the simulation of forging process. For the forging validation, experiment is conducted with a cylindrical billet having height 45 mm and diameter of 40mm. The numerical results are compared with that of experimental results carried out at the same temperature and dimensions for validation. The distribution of strain is analyzed. Energy analysis due to impact load is detailed. The simulation results are found to be in good agreement with the experimental results. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Background: RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) interact with their cognate RNA(s) to form large biomolecular assemblies. They are versatile in their functionality and are involved in a myriad of processes inside the cell. RBPs with similar structural features and common biological functions are grouped together into families and superfamilies. It will be useful to obtain an early understanding and association of RNA-binding property of sequences of gene products. Here, we report a web server, RStrucFam, to predict the structure, type of cognate RNA(s) and function(s) of proteins, where possible, from mere sequence information. Results: The web server employs Hidden Markov Model scan (hmmscan) to enable association to a back-end database of structural and sequence families. The database (HMMRBP) comprises of 437 HMMs of RBP families of known structure that have been generated using structure-based sequence alignments and 746 sequence-centric RBP family HMMs. The input protein sequence is associated with structural or sequence domain families, if structure or sequence signatures exist. In case of association of the protein with a family of known structures, output features like, multiple structure-based sequence alignment (MSSA) of the query with all others members of that family is provided. Further, cognate RNA partner(s) for that protein, Gene Ontology (GO) annotations, if any and a homology model of the protein can be obtained. The users can also browse through the database for details pertaining to each family, protein or RNA and their related information based on keyword search or RNA motif search. Conclusions: RStrucFam is a web server that exploits structurally conserved features of RBPs, derived from known family members and imprinted in mathematical profiles, to predict putative RBPs from sequence information. Proteins that fail to associate with such structure-centric families are further queried against the sequence-centric RBP family HMMs in the HMMRBP database. Further, all other essential information pertaining to an RBP, like overall function annotations, are provided.

abstract={To develop a potential inhibitor for glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII) effective against all the eight common genetic variants reported, PyMOL molecular visualization system was used to generate models of variants using the crystal structure of GCPII i.e. 2OOT as a template. High-throughput virtual screening of 29 compounds revealed differential efficacy across the eight genetic variants (pIC50: 4.70 to 10.22). Pharmacophore analysis and quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies revealed a urea-based N-acetyl aspartyl glutamate (NAAG) analogue as more potent inhibitor, which was effective across all the genetic variants of GCPII as evidenced by glide scores (−4.32 to −7.08) and protein-ligand interaction plots (13 interactions in wild GCPII). This molecule satisfied Lipinski rule of five and rule of three for drug-likeliness. Being a NAAG-analogue, this molecule might confer neuroprotection by inhibiting glutamatergic neurotransmission mediated by N-acetylated alpha-linked acidic dipeptidase (NAALADase), a splice variant of GCPII. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

Henceforth the goal of this research is to obtain optimal parameters using FO PID controllers. It shows better disturbance rejection and has more degree of freedom in designing the controllers. In Non-Linear systems like conical tank, the level changes with respect to cross sectional area, thus making it highly non-linear. Thus the controller designing for conical tank is tedious and complex process due to nonlinear behavior.

abstract={The present study employed the spectroscopic techniques, i.e. fluorescence, and circular dichroism (CD) and the molecular docking approach to investigate the mechanism of interaction of a potent anticancer glucosinolate, sinigrin (SIN), with bovine serum albumin (BSA). SIN binding to BSA resulted in the quenching of intrinsic fluorescence, and the analysis of results revealed the presence of static quenching mechanism. Based on the results, it was evident that the interaction of SIN with BSA was mainly stabilized by hydrogen bonding. Results from CD analysis revealed that the binding of SIN does not induce significant conformational changes in BSA. Molecular docking studies showed that four hydrogen bonds stabilize the binding of SIN in the site I of BSA with a binding energy of −6.2 kcal mol−1. These findings will not only provide insights about the mechanism of interaction of sinigrin but also showed the effect of methylglyoxal-mediated glycation on ligand binding with BSA. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Aim: Dasamula is an Ayurvedic formulation, which is used for the management of pain, arthritis, and inflammatory disorders. Even though this formulation has been widely used in the Ayurvedic system of medicine to cure inflammation-mediated diseases, no deeper research studies have been conducted to prove its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Materials and Methods: In the present study, Dasamula was prepared using the roots of available herbal ingredients of such as Bilva (Aegle marmelos L. Correa), Syonaka (Oroxylum indicum L. Benth. Ex Kurz), Gambhari/Kumil (Gmelina arborea Roxb.), Patala/Pathiri (Stereospermum suaveolens Roxb.), Agnimantha/Munjai (Premna serratifolia L.), Salaparni/Orilai (Desmodium gangeticum L. DC), Prisniparni/Sithirapaladai (Uraria picta Jacq. Desv), Brhati/Sundai (Solanum indicum L.), Kantakari/Vaizhalanthai (Solanum xanthocarpum L.) and Goksura/Nerinjil (Tribulus terrestris L.) and screened for phytochemical profile, total phenol content, antioxidant activity (1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl assay), and anti-inflammatory property (red blood cell membrane stabilization assay). Results and Discussion: From the results, it was seen that Dasamula had an impeccable anti-inflammatory activity. The Dasamula preparation contains various phytochemicals such as alkaloids, tannins, saponins, flavonoids and quinones, total phenolic content (567 mg gallic acid equivalent/100 g) and exhibits antioxidant (44.86%) and anti-inflammatory activities (32.56%), which are contributed by its herbal ingredients, especially A. marmelos and G. arborea. Conclusion: Among the roots of 10 different herbal ingredients are used in the preparation of Dasamula, only A. marmelos and G. arborea root extracts are found to be efficient as anti-inflammatory agents, and the remaining ingredients might have some medicinal roles in related therapeutic conditions/alleviating side effects. © 2016 BRNSS Publication Hub.

abstract={In this paper, we present a new method based on the fractional shifted Legendre polynomials to solve non-homogeneous space and time fractional partial differential equations (FPDEs) in which space and time fractional derivatives are described in the Caputo sense. The main purpose of this technique is to transform the FPDE into algebraic equations which can be solved easily. Convergence and error analysis show the correctness and feasibility of the method. The applicability and efficiency of the proposed approach are illustrated by some examples.},

abstract={The reliability of a system can be improved by designing it with relevant fault-tolerant approaches. The hardware redundancy is often used technique to mitigate errors in a system by placing duplicate copies of original modules. The faults are masked using this kind of passive redundancy approach instead of detecting errors with the help of majority voting circuit. So the reliability of this voter is more important. This study exemplifies five different self-checking voter circuits by means of computing majority and minority and with relevant additional logic in each. Self-checking voter circuits are implemented using mirror concept, mux-and-or approach, mux-xor approach, conventional approach and Manchster carry style. The critical path delay, power dissipation, layout area, number of transistors and figure-of-merit (FOM) are the performance metrics for a comparative study. Simulation results are obtained using Microwind layout editor tool with 120 nm, 90 nm and 70 nm CMOS process technologies. The approach using Manchester carry obtain better FOM (78.85), least layout area (227.0 μm2), lower power dissipation (8.464 μW) as compared with other circuits. The Mux-and-or circuit obtains lower critical path delay (0.420 ns) as than other approaches. © 2016, Institute of Integrative Omics and Applied Biotechnology. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In recent years, the high speed adders play a vital role in any digital design of signal processing systems by performing much needed operations like subtraction, multiplication, and division, etc., along with the basic addition. Carry look-ahead adder (CLA), carry select adder (CSeA), carry-save adder (CSA) and carry-skip adder are the most popular high speed adders in digital signal processor and computer data path applications. This study demonstrates the efficiency of a carry-save adder with multi-operand addition using different majority voting circuit implementations in the place of carry out of a full adder. The carry is saved and propagated down to the next stage rather than passing within the same stage like in ripple carry adder (RCA). But the final sum is calculated with the help of carry ripple adder by propagating the carries appropriately. The final sum calculation stage in a carry save adder is implemented in this study using ripple carry adder (CSA-RCA), carry look-ahead adder (CSA-CLA) and carry select adder (CSA-CSeA) to compare better power, area and delay results. Addition of four 4-bit numbers, four 8-bit numbers, four 16-bit numbers, four 32-bit numbers and four 64-bit numbers are implemented on Altera EP4CE115F29C7 FPGA device using Quartus II synthesis software tool. Simulation results of adding four 32-bit numbers show that CSA-CSeA topology offers lower critical path delay as 34.823 ns compared with CSA-RCA topology (63.120 ns) and CSA-CLA topology (52.475 ns) at the expense of 221 logic elements (LEs) which is higher; the CSA-RCA topology and CSA-CLA topologies have only 192 LEs and 193 LEs respectively. It is also shown that the CSA-CLA topology has lower power dissipation as 170.54 mW compared with CLA-RCA (171.36 mW) and CSA-CSeA (174.68 mW). © 2016, Institute of Integrative Omics and Applied Biotechnology.

Thus there is a requisite for integrity for information to be transmitted over an insecure channel. Thus image/text encryption plays a vital preprocessing role in contemporary data transmission. Method: This paper analyses the performances of four novel, lossless methodologies of implementing the enhanced Playfair cipher in spatial and frequency domains, with integer wavelet transform (IWT) through lifting scheme. Findings: The proposed methods involve a spatial domain algorithm being applied to the frequency domain of the images for encryption which gives out better desired error metrics. Application: The most feasible method out of these proposed approaches can be chosen either as a stand-alone encryption and transmission mechanism or a pre-requisite step for that specific image in steganography and watermarking.},

abstract={The number of diabetes mellitus cases is rapidly increasing worldwide and its complications are a major cause of disability and hospitalization,posing a significant financial burden. Diabetes mellitus is a complex and a fast growing medical problem throughout the globe,in both developed and developing countries. As per WHO report,diabetes is a multifarious group of disorders that disturbs the metabolism of carbohydrates,fat and protein and results in a shortage or lack of insulin secretion and/or reduced sensitivity of the tissue to insulin. In order to manage the diabetic condition,various synthetic drugs have been developed,but each has their own drawbacks / side effects. So,the natural way of treating / managing diabetic condition through medicinal herbs received attention all over the world. In India,certain herbs like Andrographis paniculata,Cassia auriculata,Curcuma longa,Murraya koenigii,Phyllanthus emblica,Trigonella foenum-graecumandSalacia oblongahavebeen employed to manage diabetic condition in various traditional systems of medicine. Even though several research woks have been conducted on the efficacy of these medicinal plants,information are scattered. Hence,the present review focused on summation of anti-diabetic potential of medicinal herbs which are used in Indian system of medicine with scientific evidences. © 2016,Pharmainfo Publications.

Inductor, the passive component is one of the important elements in most of the circuit. But the application of inductor at low and very low frequencies is very much constricted due to large number of turns required. This stops its realization in integrated circuits and is not comfortable with newest IC technology. In this paper a different way of simulating L is presented. It is called simulated inductor or synthetic inductor. It uses two op-amps and few passive components. The application of this simulated L in analog filters and the frequency response of those filters are presented. The simulation is done in PSPICE. The experimental results are also shown to validate the use of this simulated inductor. © 2006-2016 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).},

The main objective of this research work is to develop a novel two way decision model that integrates the two dominant decision making methods namely Analytical Hierarchical Processing (AHP) and Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), for solving team selection problem (TSP). The AHP is used for choosing optimal weights and the TOPSIS is used for choosing optimal compromise solution. We combine the creditability of the two methods to propose a hybrid decision making model (DMM).

abstract={The simultaneous flow of two different phases is referred to as two phase flow. In the present study, a technique is developed for the identification of Air-Water two phase flow regimes using Infrared sensor. Experiments were done in a 4.7 mm borosilicate glass tube with a wall thickness of 0.3 mm. An Infrared (IR) emitter is used to send IR rays continuously. This IR ray is refracted by passing through the glass tube and the flowing medium. The refraction results in variation in current flowing through the IR receiver which is recorded online using data acquisition system. Bubbly, Slug and Stratified flow regimes were identified from the variation in current. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling of two phase flow inside the tube of same dimension was done using Volume of Fluids (VOF) method. Numerical simulations were carried out in Fluent 2D for the same superficial liquid and gas velocities as in the experiments. The results of the IR sensor and the Volume of Fluids method were compared with high speed photography of the two phase flow patterns. The flow patterns identified using IR sensor are in good agreement with the results of VOF method and high speed videography. © 2016},

abstract={The aqueous extract of Terminalia chebula Retz. plays an important role in traditional medicinal formulations. Experiments on microwave irradiation during aqueous extraction of flavonoids from T. chebula reveal the influence of microwaves on solid-liquid equilibrium, leading to higher equilibrium flavonoid concentration in the liquid phase at a fixed flavonoid concentration in the solid phase. As a result, microwave assisted extraction (MAE) provided 14.17% enhancement in equilibrium yield, compared to that obtained in conventional extraction at a temperature of 100 °C and a solvent-to-feed ratio of 40 mL/g. The effective diffusion coefficient at 40 mL/g increased from 0.68 × 10 −11 to 1.31 × 10 −11  m 2 /s due to microwave irradiation. Our data conclusively indicates that microwave assisted extraction provides higher yield, equilibrium concentration and effective diffusion coefficient. The study has also revealed the possibility of utilization of MAE for short duration extraction with lower solvent and energy consumption. The extractions were found to be endothermic and spontaneous, with the spontaneity improved due to microwave irradiation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Information security, though having different areas of interest, is fairly specific and confined to secure digital data transmission. Currently, there are many data security techniques addressing various aspects of secured information sharing. Amongst those, one that is sufficiently epic, successful and challenging is steganography. This paper proposes a robust adaptive image steganography scheme titled the adaptive random inverted key LSB substitution technique, which combines steganography and cryptography to enhance the security of confidential data and imperceptibility of the stego object. FPGA implementation of the steganography technique provides massively parallel operations, perfect shielding against infectious attacks and ease of embedding as a low-power hardware accelerator in mobile computing systems. Hence, the proposed algorithm is implemented on a Cyclone II FPGA. The synthesized result demonstrates that the FPGA architecture yields a throughput of 441.38 Mbps for data embedding and 914.29 Mbps for data extraction. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Context: The therapeutic potential of the genus Vernonia has been well documented over the years. However the pharmacological potential of the plant Vernonia arborea (Asteraceae) has been relatively less explored. Objective: To investigate the antiinflammatory effect of the ethanol leaf extract of V. arborea against formalin induced inflammation in rats. Materials and methods: Formalin induced inflammation method was used to induce inflammation in rats.0.1 ml/kg body weight (b.w.) of formalin was administered to the rats via sub-plantar injection to induce inflammation. The rats were pretreated with ethanol leaf extract of V. arborea at concentrations of 100, 200 and 300 mg/kg b.w. once daily for 30 days. Indomethacin (25 mg/kg b.w.) was used as standard drug. Biochemical and hematological parameters along with levels of antioxidant enzymes were evaluated. Results: Administration of formalin reduced antioxidant enzyme levels, total RBC and Hb. Pretreatment with ethanol leaf extract of V.arborea at dose dependent levels significantly increased (p<0.05)the levels of the above parameters. A significant increase (p<0.05) in paw thickness, level of serum enzymes (Aspartate transaminase, Alanine transaminase, Alkaline phosphatase and Creatine kinase), Lipid peroxide and leucocytes was observed in the rats induced with formalin, while these levels were normalized on pretreatment with ethanol leaf extract of V.arborea. Conclusion: The results of the present investigation demonstrate the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potential of the ethanol leaf extract of V.arborea. However, it is imperative to isolate and purify the active principles involved in the pharmacological potency of this plant and determine its mechanism of action. © 2016, Association of Pharmaceutical Teachers of India.

abstract={Background: Present study deals with the prediction of nitrogen oxides in the vicinity of the Rayalaseema Thermal Power Project, Andhra Pradesh, India. It provides information to the public and the control agencies to efficiently implement the control strategies of the air quality management program. Methods: In this prediction, the industrial source complex short-term version 3 (ISCST3) model was used. ISCST3 is the preferred model of USEPA. ISCST3 is a refined dispersion modeling technique using site specific input data. Findings: Predictions were made around the power plant with the radius of 10,000 meters; for the period of one year from June 2012 to May 2013. ISCST3 and Golden software surfer version 8 was used to produce Isopleths and 3-Dimensional view of No x in the vicinity of the Rayalaseema Thermal Power Project. Similarity beside measurements of Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Stations (AAQMS) was made. Genuine results were found well with measured data. Coefficients of determination (R 2 ) were found in the range between 0.76 to 0.96. The ISCST3 model can be used for No x prediction with good accuracy. Application and Improvement: Further forecasting can be carried out in coal fired power stations for using wide ranging parameters, which will have significant impact on human health and environment using ISCST3 modeling technique.},

abstract={For the past several decades, scientists have been exploring the possibilities of decoding the complex physical mechanism of the earthquake process using satellites and ground-based technologies. In recent years, use of satellite-based technologies has been preferred, since monitoring a broader region and round-the-clock surveillance is possible using geostationary satellites. Using sensors mounted on satellites, it is possible to observe anomalous thermal variations in both the atmosphere and the ground. Measurement of anomalous variations in outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) is one such technology used to identify earthquake preparation zones. Anomalous variations in OLR have been observed in the vicinity of the epicenter, 3 to 30 days prior to impending earthquakes. We have analyzed the OLR scenario for earthquakes with magnitude greater than 7.0 that occurred during April 2016. Analysis has been done to find the relationship between OLR flux variations and the magnitude of the earthquakes. From the analysis, we have found that the recurrence frequency of OLR anomaly and cumulative energy flux of OLR can give us vital clues about the probable magnitude of impending earthquakes. © 2016 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).},

abstract={Obesity is a significant risk factor for increased morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease and diabetes and it is also associated with many other medical conditions including cancer, liver and kidney diseases, sleep apnea, and depression. The inhibition of dietary fat absorption is a logical target for managing obesity and pancreatic lipase is a key enzyme involved in triglyceride absorption in the small intestine. Inhibitors of intestine lipases are suggested to function as antiobesity agents. Recently, studies have been intensified for new lipase inhibitors in natural resources with minimal adverse effect. In this view, attempts are made in the present study to evaluate antiobesity, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of four medicinal plants namely Acorus calamus, Alpinia galanga, Cinnamomum zeylanicum and Piper cubeba. From the results obtained, it can be concluded that total phenol content was more in Piper cubeba, lipase inhibitory activity was high in Acorus calamus, DPPH radical scavenging activity was more in Cinnamomum zeylanicum, inhibition of lipid peroxidation and stabilization of RBC membrane was maximum for the extract of Alpinia galanga. Hence, preparation of herbal formulation using the investigated plant drugs will leads to the development of effective anti-obese drug. © 2016, International Journal of Toxicological and Pharmacological Research.

abstract={Cardiotoxins (CTXs) belonging to the three-finger toxin superfamily of snake venoms are one of principal toxic components and the protein toxins exhibit membrane lytic activities when the venoms are injected into victims. In the present study, complex formations between CTX VI (a P-type CTX from Naja atra) and CTX1 (an S-type CTX from Naja naja) on zwitterionic POPC bilayers (a major lipid component of cell membranes) have been studied in near physiological conditions for a total dynamic time scale of 1.35 μs using all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Comprehensive analyses of the MD data revealed that residues such as Leu1, Lys2, Tyr11, Lys31, Asp57 and Arg58 of CTX VI, and Ala16, Lys30 and Arg58 of CTX1 were crucial for establishing interactions with the POPC bilayer. Moreover, loop I, along with globular head and loop II of CTX VI, and loop II of CTX1 were found to be the structural regions chiefly governing complex formation of the respective proteins with POPC. Rationalizations for the differential binding modes of CTXs and implications of the findings for designing small molecular inhibitors to the toxins are also discussed.

abstract={Herpes simplex virus causes serious and contagious genital infections in high percentage of female population world-wide. Acyclovir is a clinically successful antiviral molecule till date, in-spite of limitations as poor solubility, low half-life, reduced oral bioavailability and side effects at higher doses. In the present work, controlled release in situ gelling system loaded with polymeric nanoparticles of acyclovir containing a dose of drug equivalent to 105 mg/day has been developed. The formulation containing drug loaded polyvinyl pyrrolidone–Eudragit RSPO hybrid polymeric nanoparticles (Size ∼99 ± 3 nm, Zeta ∼+26.1 ± 1.5 mV) in 15% Pluronic F-127 gel exhibited improved permeability through vaginal membrane (KP = 2.20 ± 0.19 × 10−6 cm/s). The nanoparticles showed enhanced viability for vaginal epithelial cell lines up to concentration of 100–250 μg/mL. The formulation was evaluated for bioavailability and biodistribution through intra-vaginal administration in rat models. The nanoparticle in situ gel formulation maintained an average therapeutic drug level of 0.6 ± 0.2 μg/mL in plasma for 24 h. Significant improvement in mean residence time of the drug (12.52 ± 1.12 h) was observed with a two-fold increase in the relative bioavailability (AUC0–24 h = 14.92 ± 2.44 μg h/mL) compared to that of the pure drug (7.18 ± 1.79 μg h/mL). The tissue distribution was 2–3 folds higher in animals treated with nanoparticles in situ gel compared to that of pure drug. Sustained release of drug in vivo was demonstrated, ensuring the suitability of the formulation for clinical therapy in female population. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Nanotechnology in drug delivery is explored widely to improve therapeutic efficacy and minimize undesirable effects of several anti-HIV drugs. Efavirenz is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, prescribed as first-line drug of choice for treatment of AIDS. It is poorly soluble and exhibits variable bioavailability hence, a high oral dose is recommended for therapy. The present work focuses on improving the dissolution and bioavailability of Efavirenz through nano drug delivery approach. Polymeric nanoparticles were developed using Eudragit E100 and characterized for size, stability, morphology, cytotoxicity (MTT assay in T-lymphatic (C8166) cell lines) and in-vivo biodistribution in mice models. The optimized nanoparticles exhibited average particle size of 110 nm, zeta potential of - 33 mV and entrapment efficiency 99%. The SEM images displayed the formation of nano-size particles. The cell viability was significantly improved in the nanoparticles (99%) compared to pure drug (15%) at the concentration of 8 μg/mL. The in-vivo biodistribution profile of the nanoparticles showed considerably higher drug concentration in serum and major organs, especially in the brain compared to the free drug. The optimized Efavirenz loaded nanoparticles clearly demonstrated an increase in dissolution, drug distribution, and bioavailability, which implies better control over the therapeutic dosing. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Background/Objective: In power systems, the dispatch of real power plays a pivotal role in mitigating the transmission congestion, yet at a very low and affordable cost. Thus, in this paper, the rescheduling of real power generation has been dealt with a view to manage the congestion in transmission. Methods/Statistical Analysis: In this paper, the congestion management in a deregulated electricity market has been endeavored for the problems of Combined Economic and Emission Dispatch (CEED) by employing a novel technique of optimization through Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm. In a real time transmission system, the congestion is an inevitable condition that occurs when the power flow in the line exceeds than that of its limit. In this work, the optimized solution for CEED problem has been obtained via ABC algorithm. An encoding scheme based on generating unit is used. Findings: By employing a robust and efficient methodology using ABC algorithm, an optimal technique on congestion management has been proposed, which takes into account of corrective re-dispatch of real power through the transmission system, under the CEED - environment on a restructured power system. The proposed method has been tested on an IEEE 30-bus system and their results have also been validated to show the efficacy of the proposed methodology, which throw light upon the fact that it has emerged out as an effective tool in handling the transmission congestion in a deregulated environment that results in the minimization of cost of re-dispatch on one hand and in a secured operating condition on the other. Application/Improvements: This work can be extended in the future by including reactive power support, which can further minimize the total operating cost of the system.},

abstract={Aberrations in one-carbon metabolism were reported to increase breast cancer risk by influencing the DNA synthesis and methylation of DNA and catecholamines. However, the results of these association studies remain inconclusive. We have explored the contribution of eight genetic polymorphisms in modulating the susceptibility to breast cancer by performing a meta-analysis of worldwide studies. In total, 62 case-control studies representing 17 different populations involving 18,117 breast cancer cases and 23,573 healthy controls were included in this meta-analysis. Out of the eight polymorphisms analyzed, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T exhibited positive association with the breast cancer risk in both fixed effects (OR 1.14, 95 % CI 1.10–1.17) and random effects (OR 1.10, 95 % CI 1.02–1.18) models. Solute carrier family 19 (folate transporter), member 1 (SLC19A1) G80A exhibited positive association (OR 1.16, 95 % CI 1.03–1.31) while MTR A2756G exhibited an inverse association (OR 0.78, 95 % CI 0.75–0.82) with the breast in fixed effect model alone. Significant heterogeneity was observed in the association of MTHFR C677T with breast cancer even between studies from the same geographical area, specifically among Chinese, Indians, and Turks. Subgroup analysis revealed MTHFR C677T-mediated breast cancer risk in post-menopausal women and women with low dietary intake of folate. Geographical area wise segregation of data revealed MTHFR-mediated increased breast cancer risk in populations who consume methionine-rich diet. Altitude-level variations were observed in the association of SHMT1 C1420T with breast cancer. India and Brazil of same altitude showed an inverse association with this polymorphism, while USA and China that share similar altitude showed a null association. MTHFR C677T and SLC19A1 G80A are the two polymorphisms of one-carbon metabolic pathway that increase breast cancer in the worldwide population. Dietary patterns and altitudinal variations are the likely risk modulators that are contributing toward ethnic- and population-level variations in genetic associations. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={We investigate nonlinear localized magnetic excitations in a one-dimensional bicomponent magnonic crystal under a periodic magnetic field of spatially varying strength. The governing Landau-Lifshitz equation is transformed into a variable coefficient nonlinear Schrödinger (VCNLS) equation using stereographic projection. In general, the VCNLS equation is nonintegrable and by using Painlevé analysis, we obtain necessary conditions for the VCNLS equation to pass the Weiss-Tabor-Carnevale Painlevé test. A sufficient integrability condition is obtained by further exploring a transformation, which can map the VCNLS equation into the well-known standard nonlinear Schrödinger equation. The transformation builds a systematic connection between the solution of the standard nonlinear Schrödinger equation and VCNLS equation. The results show that the excitation of magnetization in the form of a soliton exists on the oscillatory background with a structure similar to the form of spin Bloch waves. Such a solution exists only when certain conditions on the coefficient of the VCNLS equation are satisfied. To corroborate the analytical results, we performed the numerical simulation by solving the governing VCNLS equation with integrability conditions using the split step Fourier method and the result agrees well with analytical results, and it suggests a way to control the dynamics of magnetization in the form of solitons by an appropriate spatial modulation of the nonlinearity coefficient in the governing VCNLS equation, which depends on the ferromagnetic materials which form the bicomponent magnonic crystal. © 2016 American Physical Society.},

abstract={India, the second continent successfully occupied by Homo sapiens sapiens, is known for its enormous diversities. This was the result of early migrations, autochthonous expansion, and cultural evolution. The first coastal out-of-Africa migration ∼60,000. ybp allowed humans to leave their trails of non recombinant Y chromosome (NRY) haplogroup (HG) signatures (C-M130, F*-M89) in the Western Ghats and various parts of India, which gave rise to further autochthonous evolution of the male gene pool. However, the female gene pools (mtDNA HG M and N) of early settlers were mostly derived from the early migration. Monsoons transformed the early settlers into hill tribes (characterized by NRY HGs F*-M89 and H*-M69) and dry land farmers (L1-M27), leading to sedentary lives. Subsequently, migration of the Neolithic cattle keepers and people with water-taming technology (characterized by NRY HGs J and R lineages, respectively) ushered in domestication along with river-fed and wet-land cultivation. The success of the resultant geographic demes was further augmented by the advent of languages. Language families correlated with one or the other NRY clade, namely, Dravidian languages correlated to NRYHG L1 dating to 30,000. ybp; Austroasiatic languages spoken in East India with O2a dating to 20,000. ybp; and Indo-European spoken in North India with R1a dating to 15,000. ybp. Cultural evolution, such as societal formation, religious ethos, etc., further crystallized this diversity in the recent past. Studies on the whole genome-NRY, mtDNA, major histocompatibility complex (MHC), and non-MHC genes-have supported this contention of migration, settlement, expansion, and sympatric isolation in India. These disparities determine and skew the spread and distribution of infectious and lifestyle diseases. The diverse population demes of India, living in the same milieu of epidemiology and sympatric isolation, are thus ideal models to test the immunogenetic dictum, "Not all the infected develop the disease" an earnest effort in this direction is needed. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={The isotropic nature of the sensing elements decides the overall sensing performance of metal oxide gas/chemical sensors. Even a minimum deviation in the morphological and electrical characteristics of the sensing surface will lead to a nonuniform sensing performance, which in turn results in undesired figure of merits. With this background, the inhomogeneity of plasma discharge due to the racetrack effect of the magnetic field orbit in the planar magnetron and its significant influence on the formation of nanostructured ZnO thin films with desired uniformity has been investigated. The effect of the intensity of plasma discharges on the structural studies was a change in crystallite size from 11 to 35 nm. Anisotropic characteristics of the film influenced the mobility of carriers (10 and 220 cm2 V-1 s-1) by populating the carrier concentration (2.13 × 1011 and 3.87 × 107 cm-2) in the nanostructures. Furthermore, the influence of this anisotropic surface of the obtained film on the room-temperature ethanol-sensing behavior is reported. The first observation of the racetrack effect on the sensing gradient of the sputter-deposited ZnO thin film has brought out the challenge in preparing an isotropic sensing element without anisotropy. © 2016 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Epidermal knockout of integrin β1 results in complete disorganization of the basement membrane (BM), resulting in neonatal lethality. Here, we report that this disorganization is exacerbated by an early embryonic inflammatory response involving the recruitment of tissue-resident and monocyte-derived macrophages to the dermal-epidermal junction, associated with increased matrix metalloproteinase activity. Remarkably, the skin barrier in the integrin β1 knockout animals is intact, suggesting that this inflammatory response is initiated in a sterile environment. We demonstrate that the molecular mechanism involves de novo expression of integrin αvβ6 in the basal epidermal cells, which activates a TGF-β1 driven inflammatory cascade resulting in upregulation of dermal NF-κB in a Tenascin C-dependent manner. Importantly, treatment of β1 KO embryos in utero with small molecule inhibitors of TGF-βR1 and NF-κB results in marked rescue of the BM defects and amelioration of immune response, revealing an unconventional immuno-protective role for integrin β1 during BM remodeling. © 2016 The Authors},

Steganography deals with concealing secret message in the image whereas cryptography is about altering the message into a distorted form, so that it is prevented from unauthorized access. Combining both the steganographic and cryptographic techniques will yield a secure and sophisticated system for exchanging the secret information between the sender and receiver. Quick Response codes, also known as two-dimensional barcodes are used for increased encoding space. In this paper, a secure information model is presented by combining cryptography and steganography. QR codes are employed for encoding the encrypted message. A nested image steganography is performed with QR codes on a suitable cover image. The proposed approach has a potential to be employed in communicating confidential information. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={The title compound, (2E)-2-(ethoxycarbonyl)-3-[(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]prop-2-enoic acid is characterized by means of X-ray crystallography, spectroscopic methods and quantum chemical calculations. The title compound crystallizes in centrosymmetric space group P21/c. Moreover, the crystal structure is primarily stabilized through intramolecular N-H⋯O and O-H⋯O and intermolecular N-H⋯O and C-H⋯O interactions along with carbonyl⋯carbonyl and C-H⋯C contacts. These intermolecular interactions are analysed and quantified by using Hirshfeld surface analysis, PIXEL energy, NBO, AIM and DFT calculations. The overall lattice energies of the title and parent compounds suggest that the title compound is stabilized by a 4.5 kcal mol-1 higher energy than the parent compound. The additional stabilization force comes from the methoxy substitution on the title molecule, which is evident since the methoxy group is involved in the intermolecular C-H⋯O interaction as an acceptor. The vibrational modes of the interacting groups are investigated using both experimental and theoretical FT-IR and FT-Raman spectra. The experimental and theoretical UV-Vis spectra agree well. The time dependent DFT spectra show that the ligand-to-ligand charge transfer is responsible for the intense absorbance of the compound. © 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Abstract: Cataract is one of the most important leading causes of blindness in the world. Extensive research showed that oxidative stress may play an important role in the initiation and progression of a cataract and other age-related eye diseases. Extra-generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in the eye tissue has been shown as one of the most important risk factors for cataracts and other age-related eye diseases. With respect to this, it can be hypothesized that dietary antioxidants may be useful in the prevention and/or mitigation of cataract. Lutein is an important xanthophyll which is widely found in different vegetables such as spinach, kale and carrots as well as some other foods such as eggs. Lutein is concentrated in the macula and suppresses the oxidative stress in the eye tissues. A plethora of literature has shown that increased lutein consumption has a close correlation with reduction in the incidence of cataract. Despite this general information, there is a negligible number of review articles considering the beneficial effects of lutein on cataracts and age-related eye diseases. The present review is aimed at discussing the role of oxidative stress in the initiation and progression of a cataract and the possible beneficial effects of lutein in maintaining retinal health and fighting cataract. We also provide a perspective on the chemistry, sources, bioavailability and safety of lutein. © 2015 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.},

abstract={Mitochondria are the key players of cardiac function and their dysfunction due to oxidative stress is implicated in myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury, one of the important mediators of cardiac mortality. The present study evaluates the mitochondrial protective effect of sodium thiosulfate on isolated cardiac mitochondria (interfibrillar mitochondria and subsarcolemmal mitochondria) subjected to oxidative stress by ischemia and reperfusion. Briefly, interfibrillar mitochondria and subsarcolemmal mitochondria were treated with cobalt chloride (500 µM) for 20 min to induce oxidative stress by chemical method and nitrogen gas purging for 20 min in an ischemic buffer was used for the physiological method. The mitoprotective effect of sodium thiosulfate was evaluated with different mode of sodium thiosulfate incubation (pretreatment, cotreatment and post treatment) with the mitochondria. The mitochondria led to an increased oxidative stress (measured by malondialdehyde, reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase) and decreased mitochondrial enzyme activities (measured by succinate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase and NAD+ dehydrogenase) with both the models and sodium thiosulfate treated groups showed significant improvement in the above alterations. By comparing the efficiency among the different modes of sodium thiosulfate treatment, we found that pretreatment renders significant (P<0.05) mitochondrial protection against ischemia reperfusion injury by nitrogen gas. However, no such differences were observed among the treatments in cobalt chloride mediated mitochondrial dysfunction. In summary, we found that sodium thiosulfate can modulate and preserve cardiac mitochondria for the treatment of myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury. © 2016, OMICS International.

abstract={Many of the mortality cases we see today especially in rural and remote areas are due to lack of proper medical facilities in emergency cases and lack of genuine information about hospital infrastructure and facilities i.e. whether the treatment for particular disease is available in the hospital they choose to go. In order to aid the decision making in choosing the correct hospital, a methodology based on Decision Tree Induction is adopted. Methods: It is based on the recent statistics about staff and infrastructure of hospitals. The core idea of "Decision Tree Induction Methodology" is to provide ranking for the hospitals based on the facilities available in the hospital. The methodology is applied on a set of hospitals in a location. Findings: The medical statistics and ranking plays a key role in the functioning of the methodology adopted. The data about facilities is gathered and fed to a trained paradigm which predicts the rank of a specific hospital. The representatives grasp the information from the GUI built for this methodology. Application: The result can be fed to all the possible medical centers so that public can get correct guidance from the representatives present there.},

abstract={The concept of caching the memory to speed up the memory transactions is not new. Cache memory at different levels help reduce the memory access time by different factors depending on the location of the cache in the system. Talking about a virtualization environment,wherein more than one OS run on a hypervisor,each OS has a dedicated L2 cache for its core and there exists a L3 cache or last level cache that is shared by all the OSes running on the hypervisor. Taking a particular case of a system with one Real-Time Operating System and one General Purpose Operating System sharing the last level cache,competition may arise. Problems like,inability to meet the deadlines by the processes in RTOS and performance aberrations in GPOS,can creep in due to inefficient sharing of last level cache. Cache Partitioning or CAP and Page-table Prefetching or PTP are two methods that overcome the mentioned problems one each. CAP approach is biased towards the GPOS whereas PTP approach favors the RTOS. Hence,there is a need for an approach that attempts to minimize the latencies in RTOS,minimizing cache misses for GPOS processes as well. Nesting PTP in CAP (PIC) is the proposal of this paper. To quantitatively depict the latency differences the Cyclictest has been used,which is a program that notifies the minimum,average and maximum latencies by a process. Improving the RTOS response without affecting the GPOS by proper sharing of Last Level Cache is the aim. © 2016,International Journal of Pharmacy and Technology. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In this paper,the lossless image is achieved by using the lossless compression technique. In lossless compression technique a decompressed image would give back the original image without the loss of any information or data. Monochromatic 2D images are 2D images in gray scale or black and white. JPEG2000 is the coding technique developed by (Joint Photographic Expert Group) in 2000 having developed scalability and edit ability feature than JPEG. In JPEG2000 Discrete Wavelet Transform is used. In Discrete Wavelet Transform,wavelet compression converts image into a series of wavelets that can be stored more efficiently than blocks. There exist various compression techniques. In this paper,we are going to use Run-Length encoding and Huffman code for lossless image compression. Run-Length encoding is a simple technique in which same data values in a sequence occurs in the same data elements. In Huffman code lossless technique shorter code are assigned to the most frequently used symbols and longer codes to the symbols which appear less frequently. This methodology can be used in image sharing applications like hike,WhatsApp,mails,etc. where a particular image is compressed and depressed to achieve the original image. © 2016,International Journal of Pharmacy and Technology.

abstract={The steganographic technique is the craft of concealing facts. This can be made by concealing one data in another. All digital files for example image,audio,video and text can be utilized for concealing the mystery information. In video steganography,video file acts as a carrier and secret information can be hidden into the video file. All other existing video Steganographic methods are used to embed secret information into video frames. In this proposed system,video Steganography used to conceal the secret message into a video file. Here,the secret message is a text file and the cover media is a video file. Both cryptography and steganography are used to provide better security. We consider the video and embedded text file as a binary file. Secret Message is encrypted using AES algorithm. Then,cipher message is converted into binary file which is then rearranged using pattern. The resultant text is embedded into the video file. If the secret information is encoded and hidden in the video file,it provides an extra layer of security and diminishes the chance to get hidden information. This project expects to provide an efficient and secure technique for video steganography. In this new method,we use the pattern to rearrange the cipher bits. The location of the cipher bits are identified only by the key sequence of the pattern. © 2016,International Journal of Pharmacy and Technology. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Side-Channel Analysis explores the information leaked through the various loss can be used to get secret key that is used for cryptographic operations. Lightweight key updation is used by cryptographers to protect the standards. There are stateless and stateful key updation methods. In stateless key updation,the master key is combined,encrypted as pseudorandom state. The output sent as the input to stateful key updation,session key and running key are generated during stateful key updation. The key-schedule algorithm utilizes the session key. The first and last round keys of each encryption are replaced by the running keys. This paper implements the lightweight key updation between the stateless and stateful key updation by MD5 algorithm. MD5 (message digest) is hashing algorithm producing 128-bit hash that is used in cryptography. In the existing system,stateless and stateful key updation is used. During these key updation there is a chance of side-channel attack by the outsiders. In order to provide more security to the sidechannel attack this paper implemented the MD5. It is hashing algorithm that is implemented to provide more security to the key generation than the stateless and stateful key updation. © 2016,International Journal of Pharmacy and Technology.

abstract={Cloud computing provides enormous amount of storage space for the users. Terabytes of data is stored across the world in the various cloud servers. Resource intensive mobile devices store the data through the Storage as a Service in the remote cloud. Cloud is not trusted for security and integrity of the mobile user’s data. So the data is stored in encrypted form to provide confidentiality. Without downloading the contents of the file the integrity has to be checked by the resource intensive mobile devices. To ensure the correctness of the data in the remote cloud server a Remote Checking Protocol is needed. A novel framework is proposed to check the integrity of a data file with optimal computation and minimum storage cost in the mobile device. Mobile client possess only the Meta tag for verification and deletes the file in its local storage. This protocol verifies the data stored in the remote cloud server infinite times and supports the data modification in the cloud server dynamically. A naive approach is proposed to verify the data storage correctness using Galois field GF (pn) computations. © 2016,International Journal of Pharmacy and Technology. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Multi-sensor data fusion is an emerging technology in which data from various sensor inputs are fused in order to produce more reliable,accurate and complete detail description of the environment. However the present-day sensor network experience some uncertainty,inaccuracy and conflict. Especially the current models are not fully suited for the contextbased cognitive functions. The problem was addressed in detail in the circumstance of belief theory in order to deal with uncertainty and different forms of conflict information. Among several fusion techniques Dempster Shafer Theory (DST) is considered as most predominant method for signifying and processing the uncertainty. But DST is not capable of differentiating the improper information. In order to overcome the weakness information to be fused the Weibull Distribution is used to give reliable information that is given as input to DST. The proposed WD-DST used to find the defective information and also to perform data fusion in evidential networks.

abstract={Secure Communication of data is a major concern in today’s growing world. Cryptography is the mathematical technique of hiding information for ensuring authentication,confidentiality and other aspects of information security. The growing aspect of data transmission needs an exceptional means of security over the network. Cryptanalysis attack has to be difficult for the third party access. These emphasize the demand for light weight concept in encryption. An Authenticated Lightweight Encryption (ALE) is an individual-path nonce-based encryption algorithm which uses associated data. It implements the combination of both AES-128 bit key schedule and their round transformation. ALE provides better security and high performance than other encryption techniques but it leads to Slide attack which occurs when the periodic process illustrates self-similarity and independent of the iterated round function. It is prevented by avoiding the self-similarity of a periodic process by adding iteration counters and random constants which is fixed. It employs all symmetric cryptographic functions,from hashing to authenticated encryption and random number generation. Thus a cryptographic process based on AES technique,implemented with lightweight algorithm and lightweight hash function is proposed for better security. © 2016,International Journal of Pharmacy and Technology.

abstract={Scheduling distributed applications can be challenging in a multi-cloud environment due to the lack of knowledge about the application characteristics. In order to realize a versatile multi-cloud scheduling algorithm,knowledge about the application’s runtime behavior over various resources is needed. Besides,not all applications exhibit the same kind of resource consumption pattern at all stages. Thus,looking into the resource consumption pattern,extracting the knowledge and classifying the applications can help in better decision making in a multi-cloud environment. The aim of this project is to create a profiler component that monitors the resource consumption of applications and stores it in a profile database. This profiler monitors the whole workflow,so that any user constructed workflow’s execution can be estimated by the use of certain Machine Learning algorithms using which an Analytical Model can be created and the estimation is carried out using the profiled data. Using the profile database,the execution time of an workflow can be estimated based on the resource consumption data of the workflow. In this project,we profile certain scientific applications and monitor their resource consumption pattern on different hardware configurations. After profiling,the applications are classified as being memory-intensive,cpu-intensive etc and using the resource consumption pattern of the application,execution characteristics of a particular workflow can be predicted. This is done with the help of certain machine learning algorithms like k-NN classifier,k-NN regression and SIGAR API is used for extracting resource consumption data. © 2016,International Journal of Pharmacy and Technology.

abstract={The quick pace of technological changes, market and industry changes, demographic composition change and society changes requires that human resource managers should revitalize their proficiencies to go with these new challenges. The manager who is a liaison in the organizational hierarchy does a very important job in the organization to direct and channel the employee cluster towards its organization goal, and ensure that each member of the team should be dynamic and prolific. The study on supervisory competency analysis is a crucial and fundamental requirement for any organization. The current study ‘The leveraging effect of Supervisory competencies towards the performance in Indian manufacturing group’ is based on primary data collected from one hundred and fifty employees working in a paper manufacturing industry. The data collected were analysed using SPSS and SMART PLS software. The results of the study revealed that the impact of supervisory competencies towards his performance is huge which accounts to 81% (R2 = 0.810) and towards the growth of whole organization is 35% (R2 = 0.356). This implies that if the supervisory level employees are competent enough by possessing certain competencies, his individual performance will do extreme wonders and will create a strong bond between him and the organization and also create an impact on organization growth by clear strategy formulation, creating committed workforce, developing the organization as learning organization and stimulating individual and group productivity. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Composite materials are multifunctional in nature, which can be custom-made based on the nature of the applications. The challenge of composite materials lie on complementing the properties of one another i.e. materials which go in the making of composites strengthen each other by inhibiting their weaknesses. Polymers are one of the widely used materials which serve a wide spectrum of engineering needs. In the present work, the tribological behaviour of a composite containing Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) and traces of Alumina is experimentally investigated. Alumina is added to ABS in various percentages such as 1%, and 3% by weight in order to improve the wear resistance of the polymer. Central Composite Design was used to design the experiments and a standard Pin-On-Disk apparatus was used to conduct the experiments. It is observed from the test results that the addition of alumina significantly enhances the wear behavior of the polymer. However, adding more percentage of alumina has led to adverse effect on wear resistance of polymer materials. Abrasive wear mechanism is found to be predominant in the case of alumina added composite materials. It is also found that 1% alumina added composite exhibits excellent wear properties compared to other materials. © 2016 Published by Faculty of Engineering.},

The proposed method utilizes less computation and uses only the speech rate timing information of the uttered word and the energy associated with the word is taken as the features for decision making. The uttered word beginning and the end is identified by using the interrupt associated with the key which is used for the recording of the uttered word.

abstract={The present paper applies the tenets of Ecofeminism to the study of Mahasweta Devi's short story 'Witch'. Ecofeminism is a movement that sees a connection between the exploitation and degradation of the natural world and the subordination and oppression of women. Degradation of the environment and women tops the list of problems the world faces today. Ecofeminism functions as a tool that draws the attention of the world to crucial environmental issues and to the subjugation of women through the analysis of literature. The study substantiates Mahasweta Devi's basic idea of the exploitation of the tribal women as an extension of the spoliation of land. The reaction to such indiscrimination and domination is represented on the story through the picture of starvation and exploitation with a female character as the center of attraction. The most important is that a voiceless tribal woman, Somri is turned to a 'daini' which means a witch. The so called upper class not only exploits her body but also very cunningly exploits the land and superstition of the villagers.},

abstract={Background: Aberrant signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT-3) molecular signaling elicit hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in humans. Therefore, targeting STAT-3 is considered as an attractive option towards suppression of HCC in humans. Objective: Our objective is to identify a potential small molecule inhibitor that can specifically target STAT-3 and suppress HCC. Methods: In this study, we analyze a group of sesquiterpene lactone (STL) candidates that has been recently reported in preclinical trials against cancer by a unified computational and experimental approach. Results: Our virtual analysis of the STL candidates revealed Artesunate (ATS) as the best potential inhibitor of STAT-3 with comparable potency to specific inhibitor S3I-201. We also observed that ATS inhibited IL-6 driven STAT-3-DNA binding activity with comparable potency to S3I-201 in a cell free system. Furthermore ATS was observed to interfere with STAT-3 dimerization and suppression of both constitutive and IL-6 inducible STAT-3 in vitro. Nevertheless, we also observed that ATS modulated STAT-3 dependent targets (procaspase-3, Bcl-xl and survivin) favoring occurrence of apoptosis in vitro. Overall, the putative inhibition of STAT-3 by ATS suggested its capacity to interfere with STAT-3 dimerization by binding to the SH2 domain of STAT-3 monomer. It resulted in suppression of STAT-3 and also favored promotion of in vitro cells towards apoptosis. Consequently, ATS also exhibited selective cytotoxicity of cancer cells over normal cells in vitro. Conclusion: All the above observations substantiated by unified computational and in vitro experimental approaches suggested its potential role as a therapeutic anti-cancer agent against HCC. © 2016 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={Herein, we report a laboratory convenient method for the preparation of blue color emitting fluorescent carbon dots (C-dots) in 60 min by boiling the alkaline solution of pectin. The C-dots derived from pectin detects selectively silver ion by forming silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) without any irradiation or heating or additional reducing agents. As prepared AgNPs appears yellow in color and showed the characteristic surface plasmon resonance maximum at 410 nm. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed crystalline, spherical AgNPs with size range from 10-15 nm. Cyclic voltammetry study revealed that the lower reduction potential of C-dots than that of silver ion favors the reduction of Ag + to Ag°. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy showed the charge transfer value for the redox reaction of C-dots as 200 Ωcm 2 . In the presence of Ag + , C-dots fluorescence emission was turned from blue to cyan to green to colorless, accompanying the quenching and red shift in emission maximum at 450 nm. Interference study clearly showed that the C-dots have high preference for Ag + ion than the other interfering metal ions. The proposed sensor system selectively senses Ag + ion in water at micromolar concentration and also offers an easy procedure to prepare AgNPs in the presence of other interfering metal ions. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={The set covering problem (SCP) is a well known classic combinatorial NP-hard problem, having practical application in many fields. To optimize the objective function of the SCP, many heuristic, meta heuristic, greedy and approximation approaches have been proposed in the recent years. In the development of swarm intelligence, the particle swarm optimization is a nature inspired optimization technique for continuous problems and for discrete problems we have the well known discrete particle swarm optimization (DPSO) method. Aiming towards the best solution for discrete problems, we have the recent method called jumping particle swarm optimization (JPSO). In this DPSO the improved solution is based on the particles attraction caused by attractor. In this paper, a new approach based on JPSO is proposed to solve the SCP. The proposed approach works in three phases: for selecting attractor, refining the feasible solution given by the attractor in order to reach the optimality and for removing redundancy in the solution. The proposed approach has been tested on the benchmark instances of SCP and compared with best known methods. Computational results show that it produces high quality solution in very short running times when compared to other algorithms. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={Cybercriminals arise in the web and perpetrate numerous fraudulent activities with the help of Rogue Antivirus. Rogue Antivirus (RA) infects computers and causes users to purchase fake software whose cost is hundreds or thousands of dollars. As a result, RA conducts criminal activities whenever the user is connected to the Internet. Even if the user is offline, Rogue Antivirus tries to gather the personal information of the end-users and hamper the systems. There are various removal guidelines proposed recently, such that Rogue Antivirus can be controlled to some extent. But it intrudes in web applications and degrades the performance of the system. Rogue Antivirus software, in reality, assists the attackers by means of installing malicious codes while it claims the protection of commercial applications. Today, Rogue Antivirus comes in many forms like Scareware, Malware, Botnets, etc. which affect Internet users and other web applications critically. The occurrence and success of these threats make it very difficult for security experts to protect the system from RA. Hence, a detailed survey and research must be carried out on the implications of Rogue Antivirus and its impact on the security world. In this paper, an extensive literature survey on Rogue Antivirus and its impact on corrupting the end-user system are presented. But the scope of implementation to protect from Rogue Antivirus is limited due to the nonavailability of a wide research focus on the topic. © 2016 McFarland & Company, Inc.},

abstract={The present investigation deals with performance analysis of single server preemptive priority retrial queue with immediate Bernoulli feedback. There are two types of customers are considered, which are priority customers and ordinary customers. The priority customers do not form any queue and have an exclusive preemptive priority to receive their services over ordinary customers. After completion of regular service for ordinary customer, the customer is allowed to make an immediate feedback with probability r. When the orbit becomes empty at service completion instant for a priority customer or ordinary customer; the server goes for multiple working vacations. By using the supplementary variable technique, we obtained the steady state probability generating functions for the system/orbit. Some important system performance measures, the mean busy period and the mean busy cycle are discussed. Finally, some numerical examples are presented. © 2016, Prince of Songkla University.

abstract={ContextSyzygium densiflorum Wall. ex Wight & Arn (Myrtaceae) has been traditionally used by local tribes of the Nilgiris, Tamil Nadu, India, for the treatment of diabetes, however, no definitive experimental studies are available. Objective This study investigates the antidiabetic, antihyperlipidaemic and antioxidant activities of ethanol extract of S. densiflorum (EFSD) fruits in streptozotocin (STZ) and nicotinamide (NA)-induced diabetic rats. Materials and methods Acute oral toxicity and oral glucose tolerance were assessed in normal rats. The antidiabetic, antihyperlipidaemic and antioxidant activities were investigated in STZ − NA-induced diabetic rats. Diabetic rats were orally administered with glibenclamide (10 mg/kg b.wt), EFSD (200, 400 and 800 mg/kg b.wt) for 28 d. Further, changes in the blood glucose level (BGL), biochemical parameters, antioxidants were observed and histology of pancreas was performed. Results No toxicity and lethality were observed. Results of the following parameters are represented by treated versus disease control (STZ + NA) groups. BGL (161.33 ± 22.8 versus 476.17 ± 56.58 mg/dl), glycosylated haemoglobin (5.285 ± 0.19 versus 8.05 ± 0.55%), urea (40.32 ± 1.96 versus 75.37 ± 2.91 mg/dl), uric acid (1.2 ± 0.07 versus 2.16 ± 0.05 mg/dl), total cholesterol (89.3 ± 5.14 versus 139.7 ± 5.95 mg/dl) and triglycerides (79.65 ± 2.52 versus 108.9 ± 3.61 mg/dl) were significantly decreased, whereas haemoglobin (11.75 ± 0.73 versus 7.95 ± 0.42 g/dl), high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (14.2 ± 1.11 versus 6.97 ± 0.84 mg/dl), total protein (45%) and liver glycogen (87%) were significantly increased in EFSD-treated diabetic group. Significant changes were observed in the enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants in EFSD-treated groups (p < 0.001). Histopathological examination showed the regeneration of β-cells in Islets of Langerhans.

abstract={Nano-delivery systems have significantly evolved over the last decade for the treatment of cancer by enabling site-specific delivery and improved bioavailability. The widely investigated nanoparticle systems are biodegradable polyesters, dendrimers, liposomes, mesoporous silica and gold nanoparticles. These particles when conjugated with different targeting motifs enhance the therapeutic efficiency of the drug molecules and biocompatibility. However, the application of such systems towards the treatment of retinoblastoma (RB), a rapidly spreading childhood eye cancer, still remains in its infancy. Nanoparticle-based systems that have been investigated for RB therapy have displayed improved drug delivery to the most restricted posterior segment of the eyes and have increased intra-vitreal half-life of the chemotherapy agents highlighting its potential in treatment of this form of cancer. This review focuses on the challenges involved in the treatment of RB and highlights the attempts made to develop nano-dimensional systems for the treatment of RB. © 2015 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.},

abstract={Severe forms of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) adversely affect the liver physiology and hence the pharmacokinetics of drugs. Here, we investigated the effect of NAFLD on the pharmacokinetics of rosiglitazone, an insulin sensitizer used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Male C57BL/6 mice were divided into two groups. The first group (n=14) was fed with normal chow feed and the second group (n=14) was fed with 60% high-fat diet (HFD) and 40% high fructose liquid (HFL) for 60 days to induce NAFLD. The development of NAFLD was confirmed by histopathology, liver triglyceride levels and biochemical estimations, and used for pharmacokinetic investigations. Rosiglitazone was administered orally at 30 mg/kg dose. At predetermined time points, blood was collected and rosiglitazone concentrations were determined using LC/MS/MS. Plasma concentrations were subjected to non-compartmental analysis using Phoenix WinNonlin (6.3), and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) was calculated by the linear-up log-down method. HFD and HFL diet successfully induced NAFLD in mice. Rosiglitazone pharmacokinetics in NAFLD animals were altered significantly as compared to healthy mice. Rosiglitazone exposure increased significantly in NAFLD mice (2.5-fold higher AUC than healthy mice). The rosiglitazone oral clearance was significantly lower and the mean plasma half-life was significantly longer in NAFLD mice as compared to healthy mice. The NAFLD mouse model showed profound effects on rosiglitazone pharmacokinetics. The magnitude of change in rosiglitazone pharmacokinetics is similar to that observed in humans with moderate to severe liver disease. The present animal model can be utilized to study the NAFLD-induced changes in the pharmacokinetics of different drugs. © 2016 2016 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.},

abstract={Primary cilia play a key role in sensory perception and various signaling pathways. Any defect in them leads to group of disorders called ciliopathies, and Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS, OMIM 209900) is one among them. The disorder is clinically and genetically heterogeneous, with various primary and secondary clinical manifestations, and shows autosomal recessive inheritance and highly prevalent in inbred/consanguineous populations. The disease mapped to at least twenty different genes (BBS1-BBS20), follow oligogenic inheritance pattern. BBS proteins localizes to the centerosome and regulates the biogenesis and functions of the cilia. In BBS, the functioning of various systemic organs (with ciliated cells) gets deranged and results in systemic manifestations. Certain components of the disease (such as obesity, diabetes, and renal problems) when noticed earlier offer a disease management benefit to the patients. However, the awareness of the disease is comparatively low and most often noticed only after severe vision loss in patients, which is usually in the first decade of the patient's age. In the current review, we have provided the recent updates retrieved from various types of scientific literature through journals, on the genetics, its molecular relevance, and the clinical outcome in BBS. The review in nutshell would provide the basic awareness of the disease that will have an impact in disease management and counseling benefits to the patients and their families. © 2016 Indian Journal of Ophthalmology.},

We check whether the nonreciprocal nature is common to all PT-symmetric systems and, if not, what are the situations under which it can be observed. Due to the recent interest in studying spontaneous symmetry breaking in coupled waveguide systems, we here present such symmetry-breaking bifurcations in certain reciprocal and nonreciprocal PT-symmetric systems. © 2016 American Physical Society.},

abstract={The transport and CO adsorption properties on rutile TiO2 molecular device is studied using DFT method. The transport characteristics of TiO2 nanostructure are described in terms of electron density, density of states and transmission spectrum. The applied bias voltage in TiO2 device increases the peak maxima in the valence band as well as in the conduction band. The electron density in TiO2 nanostructure is found to be more along oxygen sites than in titanium sites. The transmission spectrum of TiO2 molecular device provides clear insights on transmission of electrons at various energy intervals. The adsorption properties of CO on TiO2 molecular device is studied in terms of voltage and resistance characteristics along the scattering region.

abstract={In this work, a new yellow-emitting Ca2SiO4 based Eu2+ ion doped phosphor has been successfully developed using a propylene glycol modified silane (PGMS) as silicate source. The phosphor material obtained is subjected to detailed structural and luminescent studies. The results obtained show that the XRD patterns of Eu2+ doped Ca2SiO4 phosphors are in good agreement with the Ca2SiO4 (ICSD No: 79533) whose structure is monoclinic. The output of the luminescence studies clearly portrays a broad yellow emission between 450 and 800 nm with a peak at ~630 nm under the broad excitation range. This confirms its efficient emission towards the development of a warm white light using blue and near ultraviolet (NUV) LEDs. Meanwhile, the same phosphor synthesized using conventional silicate source via solid state reaction technique showed no shift in the emission wavelength. But, the PGMS supported synthesis of Ca2SiO4:Eu2+ phosphor emitted in a broad spectral range with an efficient red shift in the peaking wavelength. These results are showing off the possibilities to produce warm white light using single phosphor with blue or NUV LEDs. Hence, it is capable to replace the conventional YAG:Ce3+ phosphors which give white light with low color-rendering index due to the lack of emission in the red spectral region. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.},

abstract={Cryptography is a technique by which the stored and transferred data in a particular form can be comprehended and processed by only those, who it is intended for. In the modern era, cryptography is most often associated with the deception of the plaintext into a cipher text using a process called Encryption then back to the original plaintext using a process called Decryption. Strong cryptography refers to those cryptographic systems or components that provide considerable immunity to cryptanalysis. The potency of any cryptographic algorithm is solely dependent on the strength of the key used. This paper aims at improving the strength of the key by making use of modified Huffman Code which is a special kind of prefix code which is optimal in nature and is prevalently used for lossless data compression. The outcome of Huffman code is a code of variable length which can be effectively used encoding a source character. The aforementioned concept makes use of the Blowfish algorithm for encryption and is implemented using Java. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Renewable Energy Sources (RES) plays a vital role today, owing to its excess availability and they are gaining importance because of the merits like pollution free, eco friendly, no maintenance, sustainability etc. Solar rays consist of photons, which are considered to be stream of energetic light particles. The solar cell or Photovoltaic cell (PV) converts photons present in solar rays to current. Intensity of sunlight striking the surface, efficiency and size of PV are the factors responsible for current generation from PV cell. However, change in irradiance, temperature or shadow effect will affect the overall PV performance. This will lead to decrease in output power from the solar cell. While modeling the PV in MATLAB, single diode model is given more importance over double diode model, because of the advantages like moderate complexity and acceptable accuracy. The PV is modeled in MATLAB considering the design equations of photon current and reverse saturation current. The design of power electronic converter is very important. To ensure reliability, safety, and to provide maximum efficiency to the PV system, selection and design of power electronic converters should be correct as well as optimal. The power converter is interfaced between PV panel and load. The Reference voltage is fixed based on the open circuit voltage available at the output of the converter. The benefits of zeta converter over other converters include non pulsating output current, lower settling time, adaptability, etc. In order to satisfy load voltage ripple requirement, and because of the non pulsating output current, zeta converter permits the use of small output capacitor. The objective of this paper is to maintain the constant output voltage, irrespective of change in irradiance. Change in irradiance, causes the change of output voltage from PV panel, which causes the duty cycle (D) to vary and duty cycle depends on both output voltage from PV module and reference voltage. Change in duty cycle makes the zeta converter to operate either in buck or boost mode. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={In recent years, many successful machine learning applications have been developed. Classification & Clustering is one such. This application is cross-disciplinary, now that it is based on data mining algorithms on the technical side and on graphemes and morphophonemic on the linguistic side. It will thus map the correspondence between grapheme <y> and related phonemes via morphemes in a given context. The grapheme <y> is often realized as an approximant /j/ (a consonant phoneme), as in <yacht> or as vowel / i / as in <racy>, or a diphthong / ai / as in <sky>, etc. The objective, that is to say, of this text analysis is to map the various articulators//phonemic realizations of the grapheme <y>. This experiment will thus help the study the occurrence of <y> in different positions in words, word initially, finally or elsewhere, as in these examples. The training data (or corpus) chosen for this experimentation is a set of English literary texts [Harry Potter part 1, part 2, The complete works of William Shakespeare By William Shakespeare, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes By Arthur Conan Doyle, (A Christmas carol) By Charles Dickens's. As for the tools, the alphabet recognizer is used for retrieving information and categorizing the data as noun, adjective, etc. Then, GATE Developer, the Text engineering tool is used to analyze the dataset and to derive the output with statistical data of global distribution <y> as in all the input documents. This project is particularly relevant because it offers, as will be demonstrated, a solution to problems due to lack of one-to-one correspondence between spelling and pronunciation in English, as for instance, in the context of language pedagogy.

abstract={The Image enciphering applications have been progressively analyzed to cope with the demand of secured realtime image transmission over the channels. The existing chaotic systems hold several important features, such as the sore dependence on initial constraints, system arguments, pseudorandom property, no periodicity and topological transitivity. Chaotic cryptosystems have more useful and practical applications. To advance the proficiency of the ciphering scheme the projected work presents an enciphering scheme for digital color images, which follows pixel value reordering fashion using Adaptive key based block selection algorithm. Multiple pixels reordering patterns have been generated and are applied to a single image by partitioning the image into blocks. The Key (Secret) is used to decide the enciphering pattern on the partitioned image block and it results a final encrypted image. The image can reform in to the parental form with the help of same key and pattern to apply the pixel value reordering scheme to its associated blocks of the image. The main advantage of such a proposed technique is its lossless decomposition, efficiency and simplicity. The experimental outcome shows the efficiency of the proposed technique, which resist the usual existing cipher attacks. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme proves that it is suitable for image applications. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={We theoretically demonstrate a bandwidth tunable broadband light spectrum in IR region, using a CS2 core photonic crystal fiber (CSPCF) by varying its temperature. The broadband spectrum is generated via modulation instability (MI) induced supercontinuum (SC) generation process by considering the thermooptic coefficient of CS2 liquid. The temperature-dependent fiber parameters are utilized to solve the nonlinear Schrödinger equation, which is modified with the effect of saturable nonlinearity of CS2. By using numerical simulation, generation of new photons through the process of MI and subsequent evolution of SC spectrum are analyzed under the influence of temperature. The generated SC spectrum shows a variation of a several hundred nanometers in its bandwidth with a change of mere 20 °C in the temperature of CSPCF. It is found that the bandwidth of SC spectrum can be tuned from 688 nm to 1022 nm by varying temperature, saturable parameter, and pump power. The proposed tunable SC spectrum finds application in IR spectroscopy, optical coherence tomography, etc. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={21st century has almost become "Green century" with an increased demand for plant products (bioenergy-oil). Hence, to develop a natural biodiesel feedstock, common species of Jatropha in and around Thanjavur is selected based on its enriched monoalkyl ester content which could be a good source for generating biofuels. Tanjorensis seed oil were extracted and analyzed for its physico-chemical properties such as % free fatty acid, acid value iodine, peroxide, saponification values. P. aeruginosa crude lipase treated transesterification followed by GC-MS analysis of oil proved that oleic acid (37.3 %) and linoleic acid (33.3 %) were the principal fatty acids while palmitic acid and stearic acid being the major saturated fatty acids. Oil contents of Tanjorensis seed oil were comparable with the oil extracted from other species of Jatropha and were found to be close to oil from Jatropha curcas. Tanjorensis seed oil extracts could be useful in industrial applications and as a biodiesel feedstock. © 2016, Chemical Publishing Co. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were synthesized from aqueous extract of Clerodendrum phlomidis L. leaves and characterized by UV-visible spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis. Preliminary UV-visible spectroscopic studies confirmed the presence of biosynthesized AgNPs. Microscopic studies revealed the structure of highly aggregated smaller AgNPs in the diameter range of 23-42 nm. EqqqqqqqqDAX analysis confirmed the presence of elemental silver. FT-IR studies showed prominent peaks at 3367 cm- 1, corresponding to OH and NH stretchings. Strong organic IR bands support the functionalization of organic molecules from C. phlomidis extract on AgNPs surface. Results also showed that biosynthesised AgNPs exhibit remarkable antioxidant activity than the crude extract using phosphomolybdate assay, ferric reducing power, superoxide radical scavenging activity and DPPH assay. Biofunctionalised AgNPs possesses significant anticancer effect on Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) and human colorectal adenocarcinoma (HT29) cells with 91.84% and 84.91% inhibition, respectively using MTT assay, which provides promising approach for alternative nano-drug development. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={The major loss of tissue extracellular matrix (ECM) after myocardial ischemia is a serious burden that gradually leads to heart failure. Due to lack of available treatment methods to restore the cardiac function, various research strategies have come up to treat the ischemic myocardium. However these have met with limited success due to the complexity of the cardiac tissue, which exhibits a nanofibrous collagenous matrix with spatio-temporal localization of a combination of growth factors. To mimic the topographical and chemical cues of the natural cardiac tissue, we have fabricated a growth factor embedded nanofibrous scaffold through electrospinning. In our previous work, we have reported a nanofibrous matrix made of PLCL and PEOz with an average diameter of 500 nm. The scaffold properties were specifically characterized in vitro for cardio-compatibility. In the present study, we have loaded dual growth factors VEGF and bFGF in the nanofiber matrix and investigated its suitability for cardiac tissue engineering. The encapsulation and release of dual growth factors from the matrix were studied using XPS and ELISA. Bioactivity of the loaded growth factors towards proliferation and migration of endothelial cells (HUVECs) was evaluated through MTS and Boyden chamber assays respectively. The efficiency of growth factors on the nanofibrous matrix to activate signaling molecules was studied in HUVECs through gene expression analysis. Preclinical evaluation of the growth factor embedded nanofibrous patch in a rabbit acute myocardial infarction (AMI) model was studied and cardiac function assessment was made through ECG and echocardiography. The evidence for angiogenesis in the patch secured regions was analyzed through histopathology and immunohistochemistry. Our results confirm the effectiveness of growth factor embedded nanofiber matrix in restoration of cardiac function after ischemia when compared to conventional patch material thereby exhibiting promise as a valuable therapeutic solution to treat ischemic disorders. © 2016.},

abstract={Activation of the IL-6 mediated JAK-STAT (Janus associated kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription) oncogenic signalling plays a major role in hepatocellular carcinoma pathogenesis. The aim of this study is to assess the anti-tumour, anti-proliferative and apoptotic potential of artesunate and its capacity to modulate JAK-STAT pathway in a nitrosodiethylamine mediated experimental hepatocellular carcinoma model. Administration of nitrosodiethylamine (200 mg/kg body weight by i.p. Injections) to rats resulted in alterations of liver pathophysiological parameters such as increased relative liver weight, and increased tumour nodule occurrence. It also increased the levels of serum marker enzymes (AST, ALT, ALP, LDH, and γGT) and tumour biomarker (AFP) levels suggestive of its capacity to cause liver tumourigenesis. Additionally, the immunohistochemistry of liver sections pertaining to nitrosodiethylamine administered animals showed increased detection of AgNOR, PCNA, and GST-Pi positive cells suggestive of its capacity to promote liver proliferation associated tumourigenesis. On the contrary, artesunate (25 mg/kg bodyweight) supplementation to nitrosodiethylamine administered animals decreased all the above mentioned pathophysiological, biochemical, and immunohistochemistry parameters suggesting its anti-tumour and anti-proliferative potential. Furthermore, immunoblot analysis showed significant up-regulation of IL-6, GP130, JAK-2, STAT-3 (pY705), Bcl-xL, Bcl-2 and simultaneous down-regulation of Caspase-3, PARP and SOCS-3 in nitrosodiethylamine administered animals. Nevertheless, the immunoblot analysis revealed vice-versa on artesunate supplementation to nitrosodiethylamine administered animals, indicating promotion of the feedback loop inhibition mechanism through SOCS3 up-regulation thereby leading to suppression of JAK-STAT signalling. Overall all these findings substantiate that artesunate promotes anti-tumour, anti-proliferation and apoptosis against nitrosodiethylamine mediated hepatocellular carcinoma. © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

abstract={Ice core drillings have been performed in various zones in Antarctica and Greenland to obtain climatological information, study ice properties, or analyze air and dust encapsulated in the ice during the quaternary period. During these procedures, a set of measurements to characterize the ice and to evaluate its physical and chemical properties are usually performed in situ. In particular, using known temperature and dielectric profiles (DEP measurements), it is possible to evaluate the ice electromagnetic power absorption profile, valid at the drilling site. In the last decades, bedrock characterization through radio echo sounding surveys has been improved by the analysis of the power of radar echoes. This way, analysis of the electromagnetic properties of bedrock interfaces makes it possible to assess the physical characteristics and to distinguish between wet and dry conditions. Power variation of the received echoes also depends on ice absorption and on bedrock reflectivity due to specific physical conditions of the ice. In this paper, the propagation of electromagnetic waves through the ice sheet is examined, and in particular, a new method for establishing the electromagnetic absorption profile for ice from core drilling measurements is proposed and discussed. Variation in the ice absorption is deduced, starting from the analysis of ice core data from the European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica (EPICA) at the Concordia station (Antarctica) and from the Greenland Ice Core Project (GRIP) site (Greenland). This direct method of measurement is proposed with the aim of defining common characteristics of the ice absorption rate that are valid both in Antarctica and in Greenland. © 2016 IEEE.},

Finding the chromatic number is an NP-hard and combinatorial optimization problem. The divide & conquer strategy is implemented by partitioning the vertex set V(G) into some subsets and the subsets are solved heuristically.

abstract={We investigate the emergence of different kinds of imperfectly synchronized states and chimera states in two interacting populations of nonlocally coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators. We find that the complete synchronization in population I and existence of solitary oscillators which escape from the synchronized group in population II lead to imperfectly synchronized states for sufficiently small values of nonisochronicity parameter. Interestingly, upon increasing the strength of this parameter further there occurs an onset of mixed imperfectly synchronized states where the solitary oscillators occur from both the populations. Synchronized oscillators from both the populations are locked to a common average frequency. In both cases of imperfectly synchronized states, synchronized oscillators exhibit periodic motion while the solitary oscillators are quasiperiodic in nature. In this region, for spatially prepared initial conditions, we can observe the mixed chimera states where the coexistence of synchronized and desynchronized oscillations occur from both the populations. On the other hand, imperfectly synchronized states are not always stable, and they can drift aperiodically due to instability caused by an increase of nonisochronicity parameter. We observe that these states are robust to the introduction of frequency mismatch between the two populations. © 2016 American Physical Society.},

The performance of such controller is compared with PID, Fuzzy Tuned PID, Sliding Mode and Error Compensation controllersin terms of transient and steady state responses along with load and line disturbances. In this paper systematic procedures are used for developing all the above controllers which make the system robust against load and line disturbances. The hardware results validate the simulated response and forcing out the merits over the other existing control methods.

abstract={Nanofluids are promising heat transfer fluids for a wide range of energy management applications. Probe ultrasonication-mediated preparation of copper - propylene glycol nanofluid is accomplished through dispersion of biosurfactant-functionalized copper nanoparticles in propylene glycol. Copper - propylene glycol nanofluids are colloidally stable; retain their thermal conductivity enhancement despite repeated heating-cooling cycles and storage for more than 15 days. These nanofluids exhibit temperature-independent thermal conductivity enhancement, with about ~11% enhancement for 1 vol % nanofluid, attributable to Brownian motion and interfacial layering. The viscosity of nanofluids is lower than that of base fluid (propylene glycol) due to interactions between biosurfactant and propylene glycol. Our data clearly demonstrate that the use of 1 vol % copper - propylene glycol nanofluid as coolant can lead to 13.2% improvement in the rate of energy recovery from a constant-temperature hot bath when the heat transfer resistance in the hot fluid side is low. The results of the present study have implications for energy management in solar thermal systems. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Augmented Reality (AR) plays a vital role in the field of visual computing. AR is actually different but often confused to be the same is Virtual Reality (VR). While VR creates a whole new world, AR aims at designing an environment in real time with virtual components that are overlaid on the real components. Due to this reason, AR comes under the category of 'mixed reality'. AR could be viewed on any smart electronic gadgets like mobile, laptop, projector, tablet etc., AR could be broadly classified as Marker-based and Markerless. If it is marker-based, a pattern is used whereas in markerless system there is no need of it. In case of marker, if we show the pattern to a webcam it will get details about it and impose the object on the marker. We are incorporating a new efficient solution for integrating a virtual object on to a real world which can be very much handful for tourism and advertisement for showcasing objects or things. The ultimate goal is to augmenting the 3D video onto a real world on which it will increase the person's conceptual understanding of the subject. © 2017, IGI Global.},

abstract={We report the emergence of a collective dynamical state, namely, the phase-flip chimera, from an ensemble of identical nonlinear oscillators that are coupled indirectly via the dynamical variables from a common environment, which in turn are nonlocally coupled. The phase-flip chimera is characterized by the coexistence of two adjacent out-of-phase synchronized coherent domains interspersed by an incoherent domain, in which the nearby oscillators are in out-of-phase synchronized states. Attractors of the coherent domains are either from the same or from different basins of attractions, depending on whether they are periodic or chaotic. The conventional chimera precedes the phase-flip chimera in general. Further, the phase-flip chimera emerges after the completely synchronized evolution of the ensemble, in contrast to conventional chimeras, which emerge as an intermediate state between completely incoherent and coherent states. We have also characterized the observed dynamical transitions using the strength of incoherence, probability distribution of the correlation coefficient, and framework of the master stability function. © 2016 American Physical Society.},

abstract={Cloud computing tends to provide high quality on-demand services to the users. Numerous services are evolving today. Functionally similar services are having different non-functional properties such as reliability, availability, accessibility, response time and cost. A single service is inadequate for constructing the business process. Such business process is modeled as composite service. Composite service consists of several atomic services connected by workflow patterns. Selecting services for service composition with the constraints specified in Service Level Agreement is the NP-hard problem. Such a cloud service composition problem is modeled in this paper. Genetic based cloud service composition algorithm (GCSC) is proposed. Proposed algorithm is compared with the existing genetic based cloud service composition algorithm based on average utility rate and convergence time. It is proved that the proposed algorithm provides better performance as compared to the existing cloud service composition algorithm. © 2016 International Journal of Advances in Intelligent Informatics.

abstract={Objectives: A buyer in general compares the performance of the products they bought with their expectation with regard to satisfaction. Firms have to constantly meet the expectations of the buyers by means of their offer which meet and exceed the buyers' expectation. This will ensure firms endurance in the competitive environment which may give them competitive advantage to surpass the rest of the players in the market. Honda is one of the biggest firms in India. They have many models of two wheelers for the customers and also they launch many new models every year. This study deals with the consumer attitude and satisfaction towards Honda two wheelers and services at Honda showroom, Tiruvarur in India. This study was conducted to find out the factors influencing consumer behaviour of Honda two wheelers and the factors influencing consumer behaviour of Honda two wheelers. Methods/Analysis: Primary and secondary data were utilised for this study. 230 two wheeler customers of Honda showroom, Thiruvarur was included for this study. In order to find out the respondents' opinion about awareness about Honda two wheelers, model of Honda, celebrity endorsement, price of Honda, employee behaviour in the showroom and level of services at the showroom structured questionnaire was used. In order to test the structured questionnaire, 20 respondents were used for pilot study. For Data analysis Software package SPSS was used. Statistical techniques like Chi-square test, Factor analysis and percentage analysis were used to analyse the collected data. Findings: From the analysis it is inferred that majority of the customers are highly satisfied with Honda two wheelers and the dealer of Honda motors) in Tiruvarur. Majority of the customers were highly loyal and satisfied (except vehicle provided with the reasonable amount of fuel at the time of delivery) with the service at the showroom. At the time of purchase, customers should be educated towards handling and maintenance of two wheelers and dealers have to ensure the availability of spare parts. Applications/Improvements: This study was conducted in rural area to understand the customer opinion about the Honda two wheelers and showroom experience. Automobile dealers have opportunities to meet the buyers in person and can contact them. In order to understand the buyers' opinion of Honda two wheelers and showroom, dealers have to conduct these kinds of surveys periodically.},

abstract={Objectives: This paper aims at making an empirical analysis on such factors that play a role of motivator in enhancing the aspect of entrepreneurship among women, with special reference to Thanjavur district. This paper also focuses attention on the challenges faced by women in the pursuit of entrepreneurship. Methods/Analysis: Descriptive research design was used. The primary data was collected from 400 samples from rural and urban areas of Thanjavur district using a structured questionnaire with the help of survey and snow ball sampling method. The data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and factor analysis. Findings: The result of the motivational factors indicates that financial need motivates women to the highest degree to become entrepreneurs compared to other factors like supplementing the family income, improve the social status, etc. Further, the study has used Rotated component Matrix to factorise the important motivational factors. The result of the Rotated component matrix reveals that the twelve variables were subjected to extraction method and finally the five factors were analysed. The first factor reveals that women have taken up this venture as a pass time activity and continue in the family occupation. Further the study also reveals that they have taken up such entrepreneurial venture to be economically independent and to improve the social status. The result also suggested that unfavourable market conditions and the stringent legal and regulatory conditions have been more challenging than the other problems. Finally the result shows that the women entrepreneurs have faced lot of personal challenges due to lack of information and imbalance between work and family life. Applications/Improvements: Thanjavur district has faced failures in the agricultural sector in the recent past due to failures in monsoon, water scarcity, etc. This has caused large scale unemployment and migration to urban industry creating huge quantum of socio, economic and cultural problems in the district. With mushrooming higher educational institutions in the district coupled with a high female literacy rate of 76.50 per cent (as per 2011 census), the researchers aim to concentrate on women entrepreneurship development, resulting in alternative sources of income for the district.},

Findings: The findings pointed out that level of pay satisfaction among employees may be improved by evaluating performances based on various performance rating measures. It is expected that employee performance level, motivation level and level of satisfaction may increase when the factors of competency pay expected by the employee are satisfied. Applications/Improvement: The present study enhances the understanding of connection between pay variable system and the satisfaction level of employees which in turn determines the employee performance on the job.},

abstract={Objectives: To investigate the usage and preferences for mobile and mobile services among respondents in rural and urban areas of delta districts of Tamil Nadu and identify their impact on digital divide. Analysis: The research was conducted across various parts of Tiruchirapalli and Thanjavur districts of Tamil Nadu. A sample of 340 respondents (140 in rural areas and 200 in urban areas) was approached with a questionnaire (bilingual-Tamil and English) having pre-tested items. Convenience sampling method was used. Appropriate statistical tools were employed to analyse the basic data. Multiple- Regression was used to build the digital divide model. Findings: The analysis has pointed out the usage pattern of the rural and urban respondents across mobile-oriented and mobile-service oriented factors. Further the model indicates the extent of influence of these two variables in creating the digital divide. The service providers need to improve the standard of service in rural markets to strategically narrow down the existing digital gap. Similarly, the online activities of the rural population are also limited to messaging and few mobile applications. Mobile handset manufacturers should promote the use of smart phones in rural areas by introducing customise, affordable and feature rich models. With such a digital gap existing, it may slow down the development process and may restrict the beneficiaries from getting the government's aids on time. The people in both urban and rural areas too should familiarise themselves with the use of various online services of the government and other voluntary organisations. Though the data usage is relatively low, the trend has picked up as the rural youth are familiar with these technologies. Applications/Improvements: This study has taken into consideration, two major communication factors viz., mobile and mobile service and investigated their impact on digital divide which is a new orientation in this area.},

This shows that the study respondents feel that it is impossible to make in India with the present knowledge about the modern manufacturing concepts. Adequate knowledge about the concepts of Logistics Quality Management and Production planning and Control were not found among the respondents. The respondents were also not much aware about the adoption of production concepts in the Indian manufacturing industries. The study revealed that there is no significant difference in the knowledge about the manufacturing concepts between the Rural and Urban people. Applications/Improvements: The novelty lies in estimation of Make in India Possibilities from the awareness towards Production Planning and Control, Logistics and Quality concepts by building Multiple regression model.},

Methods and Analysis: The primary data were collected through the questionnaire from the women employees in IT companies in Chennai following random sampling method. In order to collect the data for the analysis, 250 questionnaires were distributed to the women employees of various departments in IT sector. From the 250 samples, 220 were responded. The data were analyzed using percentage analysis and ANOVA single factor with the help of SPSS package. Findings: The women in the corporate are drained because of the existing corporate cultures and missed prospects to find successful careers. Ultimately, they decide to eschew the organization. The major obstacle to women career development is culture involved inside their work place, and their capacity building nature. Based on age and marital status the women are valued in their job. The government should enhance the awareness of gender inequality and act as a catalyst to promote gender equality to reap the benefits on women and community at large. Employers should also act proactive in their obligation to gender diversity and equity prior to breaking down the barriers of structural, organizational and cultural factors.

abstract={Background/Objectives: The expansion of banking channels from branch to off-site formats have ushered in changes in the banking habits of customers across geographies. The expansion of the channels by banks were mainly intended as experience enhancement tools in addition to migrating the customers and reduce the operational costs through brick and mortar format. But whether the improvements in the channel paradigm have reached the urban, semi urban and rural banking customer is a big question and the study is intended to bring out the channel usage matrix of customers across banks and across geographies and the impact of these channels on the last mile customers having accounts across banks. Methods/Analysis: The study analyzed the awareness and usage pattern of ATM, Internet and Mobile Banking among 200 bank customers through a structured questionnaire. The collected data was analyzed using SPSS. The gap between the awareness and usage level was found out. In addition to that, correlation and regression analysis were also carried out. Findings: The results of the study confirmed that whether the channel offerings by banks are really reaching customers across rural, semi urban and urban bank customers and translate into usage more than the awareness. Applications/Improvements: The implications for banks will be two fold. It will help banks to know the awareness level of their digital channels among their customers. It will also enable them to undertake research on the usage level of their channels across customer segments and retune their strategies for maximum penetration as well as usage.},

abstract={Background/Objectives: This study reveals the propensity of rural customers towards various retail formats during the purchase of both durables and non-durables. Capturing the behavior pattern of rural customers will shed us light as there is a vast change in the buying behavior of rural consumers. As a result, retail giants have developed many strategies to create huge market space and they have realized that all the rural consumers do not have common buying behavior. Hence this study is very much necessary to find out the perception of rural customers during the purchase of both durable and non-durable products with respect to various retail format shops. Methods/Analysis: Mean and standard deviation was calculated and the difference between the population groups as samples was found out using ANOVA. Findings: The results of the study confirmed that rural consumers prefer to go to nearby Kirana shops (mean = 3.19), weekly markets (3.1717) followed by street hawkers (3.1196). For purchasing durables they prefer to go to retail outlets and for non-durables they preferred weekly markets and retail outlets. Applications/Improvements: The managerial implications of the present study will thus help retailers to frame effective marketing strategies to face the competition.},

abstract={Objectives: Consumption as a whole in an economy is a function of income. In other words the household aggregate consumption in an economy largely depends on its Income. This study examines basically the consumption pattern at rural and urban level in BRICS nations. Methodology and Analysis: The study also evaluates the influence and relationship of macroeconomic variables on rural and urban consumption. For the purpose of the study, World Development Indicators (WDI) data from World Bank is used. The time series data of BRICS nations for a period from 1991-2014, on rural and urban consumption, and its relationship with variables like, Gross National Income (GNI), Industrial Production Rate (IPR), and Inflation Rate (IR), Bank Credit (BC), Bank Lending Interest Rate (BLIR) are analysed using Multiple Regression model and Co-integration analysis. Findings: From the above analysis it may be observed that there is divergence in the rural and urban household final consumption in BRICS nations before and after becoming as a group. There exists inequality in the influence of macroeconomic variables and their relationship between BRICS nations. Applications/Improvements: The analysis gives scope for further study of consumption pattern in other regions and can be improved by adding other influencing variables.},

abstract={Background/Objectives: Brand image is a powerful asset which can be easily reached with the customer through an advertisement medium. A well recognized and trusted brand identity makes the product to reach the customer's heart long lasting. This brand identity conjures up pictures in the psyches of the customer. The Brand image is an amalgamation of the individual's experience based on internal and external sources. even though advertisements play a lead role in creating and re-regulating the brand image, personal experience and the persuasion of the customers may shift the customer's mindset. Thus, it is very much vital to analyze the impact of advertisements and its role in creating a Brand image through the perception of rural customers. Methods/Statistical Tools: Based on the first objective, it is observed that the mean score of "Effect/impact of advertising can change as the brand grows older" is high (3.30) among rural customers. Factor analysis is then applied to reduce the factors and how it impacts brand image. Findings: The major factors extracted are Ads exposure, Quality Products, Purchase frequency, Product comparison, Brand image. The impact of advertisement on Brand image was found by using regression analysis and a proposed model for the study was constructed. Application/ Improvements: The current study analyzes the factors regarding the influence of advertisements among rural consumers which paves way to formulate various promotion strategies by the marketers.},

abstract={Information Security is an important issue in the present multimedia communication. Especially, image protection is most challenging task in the field of Internet communications, media identification, tracking, health care and biomedical applications. Image scrambling is a prominent technique to shuffle all the pixels in the original image into different index positions to change the order of the pictorial arrangement. The appearance of resultant image is fully non-recognizable format to the outside viewers. This is a preliminary and final process of security related applications such as information hiding, cryptography and network security. In this paper, an efficient image scrambling technique has been proposed for medical images. A Secret image has transformed into two dimensional matrix formats and generate key file by arranging the pixel intensities sequentially. The circular fill technique is used to compute the new structure of matrix and perform the binary transformation of all index positions. Finally, we implement the LSB substitution technique to obtain the scrambled image. We have also proposed some quality metrics to measure the quality of restored image. Our experimental results emphasize the high level protection of medical images and restored with high visual quality.},

Several Decision tree algorithms have been used to classify the brain tumor and its types. A non-backtracking decision tree algorithm c4.5 adopts greedy approach in which decision trees are constructed in top down recursive divide and conquer manner. This algorithm predicts categorical class label with discrete attributes. But some of the cases it is hard to classify the subtypes because of distance based attribute and it leads to less prediction accuracy, which is the major drawback. To overcome this issue, this projected work proposed a new technique called Minimum Spanning Tree Classifier (MSTC) which improves the classification accuracy in terms of removing irrelevant features from distance valued attributes, which leads to achieve an efficient prediction. This proposed MSTC helps to predict the category of the brain tumor with accuracy and which leads to proper discretion for medical treatment.},

abstract={Mobile ad hoc networks offers new challenges and goals in fault tolerant computing area. Fault tolerance is achieved with or without knowledge about neighbors. High mobility of nodes results in path failures, which degrades the performance of networks and affects the entire network connectivity. A scheme termed as Reliable Stable Path Routing (RSPR) is proposed for achieving fault tolerance level and maximum packet delivery rate. To balance the fault tolerance level and load balancing, multipath routing with stability metric is proposed. The proposed approach improves the network lifetime and network performance. Based on the less packet loss rate, more residual energy and transmission probability, reliable forwarding nodes are chosen. Packets are routed based on the location of reliable nodes. A new channel is discovered for efficient packet delivery with stability. In the final stage of the proposed approach, target node's locality is updated to all the reliable forwarding nodes. This update improves the fault tolerance, packet delivery probability and reduces the network load. The outcomes of simulation shows that the protocol RSPR produces enhanced performance when compared with the schemes LAER and CDN. © 2016 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.},

Flexible and adaptive structure may lead to clear cut definition of job descriptions, roles and responsibilities, authority and communication patterns which in turn provides the successful implementation of TQM programs. Against the backdrop of development in manufacturing process, technology, regulatory compliances and distribution system, small pharma companies develop the ability to produce cost-effective and affordable medicines. All these factors are making SMEs to grow in the sector. Thus, the present study scrutinized the relationship between the organization structure and the implementation of TQM programs and practices. The result imparted that organization structure is one of the factor which relatively influences the success of implementation of TQM programs in small pharma manufacturing firms.},

The key area of apprehension is that non-sensitive data could convey insightful information such as facts and interesting patterns. Privacy preserving data mining (PPDM) is a new track in data mining which focuses on hiding individual's characteristics without compromising the data usability. The primary idea of privacy preserving data mining is to perform data mining on confidential data. In the proposed approach we have formulated rules for the given data set. A Neural Network is constructed based on these rules. The output of the neural network is used as a noise for perturbing the original data. Experiments were conducted using the dataset available in the UCI machine repository. K-Means clustering algorithm is used for the validation purpose. This algorithm is applied to the original data (D) and the modified data (D') to compute the misclassification error.},

abstract={Antifreeze proteins (AFP) observed in cold-adapting organisms bind to ice crystals and prevent further ice growth. However, the molecular mechanism of AFP-ice binding and AFP-inhibited ice growth remains unclear. Here we report the interaction of the insect antifreeze protein (Tenebrio molitor, TmAFP) with ice crystal by molecular dynamics simulation studies. Two sets of simulations were carried out at 263 K by placing the protein near the primary prism plane (PP) and basal plane (BL) of the ice crystal. To delineate the effect of temperatures, both the PP and BL simulations were carried out at 253 K as well. The analyses revealed that the protein interacts strongly with the ice crystal in BL simulation than in PP simulation both at 263 K and 253 K. Further, it was observed that the interactions are primarily mediated through the interface waters. We also observed that as the temperature decreases, the interaction between the protein and the ice increases which can be attributed to the decreased flexibility and the increased structuring of the protein at low temperature. In essence, our study has shed light on the interaction mechanism between the TmAFP antifreeze protein and the ice crystal. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim},

abstract={Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed to study the hydrogen-bonding in the DMSO-water and DMF-water complexes. Quantitative molecular electrostatic potential (MESP) and atoms-in-molecules (AIM) analysis are applied to quantify the relative complexation of DMSO and DMF with water molecules. The interaction energy of DMSO with water molecules was higher than in DMF-water complexes. The existence of cooperativity effect helps in the strong complex formation. A linear dependence was observed between the hydrogen bond energies EHB, and the total electron densities in the BCP’s of microsolvated complexes which supports the existence of cooperativity effect for the complexation process. Due to the stronger DMSO/DMF and water interaction, the water molecules in the formed complexes have a different structure than the isolated water clusters. NCI analysis shows that the steric area is more pronounced in DMF-water complex than the DMSO-water complex which accounts for the low stability of DMF-water complexes compared to the DMSO-water complex.

abstract={Background Hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) is well known to protect the heart from ischemia reperfusion injury by specifically modulating the mitochondrial adenosine-triphosphate-linked potassium channel, thereby preserving mitochondrial function. The present study is designed to investigate the H 2 S preconditioning effect specifically on the mitochondrial subpopulation, namely, interfibrillar (IFM) and subsarcolemmal (SSM) mitochondria. Methods Isolated heart perfusion model with the method of Langendorff was used to induce reperfusion injury in rat hearts. The animals were randomly divided into five groups: normal, ischemia (ISC), reperfusion (IR), preconditioning (IPC), and H 2 S preconditioning (HIPC). All the groups, except normal and ischemia, were subjected to 30-min global ischemia followed by 60-min reperfusion with Krebs-Henseleit buffer. Results Our study results show that H 2 S at a dose of 20 μM significantly (P &lt;.05) reduced the infarct size (59%) and the creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase activity in cardiac tissue. DNA fragmentation as observed in ischemia reperfusion control was absent in case of H 2 S-preconditioned heart. On comparing the classical protection provided by IPC with H 2 S, a significant recovery was seen in the IFM fraction in case of HIPC, whereas the SSM could not recover as evidenced by better mitochondrial respiration rate and electron chain enzyme activities. Studies on isolated mitochondrial subpopulation from normal, IR, and IPC hearts exposed to H 2 S in vitro support the above observation. Conclusion The present study concluded that IFM shows major contribution towards H 2 S-mediated cardioprotection, whereas classical IPC recovered both subpopulations from IR injury. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) are extensively used in a wide variety of commercial products including sunscreens, textiles and paints It is a known fact that ZnO NPs are not stable when dispersed in water, therefore manufacturers use several surface modifying agents to increase the stability of ZnO NPs. In the present study, ZnO NPs were synthesized via chemical co-precipitation with and without the use of surface modifying agents including ethylene glycol (EG), gelatin, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). Preliminary characterization was done by UV-Visible spectroscopy. Electron microscopic analysis showed that the particles were hexagonal in shape. The hydrodynamic size distribution was analyzed by using dynamic light scattering method and crystalline nature was determined by X-ray diffraction method. The study evaluated the photocatalytic, antibacterial and antibiofilm activities of the particles with and without the addition of surface modifying agents. The capping of the particle was confirmed by FT-IR spectroscopy. The photocatalytic activity was checked against methylene blue. Capping of the particles reduced the photocatalytic activity of the particles. The antibacterial and antibiofilm activities were checked against Staphylococcus aureus (MTCC 3160) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MTCC 1688). Antibacterial activity was analyzed by simple plate count method both under dark as well as light condition. Antibiofilm activity was checked in both pre- and post-biofilm formation period under both dark as well as light condition. The activity was evaluated via crystal violet staining method. All the particles showed good antibacterial and antibiofilm activities. © 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={6-azauridine (AzU), a pyrimidine nucleoside antimetabolite, was known to inhibit the growth of microorganism and transplantable tumors. The binding affinity of AzU to blood serum proteins might influence the effectiveness of the drug. Herein, we investigated the interaction of AzU with bovine serum albumin (BSA) under near physiological conditions. Fluorescence spectroscopy analysis revealed that AzU strongly quenched the intrinsic fluorescence of BSA through a static quenching procedure, and a non-radiation energy transfer occurred within the molecules. Thermodynamic parameter determined from the temperature dependent binding constant suggests that the interaction of AzU with BSA is governed by enthalpic forces with a negative entropic contribution. Displacement studies and protein/drug docking studies suggest that AzU binds non-competitively to both sub-domain IIA and sub-domain IIIA of BSA. The obtained results reveal that AzU can bind to BSA with considerable affinity even in the presence of coexisting drug and can be used along with other drugs. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction is considered to be the main manifestation in the pathology of ischemia reperfusion injury, and by restoring its functional activity, hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a novel endogenous gaseotransmitter renders cardioprotection. Given that interfibrillar (IFM) and subsarcolemmal (SSM) mitochondria are the two main types in the heart, the present study investigates the specific H2S-mediated action on IFM and SSM during ischemic reperfusion in the Langendorff rat heart model. Rats were randomly divided into five groups, namely normal, ischemic control, reperfusion control (I/R), ischemic post-conditioning (POC), and H2S post-conditioning (POC_H2S). In reperfusion control, cardiac contractility decreased, and lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, and infracted size increased compared to both normal and ischemic group. In hearts post-conditioned with H2S and the classical method improved cardiac mechanical function and decreased cardiac markers in the perfusate and infarct size significantly. Both POC and POC_H2S exerts its cardioprotective effect of preserving the IFM, as evident by significant improvement in electron transport chain enzyme activities and mitochondrial respiration. The in vitro action of H2S on IFM and SSM from normal and I/R rat heart supports H2S and mediates cardioprotection via IFM preservation. Our study indicates that IFM play an important role in POC_H2S mediated cardioprotection from reperfusion injury. © 2016, Cell Stress Society International.},

abstract={Monocrotophos (MCP) and dichlorvos (DDVP) belong to the group of organophosphate pesticides and are categorized as highly toxic by the World Health Organization. Consumption of oranges containing MCP and DDVP leads to harmful health effects such as DNA damage, apoptosis, cardiotoxicity and cancer. It also causes chronic disorders such as eye irritation, miosis, blurred vision; dizziness, convulsions, dyspnea salivation, abdominal cramps, nausea, diarrhea and vomiting. In this context, an acetylcholinesterase modified Pt working electrode for the simultaneous detection of MCP and DDVP in orange samples was fabricated using zinc oxide nanospheres as a nano-interface. An analytical method for the simultaneous detection of MCP and DDVP was constructed by establishing 24 linear regression models and error analysis was performed to verify the practicability of these models. The developed biosensor achieved a detection limit of MCP and DDVP with detection limits of 0.036 and 0.012 nM respectively. AChE enzyme was successfully reactivated using 2-pyridine aldoxime methiodide. The developed biosensor exhibited good recovery, thus providing a promising tool for analysis of MCP and DDVP. © 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Sensitive micro-bolometer devices require a sensor layer of high temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) value with low resistance to reduce noise. Since it is difficult to produce vanadium pentoxide (V 2 O 5 ) with high TCR and low resistance values, a sandwich type architecture approach was chosen, in which V 2 O 5 /V/V 2 O 5 structure was formed using reactive direct current magnetron sputtering technique by varying the argon (Ar) and oxygen (O 2 ) ratio. On increasing the O 2 partial pressure, an increase in the crystallinity of the V 2 O 5 film was observed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies, which was due to the availability of abundant oxygen to form V 2 O 5 . X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) result of V 2 O 5 /V/V 2 O 5 indicated a decrease in V2p peak and increase in O1s peak, confirmed the multilayer had mixed vanadium oxide phases of V 3+ and V 2+ oxides of vanadium due to the diffusion of oxygen from top and bottom V 2 O 5 layer into the V metal layer.

abstract={We report here the potential competency of MnCO3 versus MnO2 for supercapacitor applications. MnCO3 was synthesized by a hydrothermal method using KMnO4 as a manganese source and either sugar or pyrrole as carbon source. MnCO3 synthesized using sugar and pyrrole as carbon source is referred hereafter as MnCO3(s) and MnCO3(p), respectively. The synthesized products were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopic and transmission electron microscopic studies. Microscopic studies revealed that MnO2 possesses micro-flower-like morphology constructed by self-assembled nano-petals. While the morphology of MnCO3(s) is sub-micron size particles of different shape, the morphology of MnCO3(p) is crystalline particles of 10–20 nm dia. The capacitive characteristics of MnO2, MnCO3(s) and MnCO3(p) were evaluated in aqueous 0.1 M Mg(ClO4)2 electrolyte between 0 and 1 V using cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge cycling. Specific capacitance (SC) values of 216 and 296 F g−1 obtained for MnCO3(s) and MnCO3(p) are 35 and 85 % higher than SC value of 160 F g−1 obtained for MnO2, respectively. Besides better capacitive storage characteristics, MnCO3(s) and MnCO3(p) have also exhibited better rate capability and cycle life than MnO2. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Glioma amplified sequence 41(GAS41) is a potent transcription factor that play a crucial role in cell proliferation and survival. In glioblastoma, the expression of GAS41 at both transcriptional and post transcriptional level needs to be tightly maintained in response to cellular signals. Micro RNAs (miRNA) are small non coding RNA that act as important regulators for modulating the expression of various target genes. Studies have shown that several miRNAs play role in the post-transcriptional regulation of GAS41. Here we identified GAS41 as a novel target for endogenous miR-203 and demonstrate an inverse correlation of miR-203 expression with GAS41 in glioma cell lines (HNGC2 and U87). Over expression of miR-203 negatively regulates GAS41 expression in U87 and HNGC2 cell lines. Moreover, miR-203 restrained miR-10b action by suppressing GAS41. GAS41 is essential for repressing p53 in tumor suppressor pathway during cell proliferation. Enforced expression of GAS41 produced contradictory effect on miR-203 but was able to enhance p53 tumor suppressor pathway associated protein. It was also found that miR-203 maintains the stability of p53 as knock down of p53 expression using siRNA resulted in down regulation of pri-miR and mature miR-203 expression. Conversely reconstitution of miR-203 expression induced apoptosis and inhibited migratory property of glioma cells. Taken together, we show that miR-203 is a key negative regulator of GAS41 and acts as tumor suppressor microRNA in glioma. © 2016 Pal et al.

abstract={In this paper, we discuss the inverse problem for a mixed Liénard-type nonlinear oscillator equation x¨ + f(x) x˙ 2+ g(x) x˙ + h(x) = 0 , where f(x) , g(x) and h(x) are arbitrary functions of x. Very recently, we have reported the Lie point symmetries of this equation. By exploiting the interconnection between Jacobi last multiplier, Lie point symmetries and Prelle–Singer procedure, we construct a time-independent integral for the case exhibiting maximal symmetry from which we identify the associated conservative nonstandard Lagrangian and Hamiltonian functions. The classical dynamics of the nonlinear oscillator is also discussed, and certain special properties including isochronous oscillations are brought out. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Wien.},

abstract={Andrographis paniculata Nees is an important medicinal plant found in the tropical regions of the world, which has been traditionally used in Indian and Chinese medicinal systems. It is also used as medicinal food. A. paniculata is found to exhibit anti-inflammatory activities; however, its inhibitory potential on inflammatory Group IIA phospholipases A2(PLA2) and its associated inflammatory reactions are not clearly understood. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the inhibitory/neutralizing potential of ethanolic extract of A. paniculata on the isolated inflammatory PLA2(VRV-PL-VIIIa) from Daboii rusellii pulchella (belonging to Group IIA inflammatory secretory PLA2[sPLA2]) and its associated edema-induced activities in Swiss albino mice. A. paniculata extract dose dependently inhibited the Group IIA sPLA2enzymatic activity with an IC50value of 10.3 ± 0.5 μg/ml. Further, the extract dose dependently inhibited the edema formation, when co-injected with enzyme indicating that a strong correlation exists between lipolytic and pro-inflammatory activities of the enzyme. In conclusion, results of this study shows that the ethanolic extract of A. paniculata effectively inhibits Group IIA sPLA2and its associated inflammatory activities, which substantiate its anti-inflammatory properties. The results of the present study warranted further studies to develop bioactive compound (s) in ethanolic extract of A. paniculata as potent therapeutic agent (s) for inflammatory diseases. © 2016 Pharmacognosy Research Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.},

abstract={Calcium carbide (CaC2), a carcinogen, is widely used for artificial ripening of mangoes. The usage of CaC2 for mango ripening results in serious health issues like neurological disorders, ulcers, hypoxia, memory loss, etc. Identification of artificially ripened mangoes and quantification of CaC2 in such fruits help in prevention of related health problems. The instability of CaC2 in water makes its detection complex. In addition, the diffusion of calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) and acetylene (C2H2) into mangoes makes it more challenging. In this scenario, an electrochemical CaC2 biosensor with a platinum (Pt) working electrode surface modified by a ceria (CeO2) nano-interface and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme has been developed. The mechanism involves competitive inhibition of the Pt/CeO2/AChE bioelectrode by the mixture of calcium peroxide (CaO2) and C2H2. Different aspects of electrode immobilization with the nano-interface were probed using cyclic voltammetric and amperometric studies. The fabricated Pt/CeO2/AChE bioelectrode exhibited a LOD of 0.6 nM with a linear range of 1-20 nM and % recovery in the range of 97.89-104.82. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={Graphene, also referred as reduced graphene oxide (RGO) is prepared by chemical exfoliation method, which delivers specific capacitance of 77 and 40 F g-1 at 0.1 and 1.0 A g-1, respectively in aqueous electrolyte. In order to improve the specific capacitance and high power performance of RGO, composites of RGO are prepared with various carbonaceous 'spacer' materials such as acetylene black (AB), activated carbon (AC), multi-walled carbon nanotube (CNT) and carbon derived from polyaniline (C-PANI). Composites of RGO with spacer materials such as AB, AC and CNT is prepared by mechanically mixing RGO with the spacer materials; whereas, RGO composite with C-PANI is prepared by in situ method. These two different preparation methodologies are adopted to realise its effect on the physical and electrochemical characteristics of the composites. Morphological, X-ray diffraction and Raman data confirm the formation of mixture of few and multi-layered RGO stacks. Surface area analysis and morphological data show that the composite prepared by in situ method is beneficial in achieving higher specific surface area and improved mesoporosity. Specific capacitance of RGO and its composites obtained at 0.1 A g-1 decreased in the order: RGO/C-PANI (165 F g-1) &gt; RGO/AC (121 F g-1) &gt; RGO/AB (107 F g-1) &gt; RGO/CNT (95 F g-1) &gt; pristine RGO (77 F g-1). Capacitance retention of RGO and its composite electrodes (in percentage) at 1.0 A g-1, in comparison with the value obtained at 0.1 A g-1 decreased in the order: RGO/AB (84%) &gt; RGO/CNT (75%) &gt; RGO/AC (71%) &gt; RGO/C-PANI (64%) &gt; pristine RGO (52%). © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Heat removal from a constant temperature heat source is relevant in energy recovery from thermal energy storage systems and catalytic reactors. Experiments were carried out to assess the heat transfer performance of CuO-water nanofluid flowing through a U-shaped minitube (0.9 mm inner diameter) for heat removal from a constant temperature source, with nanoparticle concentration (0.025-0.1 wt%) and volumetric flow rate (0.18-1.25 mL/s) as the independent variables. The thermal conductivity and viscosity of CuO-water nanofluids increased linearly with nanoparticle concentration, with thermal conductivity enhancement higher than that of viscosity increase. The heat transfer rate, heat transfer coefficient and Nusselt number of CuO-water nanofluids were higher than that of water. The improved heat transfer performance of CuO-water nanofluids may be attributed to their improved thermal conductivity and particle migration effects. Our experiments reveal that the heat transfer performance of CuO-water nanofluids in U-shaped minitube is enhanced to a larger extent at the lower flow rates and at an optimum nanoparticle concentration of 0.05 wt%. We believe that the existence of an optimum nanoparticle concentration may be attributed to the enhanced synergistic effect of higher thermal conductivity and particle migration. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Glycation induced amyloid fibrillation is fundamental to the development of many neurodegenerative and cardiovascular complications. Excessive non-enzymatic glycation in conditions such as hyperglycaemia results in the increased accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs). AGEs are highly reactive pro-oxidants, which can lead to the activation of inflammatory pathways and development of oxidative stress. Recently, the effect of non-enzymatic glycation on protein structure has been the major research area, but the role of specific AGEs in such structural alteration and induction of fibrillation remains undefined. In this study, we determined the specific AGEs mediated structural modifications in albumin mainly considering carboxymethyllysine (CML), carboxyethyllysine (CEL), and argpyrimidine (Arg-P) which are the major AGEs formed in the body. We studied the secondary structural changes based on circular dichroism (CD) and spectroscopic analysis. The AGEs induced fibrillation was determined by Congo red binding and examination of scanning and transmission electron micrographs. The amyloidogenic regions in the sequence of BSA were determined using FoldAmyloid. It was observed that CEL modification of BSA leads to the development of fibrillar structures, which was evident from both secondary structure changes and TEM analysis. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Purpose-The purpose of this paper is to develop a mathematical model for metal removal rate and surface roughness through Taguchi method and analyse the influence of the individual input machining parameters (cutting speed, feed rate, helix angle, depth of cut and wt% on the responses in milling of aluminium-titanium diboride metal matrix composite (MMC) with solid carbide end mill cutter coated with nano-crystals. Design/methodology/approach-Taguchi OA is used to optimise the material removal rate (MRR) and Surface Roughness by developing a mathematical model. End Milling is used to create slots by combining various input parameters. Five factors, three-level Taguchi method is employed to carry out the experimental investigation. Fuzzy logic is used to find the optimal cutting factors for surface roughness (Ra) and MRR. The factors considered were weight percentage of TiB2, cutting speed, depth of cut and feed rate. The plan for the experiments and analysis was based on the Taguchi L27 orthogonal array with five factors and three levels. MINITAB 17 software is used for regression, S/N ratio and analysis of variance. MATLAB 7.10.0 is used to perform the fuzzy logics systems. Findings-Using fuzzy logics, multi-response performance index is generated, with which the authors can identify the correct combination of input parameters to get higher MRR and lower surface roughness value with the chosen range with 95 per cent confidence intervals. Using such a model, remarkable savings in time and cost can be obtained. Originality/value-Machinability characteristics in Al-TiB2 MMC based on the Taguchi method with fuzzy logic has not been analysed previously. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Spherical, crystalline ceria nanoparticles of 18-25 nm were synthesized from cerium nitrate precursor. The dispersion of as-synthesized ceria nanoparticles in propylene glycol was achieved through extended probe ultrasonication for 14 h, leading to ceria-propylene glycol nanofluids. The influence of nanoparticle concentration (0-1 vol.%) and temperature on viscosity and thermal conductivity of ceria-propylene glycol nanofluids were investigated. Our data indicate that the higher thermal conductivity enhancement at elevated temperatures (18.8% at 80 °C for 1 vol.% nanofluid) can be attributed to the particle clustering and Brownian-motion induced microconvection. Ceria nanoparticles interact with propylene glycol leading to disturbance in hydrogen bonding network prevalent in propylene glycol. This resulted in lower viscosity of 0.5 vol.% and 1 vol.% ceria-propylene glycol nanofluids than propylene glycol over a wide range of temperatures. The heat absorption by ceria-propylene glycol nanofluids under transient, natural convective heat transfer conditions increased with ceria nanoparticle concentration. Hence ceria-propylene glycol nanofluids are suitable for cooling applications. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Contrary to previous understanding, recent evidence indicates that synonymous codon changes may sometimes face strong selection. However, it remains difficult to generalize the nature, strength, and mechanism(s) of such selection. Previously, we showed that synonymous variants of a key enzyme-coding gene (fae) of Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 decreased enzyme production and reduced fitness dramatically. We now show that during laboratory evolution, these variants rapidly regained fitness via parallel yet variant-specific, highly beneficial point mutations in the N-terminal region of fae. These mutations (including four synonymous mutations) had weak but consistently positive impacts on transcript levels, enzyme production, or enzyme activity. However, none of the proposed mechanisms (including internal ribosome pause sites or mRNA structure) predicted the fitness impact of evolved or additional, engineered point mutations. This study shows that synonymous mutations can be fixed through strong positive selection, but the mechanism for their benefit varies depending on the local sequence context. © 2016 The Author 2016.

abstract={The aim of this work is to design an off-line system, method and experimental set-up for predicting surface roughness (Ra) of metal surfaces with the help of audio signals. The frictional contact between a metal surface and sharp pencil like scratching tool will produce audio signals which vary based on the roughness of the surface. The samples considered to design and validate the concept are work pieces machined with metal cutting processes such as Turning and Grinding. Several audio signals are generated from various types of metal surfaces produced by these processes after the completion of the machining process away from the machining area in an enclosed chamber. The audio waves are captured with the help of a microphone fixed inside the chamber. These audio signals are processed to generate the surface pattern of the relevant surface. The audio signals are then converted to spectrogram and normalized histogram plots with the help of MATLAB, based on which the roughness of the surfaces is predicted. An experimental set-up is designed which provides a sound-proof environment to capture and record the audio signals. The proposed system, method and set-up are validated with the actual surface roughness of the chosen surfaces measured with the help of a surface roughness measurement instrument. © 2016, Korean Society for Precision Engineering and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Epilepsy is a neurological disorder which is characterized by repeated seizures. Although these can be recorded using Electroencephalogram (EEG), it is very difficult task to classify the different states such as normal, preictal and ictal by visual inspection due to the non-linear and non stationary property of the EEG signals and also due to its long term recordings. Thus automatic detection of these states using various techniques has been in the literature for a very long time. We used novel features such as permutation entropy (PE), Tsallis entropy (TsE), Kolmogorov entropy (KE), Reyni entropy (RE) and Sample entropy (SampEn) along with 5 different classifiers. We achieved a highest accuracy of 97% with Decision tree classifier. Our method being very simple and fast can form as a software tool that can be installed easily and also opens future opportunities towards real time detection and prediction of epileptic seizures. © Copyright 2016 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.},

abstract={Development of economical and rapid high yielding industrial processes for isolation of commercially important plant molecules have been in current industrial vogue. Adhatoda vasica, a functional dietary supplemental plant, is found to harbor vasicine, a commercially important and physiologically active alkaloid. Attempts were made to increase the yields of vasicine by a viable "green" process - microwave assisted adsorption based elution (MAABE) with silica gel. Microwave (300 W) assisted extraction was done with 6% HCl/water (solid loading - 10%), which in 4 h yielded vasicine (8.8 mg/g of leaves, 0.88%). A Box-Behnken designed response surface methodology (RSM) optimized the extraction parameters to 9.31% solid loading, 6.64% HCl/water and 4.1 h, respectively. Further, adsorption based elution using silica gel and desorption with 70% ethanol/water yielded pure vasicine (1.12%) (recovery=93%, purity=95%). The adsorption isotherms studied to understand the adsorption mechanism suggested that the process followed the Langmuir theory. MAABE required less time and labor, in addition to its relative safety and as a "green" alternative process, to give high yields of commercially important vasicine. © 2016 by De Gruyter 2016.},

Here we report the inhibitory potential of vanillin toward early and advanced glycation modification and amyloid like aggregation of albumin based on the determination of both early and advanced glycation and conformational changes in albumin using circular dichroism. Inhibition of aggregation and fibrillation of albumin was determined based on amyloid specific dyes i.e., Congo red and Thioflavin T and microscopic imaging. It was evident that vanillin restrains glycation of albumin and exhibits protective effect toward its native conformation. © 2016.},

abstract={This paper attempts to minimize power losses in radial distribution networks and facilitates an enhancement in bus voltage profile by determining optimal locations, optimally sized distributed generators and shunt capacitors by hybrid Harmony Search Algorithm approach. To overcome the drawback of premature and slow convergence of Harmony Search Algorithm (HSA) over multi model fitness landscape, the Particle Artificial Bee Colony algorithm (PABC) is utilized to enhance the harmony memory vector. In the first approach, the formulation echoes the determination of loss sensitivity factor to decide the sensitive nodes and thereafter decides on the optimal rating through the use of hybrid Algorithm. The second approach encircles the role of hybrid Algorithm to search for both the optimal candidate nodes and sizing of compensating devices by significant increase in loss reduction with the former approach. The procedure travels to examine the robustness of the proposed hybrid approach on 33 and 119 node test systems and the result outcomes are compared with the other techniques existing in the literature. The simulation results reveal the efficiency of the proposed hybrid algorithm in obtaining optimal solution for simultaneous placement of distributed generators and shunt capacitors in distribution networks. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

In addition, the suitable formulation was evaluated for hemocompatibility, plasma stability and embryo toxicity using Danio rerio embryo model. The results showed that pACC1 peptide loaded chitosan nanoparticles were compatible with plasma. They possess sustained release pattern and also found to be safe up to 300 mg/L in embryo toxicity tests. Cytotoxicity assays with MDA-MB-231 cell lines suggested that, pACC1 peptide loaded chitosan nanoparticles were capable of enhanced cellular penetration and reduced palmitic acid content, which was confirmed by H1 NMR. Hence, these nanoparticles could be employed as excellent adjuvant therapeutics while treating solid tumors with multi-drug resistance. © 2015, The Author(s).},

abstract={The operating process parameters play a significant role in the quality of a hardened zone obtained during laser transformation hardening. Laser power and specimen travel speed are closely related to the geometry of the hardened zone, but the relationship between them is complicated due to the non-linear characteristics. In this study, a new hybrid methodology using response surface methodology and non-traditional optimization tools (MOGA and NSGA-II) for optimizing hardened zone geometry. The regression equations establish the relationship between the input parameters with the output variables. By this relationship, an attempt is made to minimize the hardened depth and area and maximize the hardened width. Considerable analyses also have been made for finding out, which combination of the optimization parameters (cross over, mutation, number of generation) of MOGA, NSGA-II provide the best Pareto optimal solution. Based on the outcome, it is suggested that the NSGA-II technique is superior to MOGA. © 2016, Chinese Mechanical Engineering Society. All right reserved.},

abstract={One of the benefits of fiber laser welding technology is that the amount of heat generated at the weld position is very less. This method is said to offer a great advantage for today's modern manufacturing needs. The input parameters involved in the laser welding process play an important role in deciding the quality of the weld joint. The various properties that can define the quality of the weld are mechanical aspects, the geometry of the weld bead and distortion. In this research work, the geometry of the weld bead such as ultimate tensile strength, weld bead width, depth of penetration of the laser welded butt joints of mild steel 2062 sheets are examined. With the help of design expert software, the Response Surface Methodology [RSM] was used in developing the empirical relationships relating the process parameters such as laser power, travelling speed and focal position with the output responses such as ultimate tensile strength, depth of penetration and weld bead width. The acceptability of the developed mathematical models is validated with the help of analysis of variance using design expert software. The investigation was further carried out using the desirability approach in achieving an optimal welding combination, such that, it would maximize the ultimate tensile strength, depth of penetration, and minimize the weld bead width. © 2006-2016 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).},

The strong intermolecular interactions (H-bonding, C-H···π and π··· π) restrict the free rotation and rigidify the fluorophores, 1 and 2, in the crystal lattice that lead to enhanced fluorescence in the solid state of 1 (yellow, max = 535 nm, Φf = 38%) and 2 (greenish-yellow, max = 525 nm, Φf = 21%). Surprisingly, nanofabrication of 1 and 2 produced metastable white light emitting nanoparticles (Φf = 24% (1), 19% (2)) that slowly converted into stable yellow (1) or greenish-yellow (2) fluorescent nanoparticles with increasing time. The time dependent fluorescence, morphological, and metal ion interacting studies indicate the formation of soft nanoparticles in which both blue fluorescent cyanophenoxy and yellow/greenish-yellow fluorescent salicylidene group behave independently. 1 and 2 nanoparticles undergo morphological change from spherical to plates with increasing time.

abstract={Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is commonly characterized by a triad of features including multiple seizure types, intellectual disability or regression. LGS type of seizures is epilepsy which is due to abnormal vibrations occurring in seizures. During the time of such abnormal vibrations, both the seizures and the lungs suffer a lack in oxygen content to a considerable extent. These result in prolonged vibrations and loss of nervous control. Perfluorodecalin C 10 F 18 (PFD) and perfluorohexane C 6 F 14 (PFH) which are excellent oxygen carriers are made as an interfacial solution with anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) such as carbamazepine and benzodiazepine with dimethylformamide (DMF) as common solvent. The interfacial solutions were subjected to ultrasonic-laser diffraction (photo-acoustical method). The experimentally measured data were plugged in classical mathematical models to analyze the complete molecular interactions. The estimated structure factor S(Q) and the L-J potential parameter φ (r) reveals that both PFD and PFH co-exist along with AEDs and support the purpose of this study, which is a neuro-lung protective strategy. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Ferrofluids have promising potential for heat transfer applications, as they can be easily controlled and manipulated by applied magnetic field produced by either permanent magnets or electromagnets. The present study reports the effect of magnetic field on the convective heat transfer characteristics of ferrofluid flowing through a circular stainless steel (SS) tube (2. mm ID × 2.6. mm OD) under constant heat flux conditions. The convective heat transfer coefficient for various ferrofluid flow rates and applied magnetic field gradients is reported using infrared thermography (IRT) technique. COMSOL simulation has been carried out to calculate the magnetic field and magnetic force distribution inside the SS tube. Bright field visualization of clusters of nanoparticles and aggregation of nanoparticles at the inner wall of the SS tube in the presence of magnetic field have also been carried out in order to explain the possible mechanism for heat transfer enhancement for ferrofluid in the presence of magnetic field. The convective heat transfer coefficient for ferrofluid flow in the presence of magnetic field may increase or decrease depending upon several factors such as, ratio of magnetic force to inertia force acting on the ferrofluid, interaction of ferrofluid flow with the aggregate of nanoparticles formed at the wall of the tube near the vicinity of the magnets, and enhancement in local thermal conductivity of ferrofluid flow resulting from the chain like clusters of nanoparticles within the ferrofluid in the presence of magnetic field. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={This review discusses the relationship between oxidative stress and cataract formation, molecular mechanism of curcumin action and potential benefits of treatment with the antioxidant curcumin. The first section deals with curcumin and endogenous antioxidants. The second section focuses on the action of curcumin on lipid peroxidation. Calcium homeostasis and curcumin will be discussed in the third section. The fourth section discusses the role of crystallin proteins that are responsible for maintaining lens transparency and the role of curcumin in regulating crystallin expression. The interaction of curcumin with transcription factors will be dealt in the fifth section. The final section will focus on the effect of curcumin on aldose reductase, which is associated with hyperglycemia and cataract. One of the strongest antioxidants is curcumin which has been shown to be very effective against cataract.

abstract={Epithelial cells exhibit apical membrane protrusions, which confer specific functions to epithelial tissues. Microridges are short actin protrusions that are laterally long and form a maze-like pattern in the apical domain. They are widely found on vertebrate squamous epithelia including epidermis and have functions in mucous retention, membrane storage and abrasion resistance. It is largely unknown how the formation of these laterally long actin projections is regulated. Here, we show that antagonistic interactions between aPKC and Lgl-regulators of apical and basolateral domain identity, respectively,-control the length of microridges in the zebrafish periderm, the outermost layer of the epidermis. aPKC regulates the levels of Lgl and the active form of non-muscle myosinII at the apical cortex to prevent actin polymerization-dependent precocious fusion and elongation of microridges. Our data unravels the functional significance of exclusion of Lgl from the apical domain in epithelial cells.},

abstract={Background Peroxidations mediated by heme-enzymes have been traditionally studied under a single-site (heme distal pocket), non-sequential (ping-pong), two-substrates binding scheme of Michaelis-Menten paradigm. We had reported unusual modulations of peroxidase and P450 reaction outcomes and explained it invoking diffusible reactive species [Manoj, 2006; Manoj et al., 2010; Andrew et al., 2011, Parashar et al., 2014 & Venkatachalam et al., 2016]. Methods A systematic investigation of specific product formation rates was undertaken to probe the hypothesis that involvement of diffusible reactive species could explain undefined substrate specificities and maverick modulations (sponsored by additives) of heme-enzymes. Results When the rate of specific product formation was studied as a function of reactants' concentration or environmental conditions, we noted marked deviations from normal profiles. We report that heme-enzyme mediated peroxidations of various substrates are inhibited (or activated) by sub-equivalent concentrations of diverse redox-active additives and this is owing to multiple redox equilibriums in the milieu. At low enzyme and peroxide concentrations, the enzyme is seen to recycle via a one-electron (oxidase) cycle, which does not require the substrate to access the heme centre. Schemes are provided that explain the complex mechanistic cycle, kinetics & stoichiometry. Conclusion It is not obligatory for an inhibitor or substrate to interact with the heme centre for influencing overall catalysis. Roles of diffusible reactive species explain catalytic outcomes at low enzyme and reactant concentrations. Significance The current work highlights the scope/importance of redox enzyme reactions that could occur "out of the active site" in biological or in situ systems. © 2016 Elsevier B.V. and Société française de biochimie et biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).

abstract={Interleaving is a process of making a system efficient by arranging its data in a noncontiguous manner. It is mostly used in wireless communication and storage systems in addition to forward error correcting codes thus enhancing their performance. The quality of digitally transmitted data over the radio fading channel is improved by this process. As every other process, interleaving has its own drawbacks. One is that it brings in time-delay, demand for higher memory and complexity. This paper presents the working and reliability of a convolutionally coded and interleaving in OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) system that can reduce the time delay as well as memory space to a great extent. Then the interleaved outputs are encrypted to provide security to the wireless users. The interleavers used are Row, Helical, Row column and Odd even. BER(Bit Error Rate) graph is plotted among various modulation schemes such as BPSK, QPSK, 8,16,32 and 64 QAM with all four interleavers and identified which interleaver can be adopted to the particular modulation scheme to reduce BER. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={The article mainly focuses on the enrichment of the output power obatined from Spin torque nano-oscillator by introducing the heterogeneous structure in multilayer nanopillar device. Here we devised two homogeneous and two heterogeneous devices having NiFe and Co materials. The dynamics of the devices are governed by a famous Landu- Lifshitz -Gilbert-Solencskwei (LLGS) equation which can be solved numerically usin embedded RK-4 procedure. The current density and the external magnetic field for four devices are taken as 5×l011A/m2 and 6×l0-3 A/m respectively. The applied dc current is converted into spin polarized dc current while it passes through pinned layer. The generated spin polarized dc currents produces spin transfer torque with the free layer magnetization via spacer. Thus the magnetization of the free layer gets a sustained oscillaton. The results obtained from the heterogeneous STNOs are really fascinating. The frequency of the NiFe/ Cu/NiFe and Co/Cu/NiFe devices have the same frequency but there is a tremendous change in the output power which is exactly twice that the NiFe/Cu/NiFe device. The similar behaviour is also obtained from Co/Cu/Co and NiFe/Cu/Co devices. The line width and the Q-factor of the output microwave signal are also computed. Among the four devices, the NiFe/Cu/Co heterogeneous device has low linewidth (408 MHz) and high Q-factor (4.77). © 2016 Author(s).},

abstract={Utilization of recycled aggregate (RA) from crushed concrete wastes as alternative to natural aggregate in construction industry solve the construction and demolition waste (C&DW) disposal problems and reduces the gap between the demand and supply. The adhered mortar affects the properties of RA to significant level. This paper has studied the characteristics of recycled aggregates retrieved from crushed old concrete obtained from demolished structures, and five different presoaking surface treatment method and silica fume impregnating method to improve the properties of the recycled aggregates and its effect on recycled aggregate concrete (RAC). From experimental results it was observed that after treatment there was a significant improvement in the physical and mechanical properties of RA because of adhered mortar removal. The compressive strength was also significantly improved by using treated RA in RAC. Hence it is concluded that these treatment methods can be effectively used for the recycled aggregates to improve its characteristics. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={We investigate the significance of nonisochronicity parameter in a network of nonlocally coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators with symmetry breaking form. We observe that the presence of nonisochronicity parameter leads to structural changes in the chimera death region while varying the strength of the interaction. This gives rise to the existence of different types of chimera death states such as multichimera death state, type I periodic chimera death (PCD) state, and type II periodic chimera death state. We also find that the number of periodic domains in both types of PCD states decreases exponentially with an increase of coupling range and obeys a power law under nonlocal coupling. Additionally, we also analyze the structural changes of chimera death states by reducing the system of dynamical equations to a phase model through the phase reduction. We also briefly study the role of nonisochronicity parameter on chimera states, where the existence of a multichimera state with respect to the coupling range is pointed out. Moreover, we also analyze the robustness of the chimera death state to perturbations in the natural frequencies of the oscillators. © 2016 American Physical Society.},

The LLGS equation is analytically solved for the time independent case and value of the critical current density required to initiate the magnetization switching is calculated. Its value in the absence of BQC is 0.8576×1012 Am-2 and in the presence of BQC its value increases to 1.0914×1012 Am-2. BQC field is acting along the easy axis which opposes the free layer magnetization moving to the out of plane and hence the value of critical current density is high in the presence of BQC. We can reduce the critical current density by reducing the BQC field which can be achieved by making the nanopillar with minimal or no roughness in the pinned and free layer. © 2016 Author(s).},

It is observed that a weak magnetic field moves the domain wall with high velocity in the presence of SHE and the direction of the velocity is changed by changing the direction of the weak field. The numerical results show that the magnetization of the ferromagnetic layer can be reversed quickly through domain wall motion by changing the direction of a weak external field in the presence of SHE while the direction of current is fixed. The SHE reduces the magnetization reversal time of 1000nm length strip by 14.7ns.

abstract={Higher NOx is a major problem in a low heat rejection diesel engine running on biodiesel blends due to high combustion temperature and higher oxygen content in the biodiesel. To comply with future emission regulations, particularly dramatic decrease in NOx emissions, technology needs to keep upgrading; the reduction of the volumetric compression ratio is one of the most promising ways to allow a simultaneous increase in power at full load and NOx trade-off improvement at part load. The change of combustion chamber volume is the result of shifting the cylinder block and cylinder head assembly perpendicularly to the crankshaft axis. In consequence, the compression ratio can be varied from 1:18 to 1:12. This study describes an alumina (Al2O3) coated diesel engine running on rice bran methyl ester blends have been found experimentally by reducing the compression ratio from 18 to 15 and the results were compared to those obtained from an uncoated diesel engine with fixed compression ratio (17.5). Satisfactory performance and better emission were obtained at a compression ratio of 17. At this compression ratio, the reduction of NOx emission was observed as 9.4% for blend20 and 7.2% for blend40 with a minimum decrease in brake specific energy consumption of 3.7% for blend20 and 2.2% for blend40. An increase in brake thermal efficiency was observed as 3.5% for blend20 and 2.5% for blend40 when compared to fixed compression ratio (17.5) of uncoated engine with diesel fuel operation. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) were implicated in pathology of numerous diseases. In this study, we present the bioactivity of aspartic acid (Asp) to inhibit the AGEs. Hemoglobin and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were glycated with glucose, fructose, and ribose in the presence and absence of Asp (100-200 M). HbA1c inhibition was investigated using human blood and characterized by micro-column ion exchange chromatography. The effect of methyl glyoxal (MG) on hemoglobin and BSA was evaluated by fluorescence spectroscopy and gel electrophoresis. The effect of MG on red blood cells morphology was characterized by scanning electron micrographs. Molecular docking was performed on BSA with Asp. Asp is capable of inhibiting the formation of fluorescent AGEs by reacting with the reducing sugars. The presence of Asp as supplement in whole blood reduced the HbA1c% from 8.8 to 6.1. The presence of MG showed an increase in fluorescence and the presence of Asp inhibited the glycation thereby the fluorescence was quenched. MG also affected the electrophoretic mobility of hemoglobin and BSA by forming high molecular weight aggregates. Normal RBCs showed typical biconcave shape. MG modified RBCs showed twisted and elongated shape whereas the presence of ASP tends to protect RBC from twisting. Asp interacted with arginine residues of bovine serum albumin particularly ARG 194, ARG 198, and ARG 217 thereby stabilized the protein complex. We conclude that Asp has dual functions as a chemical chaperone to stabilize protein and as a dicarbonyl trapper, and thereby it can prevent the complications caused by glycation. © 2015 Taylor and Francis.},

abstract={Background: RNA interference (RNAi) technology using short interfering RNA (si-RNA) has shown immense potential in the treatment of cancers through silencing of specific genes. Cationic non-viral vectors employed for gene delivery exhibit toxic effects in normal cells limiting their widespread use, therefore, site-specific delivery using benign carriers could address this issue. Objective: Design of a non-toxic carrier that enables site-specific delivery of si-RNA into the cancer cells is of prime importance to realize the promise of gene silencing. Methods: In the present study, non-cationic liposomes encapsulating si-RNA against epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) were developed and characterized for encapsulation efficiency, colloidal stability, in vitro and in vivo gene silencing efficacy. Results: PEGylated liposomes containing phosphatidyl choline and phosphatidyl ethanolamine exhibited maximum si-RNA encapsulation efficiency of 47%, zeta potential of -21 mV, phase transition temperature of 51 °C and good colloidal stability in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing bovine serum albumin (BSA) and plasma protein (PP) at 37 °C. Conjugation of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) antibody to the liposomes resulted in enhanced cell internalization and superior down-regulation of EpCAM gene in MCF-7 cell lines when compared with free si-RNA and the non-targeted liposomes. In vivo evaluation of immunoliposomes for their efficacy in regressing the tumor volume in Balb/c SCID mice showed about 35% reduction of tumor volume in comparison with the positive control when administered with an extremely low dose of 0.15 mg/kg twice a week for 4 weeks. Conclusion: Our results exhibit that the nanocarrier-mediated silencing of EpCAM gene is a promising strategy to treat epithelial cancers. © 2014 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Air-water two phase flows have been characterized using acoustic measurement and sound processing. Analysis is carried in a mini channel of diameter 1.8 mm. Sound of frequency 21500 Hz is emitted using a sound emitter held over the glass tube. A microphone is kept on the other side of the glass tube and acts as the acoustic electric transducer through which the sound signal is acquired using the microphone and is processed using an open source sound processing software AUDACITY 2.0. Filtering and amplification of sound signal is done using the software to study the two phase flow characteristics. Bubbly, Slug and Annular flow regimes are identified. The method can be used to characterize two phase flows without sophisticated instruments. © 2016, National Institute of Science Communication and Information Resources (NISCAIR).

abstract={Objectives: To find out the effect of the extract of Calophyllum inophyllum leaves on the streptozotocin-induced oxidative stress complications in mice. Methods: The plant extract was first checked for its radical scavenging activity by the 2,2-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl hydrate (DPPH) method and L-ascorbic acid was used as the standard. DPPH assay activity of the plant extract was found to be close to the standard drug ascorbic acid. Acute toxicity was conducted as per OECD 425 guidelines. From the results obtained, 250, 300, and 350 mg/kg dose were chosen for further experimentation. After 16 days of drug treatment, glucose, cholesterol, triglyceride and enzymatic antioxidants levels were estimated in serum samples. Results: C. inophyllum leaves extract has significantly reduced the glucose, cholesterol, triglyceride and enzymatic antioxidants levels. Hence, this proves that the plant has anti-diabetic property. However, vitamin E had no effect on the triglyceride level. Antioxidant activity was monitored by superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, malondialdehyde assay and it was found that the plant extract has effectively increased the antioxidant activity as the dose increases. Conclusion: C. inophyllum leaves extract have anti-diabetic activity and effective in curbing the oxidative stress complications. © 2016, Innovare Academics Sciences Pvt. Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Industrialization and urbanization are the two phenomena that are going relentless all over the world. The consequence of this economic success has been a massive increase in waste on one hand and increasing demand for suitable sites for construction on the other. Owing to the surplus raw materials and energy requirement needed for manufacturing synthetic fibers, applications of waste fibers for reinforcing soils evidenced to offer economic and environmental benefits. The main objective of the proposed work is to explore the possibilities of improving the strength of soil using fly ash waste as an admixture and Human Hair Fiber (HHF) as reinforcement such that they can be used for construction of embankments and land reclamation projects. The effect of fiber content on soil – fly ash mixture was observed through a series of laboratory tests such as compaction tests, CBR and unconfined compression tests. From the stress - strain curves, it was observed that the UCC strength for the optimised soil – flyash mixture reinforced with 0.75% human hair fibers is nearly 2.85 times higher than that of the untreated soil. Further, it has been noticed that there is about 7.73 times increase in CBR for the reinforced soil compared to untreated soil. This drastic increase in strength may be due to the fact that HHF offer more pull-out resistance which makes the fibers act like a bridge to prevent further cracking and thereby it improves the toughness which in turn prevent the brittle failure of soil-flyash specimen. Hence, the test results reveal that the inclusion of randomly distributed HHF in soil significantly improves the engineering properties of soil and can be effectively utilized in pavements. SEM analysis explained the change of microstructures and the formation of hydration products that offered increase in strength and it was found to be in accordance with strength tests. © 2016 Techno-Press, Ltd.},

abstract={This paper proposes a novel encryption scheme based on combining multiple chaotic maps to ensure the safe transmission of medical images. The proposed scheme uses three chaotic maps namely logistic, tent and sine maps. To achieve an efficient encryption, the proposed chao-cryptic system employs a bio-inspired crossover and mutation units to confuse and diffuse the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) image pixels. The crossover unit extensively permutes the image pixels row-wise and column-wise based on the chaotic key streams generated from the Combined Logistic-Tent (CLT) system. Prior to mutation, the pixels of the crossed over image are decomposed into two images with reduced bit depth. The decomposed images are then mutated by XOR operation with quantized chaotic sequences from Combined Logistic-Sine (CLS) system. In order to validate the sternness of the proposed algorithm, the developed chao-cryptic scheme is subjected to various security analyses such as statistical, differential, key space, key sensitivity, intentional cropping attack and chosen plaintext attack analyses. The experimental results prove the proposed DICOM cryptosystem has achieved a desirable amount of protection for real time medical image security applications. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

AgNPs were characterized using UV-vis spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), transmission electron microscope (TEM), scanning electron microscope (SEM), Zeta potential and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX). Interestingly, bio-functionalized AgNPs displayed higher antioxidant activity in terms of reducing power on ferric ion (1.83 AU) and phosphomolybdate (2127 Ascorbic acid Equivalent Antioxidant Activity) and radical scavenging activity against superoxide (IC50 value 46.25 μg/ml) and DPPH radicals (IC50 value 50.12 μg/ml) compared to the standard. AgNPs has also exhibited cytotoxic effect with IC 50 value of 204 and 129 μg/ml against EAC and HT-29 cancer cell lines, respectively which indicates the AgNPs are effective than that of commercially available drug.

abstract={Electrospun nanofibers are attractive candidates for neural regeneration due to similarity to the extracellular matrix. Several synthetic polymers have been used but they lack in providing the essential biorecognition motifs on their surfaces. Self-assembling peptide nanofiber scaffolds (SAPNFs) like RADA16 and recently, designer SAPs with functional motifs RADA16-I-BMHP1 areexamples, which showed successful spinal cord regeneration. But these peptide nanofiber scaffolds have poor mechanical properties and faster degradation rates that limit their use for larger nerve defects. Hence, we have developed a novel hybrid nanofiber scaffold of polymer poly(l-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) and RADA16-I-BMHP1. The scaffolds were characterized for the presence of peptides both qualitatively and quantitatively using several techniques like SEM, EDX, FTIR, CHN analysis, Circular Dichroism analysis, Confocal and thermal analysis. Peptide self-assembly was retained post-electrospinning and formed rod-like nanostructures on PLGA nanofibers. In vitro cell compatibility was studied using rat Schwann cells and their adhesion, proliferation and gene expression levels on the designed scaffolds were evaluated. Our results have revealed the significant effects of the peptide blended scaffolds on promoting Schwann cell adhesion, extension and phenotypic expression. Neural development markers (SEM3F, NRP2 & PLX1) gene expression levels were significantly upregulated in peptide blended scaffolds compared to the PLGA scaffolds. Thus the hybrid blended novel designer scaffolds seem to be promising candidates for successful and functional regeneration of the peripheral nerve. © 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Inflammation is part of the non-specific immune response that occurs in reaction to any type of bodily injury. In some disorders the inflammatory process, which under normal conditions is self-limiting, becomes continuous and chronic inflammatory diseases develop subsequently including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer etc. Barks of Delonix regia is used traditionally in the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Therefore, in this study we evaluated the therapeutic potential of D. regia ethanol extract and its active constituent β-Elemene with special interest in inflammation model using standard in vivo anti-inflammatory models: Carrageenan-induced paw edema, Cotton pellet granuloma, and Acetic acid-induced vascular permeability. To explicate the mechanism of action for the possible anti-inflammatory activity, we determined the level of major inflammatory mediators (NO, iNOS, COX-2-dependent prostaglandin E2 or PGE2), and pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-6, and IL-12). Additionally, we determined the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), Myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88), by mRNA expression in drug treated LPS-induced murine macrophage model. To explore the mechanism of anti-inflammatory activity, we evaluated expression of c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), nuclear factor kappa-B cells (NF-kB), and NF-kB inhibitor alpha (IK-Ba). Furthermore, we determined the acute and sub-acute toxicity of D. regia extract in BALB/c mice. This study established a significant anti-inflammatory activity of D. regia extract and β-Elemene along with the inhibition of TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-6 and IL-12 expressions. Further, the expression of TLR4, NF-kBp65, MyD88, iNOS and COX-2 molecules were reduced in drug-treated groups, but not in the LPS-stimulated untreated or control groups, Thus, our results collectively indicated that the D. regia extract and β-Elemene can efficiently inhibit inflammation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The use of solvent-free, high-speed vibration milling conditions has allowed the development of a one-pot telescoped process for the synthesis of pyrroles starting from ketones, primary amines, and β-dicarbonyl compounds and comprising an initial α-iodination followed by an in situ three-component Hantzsch-type reaction. This method was compared with a solution-based protocol from α-iodoketones, primary amines, and β-dicarbonyl compounds. Although both protocols were far more general than previous Hantzsch-type pyrrole syntheses, the mechanochemical method was superior in that it afforded considerably higher yields in spite of comprising an additional step. The stereochemical integrity of the pyrroles obtained from chiral α-aminoesters was maintained. This solvent-free method was also used for the efficient preparation of ter- and quater-aryl/heteroaryl frameworks containing two pyrrole units and a variety of fused pyrrole systems, including benzo[g]indoles, indeno[1,2-b]pyrroles, indoles, and homoindoles. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

abstract={Wheel slip compensation is vital for building accurate and reliable dead reckoning based robot localization and mapping algorithms. This investigation presents stochastic slip compensation scheme for robot localization and mapping. Main idea of the slip compensation technique is to use wheelslip data obtained from experiments to model the variations in slip velocity as Gaussian distributions. This leads to a family of models that are switched depending on the input command. To obtain the wheel-slip measurements, experiments are conducted on a wheeled mobile robot and the measurements thus obtained are used to build the Gaussian models. Then the localization and mapping algorithm is tested on an experimental terrain and a new metric called the map spread factor is used to evaluate the ability of the slip compensation technique. Our results clearly indicate that the proposed methodology improves the accuracy by 72.55% for rotation and 66.67% for translation motion as against an uncompensated mapping system. The proposed compensation technique eliminates the need for extro receptive sensors for slip compensation, complex feature extraction and association algorithms. As a result, we obtain a simple slip compensation scheme for localization and mapping.},

abstract={Background aims: Skin keratinocytes (SKs) share the same surface ectodermal origin as that of corneal epithelium. In this study, the plasticity of epidermal keratinocytes was exploited to generate corneal epithelial-like cells, which might serve as an alternative source of autologous tissue for the treatment of bilateral limbal stem cell deficiency. Methods: Skin samples were subjected to collagenase digestion to isolate SKs and transdifferentiated to corneal epithelial-like cells using limbal fibroblast conditioned medium (LFCM). SKs and transdifferentiated corneal epithelial cells (TDCECs) were characterized using immunofluorescence and fluorescence-activated cell sorting. The propensity for expression of angiogenic genes in TDCECs was compared with cultured oral mucosal epithelial cells (COMEC) in vitro. RT2 quantitative polymerase chain reaction profiler array was performed to study the signaling pathways involved in the transdifferentiation process. Results: The TDCECs obtained from SKs showed corneal epithelial-like morphology and expressed corneal epithelial markers, CK3 and CK12. Hematoxylin-eosin and immunohistochemistry showed stratified layers of TDCECs expressing CK 3/12, confirming the corneal epithelial phenotype. We found that the expression of several angiogenic and epithelial mesenchymal transition factors were down-regulated in TDCECs compared with COMEC, suggesting a lower capacity to induce angiogenesis in TDCECs. There was considerable difference in the signaling mechanisms between TDCECs and SKs on testing by RT2 profiler array, signifying differences at the global gene profile. The comparison of TDCECs and limbal derived corneal epithelial cells showed similar gene expression. Discussion: Our study shows that SKs have the potential to transdifferentiate into corneal epithelial-like cells using LFCM. © 2016 International Society for Cellular Therapy.},

abstract={The SWING (Short Wave critical Infrastructure Network based on a new Generation high survival radio communication system) is a European project aimed at studying a high survival high-frequency (HF) radio network to link European Critical Infrastructures (ECIs). This system is thought to replace broadband internet communication, maintaining the minimum flux of essential information for the ECIs management and control, in case of wide-scale threats, including terrorist attacks, able to put out of order internet links over the Mediterranean region. SWING is designed to evaluate the threat and increase the security awareness, as well as the level of protection, of analogous and/or interdependent ECIs. In order to meet these goals, SWING was finalized to recognize how and when the internet communication fails and to develop the standard software and hardware tools necessary for implementing communication protocols suited for a reliable and interoperable short-wave (SW) or high-frequency (HF) radio network backup. The internet broadband description and internet failure recognition were taken into consideration in the project but are not treated in this paper. It has been assessed that in case of complete failure of the internet broadband communication fundamental information for the management and control of ECIs over the Mediterranean region can be maintained with a HF network, even in case of moderate ionospheric perturbations. ©2016.

abstract={Under a restructuring atmosphere, energy customers and producers generally create various bilateral real power markets. The transmission company usually carries out these bilateral power markets contained by the restrictions allowed through the power network design and working situation. The market operator can misuse the “power markets” and earn additional revenue. Flexible Alternate Current Transmission System devices are considered to be one such technology that helps in improving the bilateral real power markets. In this work, a new methodology for correct placement of Flexible Alternate Current Transmission System devices in the restructured power markets is proposed. A generalized evolutionary programming technique is projected to find out the optimal bilateral real power markets with and without Flexible Alternate Current Transmission System devices under a restructuring atmosphere. Flexible Alternate Current Transmission System devices, such as the Thyristor-Controlled Series Compensator, Static VAR Compensator, and Unified Power Flow Controller, are employed. Utilization of these devices helps in minimizing the cost and also helps in reducing the total overloads, excess power flow, and severity of overloading. A sample 4-bus system and 24-bus extra high-voltage Indian system are presented as examples to exemplify the use of this formulation to reduce the price of the bilateral power market. © 2016, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={We report a density-functional study on monomeric chromium oxide cluster: The maximum coordination number of the CrOn cluster was eight. The computed fragmentation energies for the various dissociation channels of oxygen, shows that oxo releases in these monomeric clusters are less likely to occur compared to the dioxygen and ozonide release. We have observed the existence of neutral CrOn clusters with n < 4 to have superhalogen behavior with vertical electron affinity values above 4.00 eV. The computed electrophilicity of the neutral clusters are found to decrease with the increase in cluster size and was found to obey the maximum hardness and minimum electrophilicity principle. The plotted electron localization function map supports the existence of ionic bonding between the Cr atom and oxygen ligands. The magnetic moments of the Cr atom are quenched by the opposite spin density of oxygen atom. © 2016 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract={Aims Breast cancer is highly resistant to chemotherapeutic approach and hence, alternative strategies have been developed to fight against this heterogeneous group of disease. In particular, many studies have demonstrated about various drugs for the treatment of breast cancer. In our study, we assessed the anti-angiogenenic activities of Bisindole-PBD (5b) in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines. Main methods In vitro Endothelial Cell (HUVEC) Tube Formation Assay was performed to show inhibitory role of 5b along with its role upon wound healing process in breast cancer cells in vitro. Semi-quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was also done to examine the expression of VEGF in response to 5b in breast cancer cells and in HUVEC cells. siRNA transfection study explored STAT3 mediated VEGF transcription in breast cancer cells MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231. CAM assay was performed to see the role of 5b on vessel formation in chicken embryo. Key findings From in vitro data we have demonstrated that 5b played a role in regulation of breast cancer cell proliferation by inhibiting angiogenesis. Test drug 5b suppressed the expression VEGF at both transcriptional and post transcriptional levels. Apart from this, there was significant down regulation in STAT3 level after drug treatment, which was found to be involved in the VEGF transcription. Metastasis related MMP-2 and MMP-9 expressions were also modulated by 5b. In vivo study by Chick Chorioallantoic Membrane (CAM) Assay also showed anti-angiogenesis role of the test drug which was consistent with the in vitro data. Significance Altogether, our data demonstrated 5b as potent small molecule with anti-angiogenic activities. © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In the current study, an artificial neural network (ANN)-based breast cancer prediction model was developed from the data of folate and xenobiotic pathway genetic polymorphisms along with the nutritional and demographic variables to investigate how micronutrients modulate susceptibility to breast cancer. The developed ANN model explained 94.2% variability in breast cancer prediction. Fixed effect models of folate (400 μg/day) and B12 (6 μg/day) showed 33.3% and 11.3% risk reduction, respectively. Multifactor dimensionality reduction analysis showed the following interactions in responders to folate: RFC1 G80A × MTHFR C677T (primary), COMT H108L × CYP1A1 m2 (secondary), MTR A2756G (tertiary). The interactions among responders to B12 were RFC1G80A × cSHMT C1420T and CYP1A1 m2 × CYP1A1 m4. ANN simulations revealed that increased folate might restore ER and PR expression and reduce the promoter CpG island methylation of extra cellular superoxide dismutase and BRCA1. Dietary intake of folate appears to confer protection against breast cancer through its modulating effects on ER and PR expression and methylation of EC-SOD and BRCA1. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Metal-oxide heterostructures are very important materials for developing various toxic gas/chemical detection sensor systems. However, the major factors, such as sensitivity, selectivity, stability, response, and recovery times of the sensors, still need to be optimized for practical technological applications. Low-dimensional materials have shown tremendous potential to solve majority of the critical issues due to their surface chemistry than that of their bulk form. In this paper, the role of nanostructured n-ZnO/p-NiO heterostructure as room temperature (RT) ammonia sensor has been investigated. Toward this paper, the electrospinning method was employed to prepare heterostructure metal-oxides blended with polyvinyl alcohol (n-ZnO/p-NiO) nanofibers. The systematic characterizations of the obtained n-ZnO/p-NiO heterostructure were performed using X-Ray diffractometer, scanning electron microscope, and photoluminescence spectrophotometer. Furthermore, the RT ammonia sensing characteristics were investigated. © 2016 IEEE.},

The electro deposition parameters such as current density, pH of bath, bath temperature, Al particles concentration in the bath and agitation speed were considered for this study. Nickel matrix / aluminum particle composite coatings were prepared from a Watt’s bath by electro-codeposition method. The Taguchi method was used to establish the relationship between the process parameter and response variable, micro hardness of the coated plate. L27 Taguchi orthogonal design was employed for conducting the experiments. The micro-hardness of the deposits was examined using a Vickers micro-hardness tester with the payload of 100 g for 10 sec of indentation period. Signal-to-noise ratio and analysis of variance were employed to determine the significance of the process parameter. The surface morphologies of coating and vol. % of Al particles in deposits were analyzed using optical and scanning electron microscope observations. © 2016, Sociedade Portuguesa de Electroquimica.

abstract={Gallium oxide thin films were deposited onto the quartz substrate by chemical spray pyrolysis technique. The effect of annealing over the structural, morphological, optical and electrical properties of Ga2O3thin films was studied. It was found that annealed Ga2O3thin film had polycrystalline nature with β-phase. Atomic force micrograph displayed formation of spherical particles over the film surface. A water contact angle study revealed that the annealed film had a hydrophobic nature due to its high surface roughness. Annealed films had high optical transparency (&gt;90%) in visible region and estimated band gap was 4.66 eV. Other optical parameters namely extinction co-efficient, refractive index and dielectric constant were estimated and discussed for both as-deposited and annealed films. The annealed film had less electrical resistivity when compared to the asdeposited one. Moreover, Nyquist plot revealed that both crystallite and crystallite boundary effect are equally influenced the AC impedance characteristics of annealed β-Ga2O3thin film. © 2016 American Scientific Publishers.

abstract={Hybrid Wind-solar stand-alone renewable energy systems is consider as more economical and reliable one than the stand-alone system with the single sources of wind and solar. Two different requirements storage capacity systems has been calculated in Hybrid system. The first main requirement of the storage capacity for supplying the Real and Reactive Power when there is no availability of solar energy and wind Resources. The second Main Requirement of the storage capacity which is used to supplying Reactive power only to the induction Generator when there is no availability of solar power. The calculations of storage capacity under different condition could satisfying the constraint for maintaining the Zero Loss of power supply probability (LPSP) and for improving the life of the battery bank system. A renewable resource such as the solar wind etc. offers clean, abundant energy. However, if, the Demand of power increases the Power failures gets increased so the renewable energy can be used to provide the constant Loads. Maximum power point tracking (MPPT) controller is necessary for ensuring the output of PV power generating systems at the maximum output power as possible. Distributed Generators based on Wind and Solar Requires a New Power electronics interface and controlling strategy for improving the efficiency and quality of Power in Hybrid systems. Distributed Generator system based on Single Source has been considered unreliable due to the harmonizing nature of the resources. PMSGs is commonly employed in such Hybrid schemes where they might not require reactive power support. Where areas PMSGs to be directly driven with wind-turbine system which avoids a gear box arrangement and do not require any maintenance. Permanent magnet synchronous generator has been received much attention because of its self-excited property which might leads to high power factor and high efficiency. © 2006-2016 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).},

Hence it was proposed to design NoC without buffers to save the packets. These are called bufferless NoC. Though bufferless NoC consumes less power and area than the conventional NoC the performance is drastically reduced due to deflection routing.

abstract={Epilepsy is a neurological disorder which is characterized by repeated seizures. Although these can be recorded using Electroencephalogram (EEG), it is very difficult task to classify the different states such as normal, preictal and ictal by visual inspection due to the non-linear and non stationary property of the EEG signals and also due to its long term recordings. Thus automatic detection of these states using various techniques has been in the literature for a very long time. We used novel features such as permutation entropy (PE), Tsallis entropy (TsE), and Kolmogorov complexity (KC) along with five different classifiers. We achieved a highest accuracy of 89.33% with Decision tree classifier. Our method being very simple and has fast computation time in comparison with other features in the literature and thus can form as a software tool that can be installed easily and also opens future opportunities towards real time detection and prediction of epileptic seizures. © Copyright 2016 American Scientific Publishers.

abstract={The workspace is often a critical parameter for optimum design of parallel manipulators. Workspace shape and area are two important considerations under this. In this paper, 5-R and 3-RRR planar parallel manipulators having symmetric link lengths are considered for workspace analysis. Here, symmetric means that the lengths of the first and second links of the legs are the same in all branches. Workspace analysis for such manipulators is normally done in a nondimensional way. The determination of the workspace area is one of the important parameters in the optimum design of a manipulator, and the determination of the area in terms of nondimensional parameters is extremely difficult in the case of 3-DOF and higher-DOF manipulators. In this paper, a geometric method is presented to determine different workspace shapes and areas. Based on this, all possible shapes of workspace are presented for both 5-R and 3-RRR planar parallel manipulators. For each case, a geometrical relationship between the link lengths is determined. The geometric approach gives a closed-form expression for the area calculation, which is not possible when adopting a nondimensional approach. In addition, this approach provides relationships between workspace shape and area and link lengths. Copyright © Cambridge University Press 2014.},

abstract={In this study, we employed a two-step protocol to fine tune the enzymatic activity of the keratinase isolated from a mutant strain of Streptomyces sp. IF5. First, we identified physical factors (like temperature, pH) required for optimal enzymatic activity (through onefactor- at-a-time method, OFAT) at treatment stage and coupled these results with response surface methodology (RSM) using central composite design (CCD) to determine their mid-values. Through OFAT, we arrived at parameter ranges such as temperature (30-70°C), pH (4-13) and calcium salt concentration (25 to 75 mM). In RSM, we included substrate concentration, inoculum size, pH (for production of enzyme) alongside Ca2+ ion concentration, temperature (and pH of borate buffer for activity) and simulated response patterns through a 20 fullfactorial rotatable CCD. The optimized variables were 1% substrate concentration, 5% inoculum size, pH 12.0 (for production), 75mM Ca2+, pH 8.0 and 40°C (for enzyme activity). Employing these variables in production media followed by purification of crude extract with DEAE-Sephadex-A50 column, specific enzyme activity was estimated at 17.168 U/mg of keratin and the purified enzyme had a molecular weight of 7sim;66 kDa.},

The strain subjected to different culture conditions for production of extrolites were extracted using ethyl acetate and chloroform. When both extracts were subjected for antibacterial activity, latter had high activity. Minimum inhibitory concentration of chloroform extract ranged from 31.25-1000 μg/mL in tested microbes such as, Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra, Mycobacterium avium, Mycobacterium fortuitum, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Mycobacterium vaccae, Staphylococcus aureus, Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Vibrio cholerae. No cytotoxicity was observed in Vero cell line up to 399.10 μg/mL. Antibacterial activity previously reported by Parameswaran et al. in 1997 from ethyl acetate extract of T. anhelans might be due to the diketopiperazines, Cyclo-(l-Pro-l-Phe) and Cyclo-(l-Leu-l-Pro) produced by the associated fungi-P. chrysogenum DSOA.

abstract={Dermoscopy is a technique used to capture the images of skin, and these images are useful to analyze the different types of skin diseases. Malignant melanoma is a kind of skin cancer whose severity even leads to death. Earlier detection of melanoma prevents death and the clinicians can treat the patients to increase the chances of survival. Only few machine learning algorithms are developed to detect the melanoma using its features. This paper proposes a Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system which equips efficient algorithms to classify and predict the melanoma. Enhancement of the images are done using Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization technique (CLAHE) and median filter. A new segmentation algorithm called Normalized Otsu’s Segmentation (NOS) is implemented to segment the affected skin lesion from the normal skin, which overcomes the problem of variable illumination. Fifteen features are derived and extracted from the segmented images are fed into the proposed classification techniques like Deep Learning based Neural Networks and Hybrid Adaboost-Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. The proposed system is tested and validated with nearly 992 images (malignant & benign lesions) and it provides a high classification accuracy of 93 %. The proposed CAD system can assist the dermatologists to confirm the decision of the diagnosis and to avoid excisional biopsies. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={An increase of putrescine content in tiger prawn can be related to the deterioration of its quality. Increase in putrescine consumption causes nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, allergy, and flushing in humans. To address this issue, a glassy carbon electrode modified with diamine oxidase on ceria nanoparticles was fabricated for rapid determination of putrescine in tiger prawn. Based on the amperometric response, calibrated models such as linear, Hill, and Michaelis–Menten functions were constructed. The best performing model was based on Hill analysis, yielding relative prediction error of 0.035, percentage recovery of 113.10, and root mean square error of cross validation of 0.083. All the three models were verified with extract of tiger prawn sample. Among the three models, only the amperometric biosensor based on Hill analysis showed acceptable recovery with low relative standard deviation in tiger prawn sample. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Thermodynamically stable α-MoO3 nanoplates were synthesized using organic aliphatic acids as structure controlling agents and investigated photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB) and rhodamine blue (Rh-B) in presence of sun light. Three different organic aliphatic acids, citric acid (CA), tartaric acid (TA) and ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA), were employed to control morphologies. CA and TA predominantly produced extended hexagonal plates where EDTA gave nanorods as well as nanoplates. PXRD studies confirmed the formation of α-MoO3 nanoparticles. HR-TEM and FE-SEM reveal the formation of plate morphologies with 20-40 nm thickness, 50-100 nm diameter and 600 nm lengths. The different morphologies of α-MoO3 nanoparticles lead to the tunable optical band gap between 2.80 and 2.98 eV which was obtained from diffused reflectance spectra (DRS). Interestingly, the synthesized α-MoO3 nanoplates exhibited strong photocatalytic degradation of MB and Rh-B up to 99% in presence of sun light without using any oxidizing agents. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={The effect of varying concentrations (0 to 100 vol pct) of glycol polymer solution on wetting kinetics, kinematics, and cooling performance during immersion quenching was studied by using goniometry, online video imaging, and cooling curve analysis techniques. An increase in concentration of the polymer solution resulted in improved wettability and accelerated spreading kinetics of the quench medium. The quench medium showed medium-fast-nonuniform, fast-uniform, slow-uniform, explosive/rapid, repeated, and slow-nonuniform rewetting phenomena depending on the concentration of the polymer solution. The collapse of the vapor film was by an instantaneous rupture process in the quench medium containing more water and by nucleation of bubbles caused by the selective rupture process in the quench medium enriched with polymer. The quench medium consisting of an equal amount of water and polymer showed an explosive collapse of the vapor film on the quench probe surface. The nature of the wetting front was uniform with polymer quench media except at 100 vol pct concentration of polymer quenchant. There was enhancement in the cooling performance of the quench medium, which was enhanced for a lower volume concentration of the polymer solution. However, an increase in the concentration of the polymer resulted in a decreased cooling performance. The cooling of the probe was more uniform with polymer quenchants (5 to 25 vol pct), which exhibited fast and uniform rewetting. Polymer quenchants (75 to 100 vol pct) that exhibited repeated and slow-nonuniform rewetting showed large variation in heat transfer over the quench probe surface. © 2015, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society and ASM International.},

abstract={Dengue cases were reported to undergo platelet activation and thrombocytopenia by a poorly understood mechanism. Recent studies suggested that Carica papaya leaf extract could recover the platelet count in dengue cases. However, no studies have attempted to unravel the mechanism of the plant extract in platelet recovery. Since there are no available drugs to treat dengue and considering the significance of C. papaya in dengue treatment, the current study aimed to evaluate two research questions: First one is to study if the C. papaya leaf extract exerts its action directly on platelets and second one is to understand if the extract can specifically inhibit the platelet aggregation during dengue viral infection. Sixty subjects with dengue positive and 60 healthy subjects were recruited in the study. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and platelet-poor plasma were prepared from both the dengue-infected and healthy control blood samples. Effect of the leaf extract obtained from C. papaya leaves was assessed on plasma obtained as well as platelets collected from both healthy and dengue-infected individuals. Platelet aggregation was significantly reduced when leaf extract preincubated with dengue plasma was added into control PRP, whereas no change in aggregation when leaf extract incubated-control plasma was added into control PRP. Upon direct addition of C. papaya leaf extract, both dengue PRP and control PRP showed a significant reduction in platelet aggregation. Within the dengue group, PRP from severe and nonsevere cases showed a significant decrease in aggregation without any difference between them. From the study, it is evident that C. papaya leaf extract can directly act on platelet. The present study, the first of its kind, found that the leaf extract possesses a dengue-specific neutralizing effect on dengue viral-infected plasma that may exert a protective role on platelets. © Copyright 2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016.},

abstract={This paper presents an authentication of a user based on gesture recognition algorithm using accelerometer. It is very challenging task to recognize user action and reaction corresponding to that in real time by designing a dynamic gesture interface system. Physical movements of face, fingers, hands or body with respect to environment action is referred as Gesture. For applications like sign language, virtual reality and remote control gestural interfaces are developed using gesture recognition and motion tracking techniques. In this paper, we are designing a hardware module consisting of a tri-axial accelerometer and microcontroller transmission module to sense the hand gesture and collect the same. User can use this hardware module to draw any kind of gesture. Personal computer receives the hand motions transmitted by the transmitter that is connected to accelerometer. Using the proposed algorithm we are able to authenticate the user effectively. For continuous reaction gesture is recognized and estimates variations in gestures in our module. Our work has been found to provide better accuracy and validation result compared to existing works. © 2016, Research India Publications.},

abstract={This paper focuses on efficient techniques based on AdaBoost and its hybrid (AdaBoost-SVM) classifiers for an automatic detection of the erythemato-squamous diseases (ESD). The classification of ESD requires an enormous amount of computational effort, as all the features of the diseases have more than 90 % commonality. Some of the approaches reported in literature are fuzzy logic, artificial neural networks, neuro-fuzzy models and support vector machine. Recently, AdaBoost and its hybrid algorithms are widely used to enhance the accuracy of the learning algorithms. In this paper, we propose AdaBoost and its hybrid algorithms for diagnosis of erythemato-squamous diseases for the first time. User-friendly-interface is designed to assist dermatologists to estimate the ESD with the help of 34 features includes patient’s histopathological and clinical data sets. Efficient interface design is based on the following steps: (1) feature selection for all the 34 parameters involved in the erythemato-squamous disease is done using association rule based Apriori algorithm, (2) association rules are used to find (Formula presented.) of transactions (diseases) to meet (Formula presented.) of the features of the diseases, (3) support value of all the subset of (Formula presented.) transaction from (Formula presented.) of transactions is found and the dominant subset is found using Apriori algorithm, and (4) AdaBoost and its hybrid classifiers are used to classify the diseases. In this paper, the real, modest, gentle and hybrid AdaBoost algorithms are implemented and tested with the dataset of 366 patients. The data preprocessing reduces the dimensionality of the dataset and improves the time complexity of the estimation of the diseases. Proposed methodologies are proved as a potential solution for diagnosing ESD with significant improvement in computational time and accuracy compared to other models discussed in the recent literature. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={The binding mode of a conformationally locked NC(O)N planar system with deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is investigated using various spectroscopic and enzymatic assays. Compound 1 and its four different salts (comp. 2-5) were prepared for this purpose. They showed certain changes in their respective DNA-compound complex at ground state and excited state as measured by UV-vis and fluorescence emission spectra. The Stern-Volmer quenching constant (KSV) for the neutral species (1) is found 8545M-1, whereas, for its salts 2, 3, 4 and 5 the quenching constants were 33510M-1, 11352M-1, 19693M-1 and 27270M-1 respectively. Nevertheless, the binding constant values remain comparable in neutral and salt forms except for 5. To elucidate the reason we took their CD spectra and ran a topoisomerase I (Topo I) assay. These experimental data revel the fact that compound 1 (neutral form) binds at the minor groove of DNA, whereas, its salt (2) has an extended intercalating property. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={We experimentally demonstrate that a processing delay, a finite response time, in the coupling can revoke the stability of the stable steady states, thereby facilitating the revival of oscillations in the same parameter space where the coupled oscillators suffered the quenching of oscillation. This phenomenon of reviving of oscillations is demonstrated using two different prototype electronic circuits. Further, the analytical critical curves corroborate that the spread of the parameter space with stable steady state is diminished continuously by increasing the processing delay. Finally, the death state is completely wiped off above a threshold value by switching the stability of the stable steady state to retrieve sustained oscillations in the same parameter space. The underlying dynamical mechanism responsible for the decrease in the spread of the stable steady states and the eventual reviving of oscillation as a function of the processing delay is explained using analytical results. © 2016.},

abstract={Highly selective colorimetric sensing of Hg2+ ions have been demonstrated in aqueous medium across wide pH range (2.0-10.0) using AuNPs without any specific surface functionality or size and morphological control. AuNPs stabilized with different capping agents such as PEG, PSS, T-80, PVA, SDS, PVP were synthesized using ascorbic acid reducing agent and characterized by absorption spectroscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM). Interestingly, Hg2+ addition into AuNPs exhibited highly selective colour and absorption change. The controlled studies indicate that ascorbic acid might play a significant role by converting Hg2+ to metallic Hg that promotes amalgamation with AuNPs. The concentration dependent studies indicate that the synthesized AuNPs can detect Hg2+ ions up to ppb (10-9 M) level. Importantly, T-80- and PSS-AuNPs showed selective sensing of Hg2+ across wide pH range (2.0-10.0). The recovery and interference studies demonstrate the good selectivity of AuNPs for Hg2+ ions in presence of other metal cations. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Controlled and precise delivery of fluid is one of the essential requirement in many fluid flow applications such as micro fluidics, Micro Electro Mechanical Systems, micro-machining and in medicinal biological systems. Such deliveries are commonly achieved using syringe pump which generally employs syringes driven by an electric motor. In this work a syringe pump is operated with a Raspberry Pi - System on Single Chip, which is more user friendly than a control with an ordinary microcontroller. It runs on Linux platform which is easy to code and control using Python language. The syringe pump is actuated by stepper motor which has 200 steps per revolution so that precise flow rate is possible compared to other electrical actuators. The stepper is connected to a Dual H-Bridge L293D motor driver, which in turn is powered through the GPIO (General Purpose Input / Output) pins - an integral part of the Raspberry pi. Lead screw mechanism is used in this work to transmit rotary motion of the motor to linear motion of syringe. The pitch length travelled by the screw is minimal and controllable, resulting in a precise flow rate of the fluid which is measured experimentally. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Cryptococcal meningitis caused by Cryptococcus neoformans, is a common opportunistic neural infection in immunocompromised individuals. Cryptococcus meningitis is associated with fungal burden with larger capsule size in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). To understand the role of CSF constituents in capsule enlargement, we have evaluated the effect of artificial CSF on capsule induction in comparison with various other capsule inducing media. Two different strains of C. neoformans, an environmental and a clinical isolates were used in the present study. While comparing the various capsule inducing media for the two different strains of C. neoformans, it was observed that the capsule growth was significantly increased when grown in artificial CSF at pH 5.5, temperature 34°C for ATCC C. neoformans and 37°C for Clinical C. neoformans and with an incubation period of 72 h. In addition, artificial CSF supports biofilm formation in C. neoformans. While investigating the individual components of artificial CSF, we found that Mg2+ ions influence the capsule growth in both environmental and clinical strains of C. neoformans. To confirm our results we studied the expression of four major CAP genes namely, CAP10, CAP59, CAP60, and CAP64 in various capsule inducing media and in different concentrations of Mg2+ and Ca2+. Our results on gene expression suggest that, Mg2+ does have an effect on CAP gene expression, which are important for capsule biosynthesis and virulence. Our findings on the role of Mg2+ ion as a signal for capsule induction will promote a way to elucidate the control mechanisms for capsule biosynthesis in C. neoformans. © 2016 Rathore, Raman and Ramakrishnan.},

abstract={Vertical sounding is a widely used technique to obtain ionosphere measurements, such as an estimation of virtual height versus frequency scanning. It is performed by high frequency radar for geophysical applications called "ionospheric sounder" (or "ionosonde"). Radar detection depends mainly on targets characteristics. While several targets behavior and correspondent echo detection algorithms have been studied, a survey to address a suitable algorithm for ionospheric sounder has to be carried out. This paper is focused on automatic echo detection algorithms implemented in particular for an ionospheric sounder, target specific characteristics were studied as well. Adaptive threshold detection algorithms are proposed, compared to the current implemented algorithm, and tested using actual data obtained from the Advanced Ionospheric Sounder (AIS-INGV) at Rome Ionospheric Observatory.

abstract={To date, much effort has been expended on making high-performance microscopes through better instrumentation. Recently, it was discovered that physical magnification of specimens was possible, through a technique called expansion microscopy (ExM), raising the question of whether physical magnification, coupled to inexpensive optics, could together match the performance of high-end optical equipment, at a tiny fraction of the price. Here we show that such "hybrid microscopy" methods - combining physical and optical magnifications - can indeed achieve high performance at low cost. By physically magnifying objects, then imaging them on cheap miniature fluorescence microscopes ("mini-microscopes"), it is possible to image at a resolution comparable to that previously attainable only with benchtop microscopes that present costs orders of magnitude higher. We believe that this unprecedented hybrid technology that combines expansion microscopy, based on physical magnification, and mini-microscopy, relying on conventional optics - a process we refer to as Expansion Mini-Microscopy (ExMM) - is a highly promising alternative method for performing cost-effective, high-resolution imaging of biological samples. With further advancement of the technology, we believe that ExMM will find widespread applications for high-resolution imaging particularly in research and healthcare scenarios in undeveloped countries or remote places.},

abstract={Cow milk contains carbohydrates that are prone to produce methylglyoxal (MG) which plays a major role in chronic complications of diabetes. In this context, an electrochemical biosensor based on a glyoxalase 1 (GLO 1) modified platinum electrode (Pt) with a ceria nano-interface (CeO2) was developed. The fabricated Pt/CeO2/GLO 1/chitosan nano-bioelectrode reduced MG and hemithioacetal at -0.771 and -0.558 V respectively in the presence of glutathione (GSH). Michaelis-Menten and Hill models were employed for the estimation of the response time. The accuracy of these models was validated by calculating the relative prediction error. The modified Hill model showed the best results in validation. The sensitivity of the Pt/CeO2/GLO 1/chitosan nano-bioelectrode at -0.771 V was 2.868 μA μM-1 over a linear range between 5 and 50 μM, with a detection limit of 2.14 nM, a quantification limit of 7.12 nM and a response time of less than 39 s. The fabricated electrode was demonstrated to be highly reproducible with a relative standard deviation of 1.02% over 10 successive amperometric calibrations. It also showed good recovery (99.21-101.72%), thus providing a promising tool for the analysis of MG in cow milk. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.},

abstract={Purpose - This paper aims to study the comparison between a response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial neural network (ANN) in the modelling and prediction of surface roughness during endmilling of glass-fibre-reinforced polymer composites. Design/methodology/approach - Aiming to achieve this goal, several milling experiments were performed with polycrystalline diamond inserts at different machining parameters, namely, feed rate, cutting speed, depth of cut and fibre orientation angle. Mathematical model is created using central composite face-centred second-order in RSM and the adequacy of the model was verified using analysis of variance. ANN model is created using the back propagation algorithm. Findings - With regard to the machining test, it was observed that feed rate is the dominant parameter that affects the surface roughness, followed by the fibre orientation. The comparison results show that models provide accurate prediction of surface roughness in which ANN performs better than RSM. Originality/value - The data predicted from ANN are very nearer to experimental results compared to RSM; therefore, this ANN model can be used to determine the surface roughness for various fibre-reinforced polymer composites and also for various machining parameters. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The most essential part of healthy human being is pure drinking water. Also, most of the diseases are spreading because of the consumption of contaminated water so there is a need for water quality monitoring systems. The method involved for water quality assessment at present involves collections of water samples approach is not much efficient. It is because there lie various drawbacks such as long time consumption and water samples only from few areas. Also, it requires enough man power. Hence, this method cannot provide critical decision for public health protection. This paper presents an approach to determine the quality of water by using low cost sensors. The implementation cost for this system is reduced as is reported immediately by sending SMS in case of contamination. Here an array of sensors is used to monitor the quality of water. The information collected by the sensors is processed using microcontroller (AT89S52) and transmitted to the main server through ZigBee transmitter. Further, in case any contamination is detected, SMS will be sent to the registered mobile phones by using GSM. © 2016 Pushpa Publishing House, Allahabad, India.},

abstract={Information security plays a pivotal role in every domain related to exchange of information. There is always a demand for simple and stronger encryption methods. Copious numbers of encryption algorithms are currently existent and have been achieving data security to a great extent. But, as the level of security increases, the complexity of algorithm also increases. This results in reduction in speed and requires more CPU cycles for processing. Striking a balance between the level of security and speed of processing is always important. A new encryption algorithm has been proposed in this paper "AB2IG-ASCII Binary 2's complement Invert Gray" which provides simple yet enhanced security, thereby offering higher speed of the encryption.

abstract={Due to the swift progress in wireless devices and their use, the previous decade has proved to be illustrious towards wireless broadcasting spectrum. The concept of cognitive radio (CR) is projected to tackle the problem of spectrum competence. The unremitting development of wireless communications, particularly mobile networks creates usable spectrum increasingly precious. The capacity to use both licensed and unlicensed inactive spectrums would result in incredible cost savings or incremental profits. In this paper, we propose a simulink based model to sense the spectrum by using fundamental power finding method. We analyze the channel residence by evaluating the received signal strength with a known threshold rate. If the signal is modulated (analog or digital), energy level will be very high when compared to the average noise signal, from which we can conclude that channel is occupied by some primary users else it is at leisure. We perform this for various analog and digital modulations among the variety of channels like additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), Rayleigh and Rician and compare the bit error rate (BER). © 2016 Pushpa Publishing House, Allahabad, India.},

Similarly, when the load driven by the main grid is less, there is an over frequency in the system. This paper reports a case study on isolated island system. When the secondary generation is less than the demand (power required driving the load), there is an abrupt change in the frequency of the system. Hence, to affirmation the frequency, more staunch techniques require for these systems. This can be overcome by using a FUZZY logic load shedding scheme by MATLAB fuzzy toolbox. Load shedding can be achieved by using pre-fetched information feed into a FUZZY system and load balancing can be done by the use of capacitance bank. © 2016 Pushpa Publishing House, Allahabad, India.},

abstract={The growth of internet applications makes the intrusions on the networking system at a high level. In such a situation, it is essential to offer security to the network systems by an efficient intrusion detection and avoidance mechanisms (IDS and IPS). This can be accomplished by formulating an efficient intrusion detecting system that finds effective attributes of the IDS dataset and can distinguish the abnormal and normal activities in the network. Many intrusion detection system applications have been proposed in the past and the systems are having limitations in terms of detection accuracy. To overcome these limitations, the proposed research work offers a new scheme of identifying the suitable attributes for the IDS by prediction mechanisms such as Bayesian classification and support vector machine. The experiments are conducted using KDD CUP'99 dataset and the observation shows that the proposed approach reduces false positive alarms, detects suitable attributes for the intrusion detection, precisely and accurately. Hence, the overall accuracy detection has been improved. © 2016 Pushpa Publishing House, Allahabad, India.},

abstract={The paper presents a proficient lossless image enciphering scheme Impede Pitching Connive (IPC) mechanism. The execution pattern of the proposed method creates non-overlapping image blocks from the secret image. The blocks are then subjected to IPC practice, which would generate the cipher image. The cipher image is then transmitted over the network channel. The receiver needs to apply the Inverse IPC to obtain the original image. The major benefit of such a proposed scheme is its lossless decomposition, efficiency and portability. Both experiments and analysis show the proposed scheme produces a proficient cipher image, which defy the standard cipher attacks. The potency of the projected scheme proves that it is suitable for image applications. © 2016 Pushpa Publishing House, Allahabad, India.},

abstract={Ethanol is an important renewable biofuel which can be used in pure or blended form. Corncob is a residual waste from corn processing unit, is a cheap and abundant raw material which can be used for ethanol production. Due to the high content of cellulose corncob needed to be pretreatment in order to convert corncob to reducing sugar. Corncob was pretreatment in the alkali condition and hydrolysed with cellulases extracted from Aspergillus Niger. A central composite design was adopted to determine the optimum levels of these factors. Sodium hydroxide solution by varying the factors such as sonication time (3-5 hrs), Temperature (40-80 C), and NaOH concentration (3-6 %). The product of hydrolysis was fermented using the bakers yeast to ethanol. The GCMS Analysis proves that the corncob is an efficient source for the production of ethanol with 96.214% pure.},

abstract={In the fast growing world understanding a situation is highly dynamic process. The decisions are to be made in an instantaneous fashion following different stages of risk and ambiguity. Project managers and leaders are forced to make such critical decisions that change the effect of the company. One such critical decision that involves rationalism and logical diagnosing is the process of choosing a feasible employee for a given project. The main objective of this research work is to propose strategies for optimally electing employees for an effective team formation and to understand the relationship between team's success and given project's success. The method adopted for achieving the central theme of the article is to develop a novel research model that wraps three dominant machine learning approaches to form a triangular hybridization for a better quality team formation. The three methods inspired are Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Decision Tree (DT), and a proposed method called Ensemble Decision Tree (EDT) which is a boosted decision tree using logit boost algorithm that are embedded into the proposed research model for achieving the desired goal. As a pilot scale attempt the model is validated by training and testing it over 474 freelancers from leading sites. The results infer that there exist a direct dependence of team and project success and the proposed EDT approach outperforms other two methods yielding an accuracy of about 87.34% in predicting the unknown sample as a valid or an invalid agent for the current project under consideration. © 2006-2016 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).},

In any firm every other resource surrounds the human resource thereby utilizing the resource for its full potential to deliver the right product at the right time. The main objective of this article is to investigate the relationship between communication and project success and to design novel techniques for formalizing person to person pairing based on interaction rates. A research model is constructed and a meta-heuristic Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) approach is deployed which is inspired by the biological behaviour of ants for achieving the goal. The proposed model is tested over a small scale design based start-up firm as a pilot scale attempt and results infer higher stability and reliability of the model. The result of this method is compared with the classical assignment model wrapped by Hungarian Method (HM). The comparative analysis infers that ACO approach is a perfect blend and choice for sequential continuous communication while HM is a better choice for discrete communication. This also infers that the communication is a key attribute for project success and there exists a direct relationship between the two paradigms success and interaction. © 2006-2016 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).},

India produces 40-70% of the World Health Organization (WHO) demand for Diphtheria-Pertussis-Tetanus and Bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccine and 90% of measles vaccine. Sustained by the amazing success achieved by consumer durables industry in the online space, pharma is the next big sector in India to target consumer online. The growth in the industry has created a great opportunity for the online model for this business. India has now seen pharma players taking the e-commerce route with an intention to offer a solution to a number of problems plaguing the retail pharmacy industry.

abstract={To comprehend whether corporate social responsibility (CSR) in pharma is more of a corporate hypocrisy where firms and organizations tend to marginalize their employees and the environment at large. The present study is case based, and an attempt has been made to analyze probable driving reasons behind the corporate behavior exhibited by pharma industries. CSR is understood differently by different beneficiaries but usually refers to serving the citizens, population of communities, and the larger society in a way that goes beyond what is legally required of a firm. Though numerous programs and schemes have been launched for their upliftment, it is all an eye wash which is intended for the internal benefit of the organization. Corporate these days, as per the Companies Act should report spend of 2% of their profits as pronounced in the CSR and pharmaceutical companies are no exemption to it. As per Section 135 of the Companies Act 2013, it is recommended that companies having revenue above Rs. 1,000 crore and profit more than Rs. 5 crore should report what they spend for CSR. Companies these days often utilize CSR as a brand building exercise, engagement of employees, helping the local community around their firm, or even as a fame generating spot for the themes of the chairman’s spouse. Thus, it is obvious that the social responsibility of pharmaceutical business sector is mainly to increase their profit, increase their shareholder activism, and investment in the community. © 2016, Asian Journal of Pharmaceutical and Clinical Research.

abstract={Textile effluents are characterized by high chemical oxygen demand, biological oxygen demand, total dissolved solids, pH and colour. Fabric preparation steps, such as desizing, scouring, bleaching and mercerizing, use various chemicals and plenty of water. The occurrence of unfixed dyes and other electrolytes in effluents poses serious threats to the environment. Available end-of-pipe treatment procedures are either expensive or not efficient; hence, a large number of small-scale industries succumb to this problem. So, finding an alternative eco-friendly process of textile production is of paramount interest. Here, we review three potential eco-friendly systems applicable to textile dyeing processes to minimize salt and water consumption. First, we review application of enzymatic processing in fabric preparation. Secondly, we review the use of biodegradable organic salts, such as trisodium citrate, magnesium acetate, tetrasodium edate and sodium salts of polycarboxylic acids, as fixation and exhaustion agents. Finally, we review various surface modifications of cotton to reduce the volume of effluent and total dissolved solids. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract={The expression of virulence genes in the human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus is strongly influenced by the multiple global regulators. The signal transduction cascade of these global regulators is accountable for recognizing and integrating the environmental cues to regulate the virulence regulon. While the production of virulent factors by individual global regulators are comparatively straightforward to define, auto-regulation of these global regulators and their impact on other regulators is more complex process. There are several reports on the production of virulent factors that are precisely regulated by switching processes of multiple global regulators including some prominent accessory regulators such as agr, sae and sar which allows S. aureus to coordinate the gene expression, and thus, provide organism an ability to act collectively. This review implicates the mechanisms involved in the global regulation of various virulence factors along with a comprehensive discussion on the differences between these signal transduction systems, their auto-induction and, coordination of classical and some comparatively new bacterial signal transduction systems. © 2015, Association of Microbiologists of India.},

abstract={Abstract: Combustion of pentachlorophenol (PCP) affects guar gum product results in the production of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), which affects fertility, immune system, thyroid hormone status of pregnant woman and nervous system. TCDD and PCP, the well-known potential carcinogens, can also cause environmental pollutions. In this context, an acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme-based electrochemical biosensor with ZnO nanointerface was developed for the detection of TCDD and PCP in guar gum samples. In order to model the combined cyclic voltammetric responses of TCDD and PCP, a set of nine mixtures were prepared. Quantitative analysis for TCDD and PCP in a mixture has been investigated using linear regression analysis and prediction performance of the different linear models was compared. The fabricated Pt/ZnO/AChE/chitosan bioelectrode showed a linear relationship over a concentration range of 1–20 nM (R 2  = 0.99) for TCDD and PCP with a low detection limit of 0.768 and 0.534 nM, respectively. Five sets of synthetic mixtures of TCDD and PCP in guar gum samples were analysed using the proposed linear methods and yielded satisfactory results.

abstract={Data gathering in wireless sensor networks (WSN) consumes more energy due to large amount of data transmitted. In direct transmission (DT) method, each node has to transmit its generated data to the base station (BS) which leads to higher energy consumption and affects the lifetime of the network. Clustering is one of the efficient ways of data gathering in WSN. There are various kinds of clustering techniques, which reduce the overall energy consumption in sensor networks. Cluster head (CH) plays a vital role in data gathering in clustered WSN. Energy consumption in CH node is comparatively higher than other non CH nodes because of its activities like data aggregation and transmission to BS node. The present day clustering algorithms in WSN use multi-hopping mechanism which cost higher energy for the CH nodes near to BS since it routes the data from other CHs to BS. Some CH nodes may die earlier than its intended lifetime due to its overloaded work which affects the performance of the WSN. This paper contributes a new clustering algorithm, Distributed Unequal Clustering using Fuzzy logic (DUCF) which elects CHs using fuzzy approach. DUCF forms unequal clusters to balance the energy consumption among the CHs. Fuzzy inference system (FIS) in DUCF uses the residual energy, node degree and distance to BS as input variables for CH election. Chance and size are the output fuzzy parameters in DUCF. DUCF assigns the maximum limit (size) of a number of member nodes for a CH by considering its input fuzzy parameters. The smaller cluster size is assigned for CHs which are nearer to BS since it acts as a router for other distant CHs. DUCF ensures load balancing among the clusters by varying the cluster size of its CH nodes. DUCF uses Mamdani method for fuzzy inference and Centroid method for defuzzification. DUCF performance was compared with well known algorithms such as LEACH, CHEF and EAUCF in various network scenarios. The experimental results indicated that DUCF forms unequal clusters which ensure load balancing among clusters, which again improves the network lifetime compared with its counterparts. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={In this paper, an artificial neural network (ANN) based one cycle control (OCC) strategy is proposed for the DSTATCOM shunted across the load in three phase four wire distribution system. The proposed control strategy mitigates harmonic/reactive currents, ensures balanced and sinusoidal source current from the supply mains that are nearly in phase with the supply voltage and compensates neutral current under varying source and load conditions. The proposed control strategy is superior over conventional methods as it eliminates, the sensors needed for sensing load current and coupling inductor current, in addition to the multipliers and the calculation of reference currents. ANN controllers are implemented to maintain voltage across the capacitor and as a compensator to compensate neutral current. The DSTATCOM performance is validated for all possible conditions of source and load by simulation using MATLAB software and simulation results prove the efficacy of the proposed control over conventional control strategy. © 2015 Faculty of Engineering, Ain Shams University.

abstract={Many methods have been taken to avoid accident by using drowsiness detection. Each technique has their own merits and demerits. The most practical approach to detect drowsiness was previously done by image processing techniques and by using eye blink patterns. These techniques had several drawbacks which led to the introduction of a new way of detecting drowsiness by using sensors. In the image processing technique, the driver is supposed to pick something on the floor. The moment he bends the system signal automatically alerts the user, since the user has moved away from his original position. Nowadays BCI has become popular for detecting drowsiness by capturing brain wave signals. Here, the detection is carried out by a wireless sensor which captures the brain waves and determines the drowsiness, even with eyes open. The sensor works in combination with BCI, which transmits the EEG waves to the system. During relaxation the sensor can also detect the meditation level. © 2016 Pushpa Publishing House, Allahabad, India.},

abstract={Welding is a major task for any component fabrication in every industry. Irrespective of the number of years of the science and art of welding, defects may continue to occur in its lifetime or during welding. The welds are expected to be tested and evaluated using codes of practice. Nowadays industries extensively used ultrasonic testing to detect and evaluate the defects/flaws in the weldments. Ultrasonic testing has extensive developments in the last two decades because of the advancement in sensor and signal analysis technologies. Time of flight diffraction is the advanced technique which has better probability of detection of linear defects. A major irritant during application of ToFD especially for the inspecting of austenitic stainless steel weldments is the presence of noises. Such noises have been reduced utilizing different approaches and each has its own merits and demerits. This paper focuses on the application of discrete wavelet transform (DWT) decompositions with lower-order wavelet filters for de-noising ultrasonic ToFD B-scan images. Analysis clearly indicates that this approach also gives greater SNR improvement with less computational time. © 2016 Pushpa Publishing House, Allahabad, India.},

abstract={The demand of delivering faster, smaller, and highly reliable integrated circuit chips is what drives the semiconductor market. The most crucial design parameter that requires ultimate attention is power consumption. In the chip design, it is very important to consider the factors of power dissipation, operating speed and area. In this paper, the dual stack flip flop circuit is designed in sleep transistor method, dynamic CMOS logic method and pass transistor logic (PTL). The dual stack technique is compared in terms of power area, frequency, dissipation, final voltage and maximum Idd current with sleep transistor method, dynamic logic and PTL logic. The proposed dual stack sleep transistor technique that has reduced leakage power, decreased area among the three logics.

abstract={Cassia occidentalis L. is an important member of plant family Fabaceae. C. occidentalis is known as ‘kasamarda’ and it has been mentioned in various nighandus viz. Rajnighantu, Dhanwantari, Bhavaprakasa, Rajballaba. It has active ingredients such as anthraquinones derivatives and their glycosides. C. occidentalis extract is used to cure eye inflammations in Ayurveda. It is also used in Jamaican folk medicines for curing diarrhoea, dysentery, constipation, fever, cancer, eczema and venereal diseases. Seeds of C. occidentalis are good source of alternative plant proteins, rich in vitamin B3 and also abundant in Ca, K, P, Na, Mg, Fe, Zn, Cu but low in Mo, Co, Se, S and F. The amino acid profile revealed a high concentration of leucine, histidine, proline and glycine. It is a main ingredient of Liv. 52. Herbolax, a polyherbal formulation that is commonly used in treating constipation. A new indigenous metabolic corrective for newborns and infants called ‘Bonnisan’ is also made up of C. occidentalis (0.5 mg/5 ml), which helps to bring immediate relief from discomfort caused by gastric wind. Pharmacological investigations have revealed several biological activities such as antioxidant, analgesic, antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, anti-malarial, anti-diabetic, anti-cancer and antidepressant activities of C. occidentalis. Detoxification of the seeds is essential through processing before its use in human/animal diet.

abstract={Ficoll is a neutral, highly branched polymer used as a molecular crowder in the study of proteins. Ficoll is also part of Ficoll-Paque used in biology laboratories to separate blood to its components (erythrocytes, leukocytes etc.,). Role of Ficoll in the urea induced denaturation of protein Fibrinogen (Fg) has been analyzed using fluorescence, circular dichroism, molecular docking and interfacial studies. Fluorescence studies show that Ficoll prevents quenching of Fg in the presence of urea. From the circular dichroism spectra, Fg shows conformational transition to random coil with urea of 6 M concentration. Ficoll helps to shift this denaturation concentration to 8 M and thus constraints by shielding Fg during the process. Molecular docking studies indicate that Ficoll interacts favorably with the protein than urea. The surface tension and shear viscosity analysis shows clearly that the protein is shielded by Ficoll. © 2016 Author(s).},

abstract={Water soluble perylenediimide based fluorophore salt, N,N′-bis(ethelenetrimethyl ammoniumiodide)-perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylicbisimide (PDI-1), has been used for selective fluorescence sensing of picric acid (PA) and 4-nitroaniline (4-NA) in organic as well as aqueous medium across wide pH range (1.0 to 10.0). PDI-1 showed strong fluorescence in dimethylformamide (DMF) (Φf = 0.26 (DMF) and moderate fluorescence in water. Addition of picric acid (PA) and 4-nitroaniline (4-NA) into PDI-1 in DMF/aqueous solution selectively quenches the fluorescence. The concentration dependent studies showed decrease of fluorescence linearly with increase of PA and 4-NA concentration. The interference studies demonstrate high selectivity for PA and 4-NA. Interestingly, PDI-1 showed selective fluorescence sensing of PA and 4-NA across wide pH range (1.0 to 10.0). Selective fluorescence sensing of PA and 4-NA has also been observed with trifluoroacetate (PDI-2), sulfate (PDI-3) salt of PDI-1 as well as octyl chain substituted PDI (PDI-4) without amine functionality. These studies suggest that PA and 4-NA might be having preferential interaction with PDI aromatic core and quenches the fluorescence. Thus PDI based dyes have been used for selective fluorescent sensing of explosive NACs for the first time to the best our knowledge. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Proteins belonging to the same class, having similar structures thus performing the same function are known to have different thermal stabilities depending on the source- thermophile or mesophile. The variation in thermo-stability has not been attributed to any unified factor yet and understanding this phenomenon is critically needed in several areas, particularly in protein engineering to design stable variants of the proteins. Toward this motive, the present study focuses on the sequence and structural investigation of a dataset of 373 pairs of proteins; a thermophilic protein and its mesophilic structural analog in each pair, from the perspectives of hydrophobic free energy, hydrogen bonds, physico-chemical properties of amino acids and residue-residue contacts. Our results showed that the hydrophobic free energy due to carbon, charged nitrogen and charged oxygen atoms was stronger in 65% of thermophilic proteins. The number of hydrogen bonds which bridges the buried and exposed regions of proteins was also greater in case of thermophiles. Amino acids of extended shape, volume and molecular weight along with more medium and long range contacts were observed in many of the thermophilic proteins. These results highlight the preference of thermophiles toward the amino acids with larger side chain and charged to make up greater free energy, better packing of residues and increase the overall compactness. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Eye infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important cause of ocular morbidity. We presents the whole genomic comparative analysis of two P. aeruginosa VRFPA03 and VRFPA05 isolated from alkaline chemical injury mediated keratitis and post-cataract surgery endophthalmitis patients, respectively. The blaDIM-1 gene in VRFPA03 and the blaGes-9 gene in VRFPA05 were identified and reported for the first time from an ocular isolate. The current study revealed novel integrons In1107 and In1108, comprised of multidrug-resistant genes. Ocular virulence factors mainly mediated by exoenzymes T, Y, and U and exotoxin A, elastase B, and phenazine-specific methyltransferase. Genomic analysis uncovered multiple known and unknown factors involved in P. aeruginosa mediated ocular infection, which may lead to drug discovery and diagnostic markers to improve human vision care. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Unbaffled stirred tanks are extensively used in chemical process industries for variety of applications including semi-batch reactions. In un-baffled stirred tanks, impeller rotation generates a vortex and reactants are added into this vortex. There is a growing interest towards understanding the mixing performance of such unbaffled stirred vessels. The present work is aimed at providing experimental results on mixing time and solid particle distribution inside an unbaffled vessel using electrical resistance tomography (ERT). A methodology for using ERT for characterizing vortex and mixing in unbaffled stirred vessel was established. The ERT was used to measure the mixing time with and without solid particles (glass beads, 250. μm) in a stirred reactor. In this study, ERT technique was effectively applied for imaging solid-liquid flow and developed suitable data processing methodologies. It observed that estimated liquid phase mixing time for Un-baffled vessel was more as compared to baffled vessel. Radial solid concentration profiles showed Gaussian distribution inside the vessel. The presented methodology of using ERT and experimental results will be useful for designing and estimating mixing and solid distribution in unbaffled stirred tanks. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Metabolic efficiency depends on the balance between supply and demand of metabolites, which is sensitive to environmental and physiological fluctuations, or noise, causing shortages or surpluses in the metabolic pipeline. How cells can reliably optimize biomass production in the presence of metabolic fluctuations is a fundamental question that has not been fully answered. Here we use mathematical models to predict that enzyme saturation creates distinct regimes of cellular growth, including a phase of growth arrest resulting from toxicity of the metabolic process. Noise can drive entry of single cells into growth arrest while a fast-growing majority sustains the population. We confirmed these predictions by measuring the growth dynamics of Escherichia coli utilizing lactose as a sole carbon source. The predicted heterogeneous growth emerged at high lactose concentrations, and was associated with cell death and production of antibiotic-tolerant persister cells. These results suggest how metabolic networks may balance costs and benefits, with important implications for drug tolerance. © 2016 Ray et al.},

abstract={Histone modulations have been implicated in various cellular and developmental processes where in Drosophila Mof is involved in acetylation of H4K16. Reduction in the size of larval imaginal discs is observed in the null mutants of mof with increased apoptosis. Deficiency involving Hid, Reaper and Grim [H99] alleviated mof RNAi induced apoptosis in the eye discs. mof RNAi induced apoptosis leads to activation of caspases which is suppressed by over expression of caspase inhibitors like P35 and Diap1clearly depicting the role of caspases in programmed cell death. Also apoptosis induced by knockdown of mof is rescued by JNK mutants of bsk and tak1 indicating the role of JNK in mof RNAi induced apoptosis. The adult eye ablation phenotype produced by ectopic expression of Hid, Rpr and Grim, was restored by over expression of Mof. Accumulation of Mof at the Diap1 promoter 800 bp upstream of the transcription start site in wild type larvae is significantly higher (up to twofolds) compared to mof 1 mutants. This enrichment coincides with modification of histone H4K16Ac indicating an induction of direct transcriptional up regulation of Diap1 by Mof. Based on these results we propose that apoptosis triggered by mof RNAi proceeds through a caspase-dependent and JNK mediated pathway. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Cataracts, glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration are known as major ocular problems which cause blindness among the elderly population worldwide. Oxidative stress plays an important role in both the initiation and progression of ocular problems and with respect to this; dietary antioxidants can serve as a therapeutic strategy for the improvement of ocular health. Zeaxanthin is known as one of the most important and common xanthophyll carotenoids, possessing multiple therapeutic effects such as strong antioxidant and pro-oxidant behaviour as well as anti-inflammatory effects. A growing body of literature shows that zeaxanthin mitigates ocular problems and suppresses oxidative stress in the retinal tissues. This paper aims to critically review the available literature regarding the beneficial effects of zeaxanthin on ocular problems with emphasis on its chemistry, bioavailability, and sources. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Background Biopiracy mainly focuses on the use of biological resources and/or knowledge of indigenous tribes or communities without allowing them to share the revenues generated out of economic exploitation or other non-monetary incentives associated with the resource/knowledge. Methods Based on collaborations of scientists from five continents, we have created a communication platform to discuss not only scientific topics, but also more general issues with social relevance. This platform was termed 'PhytCancer -Phytotherapy to Fight Cancer' (www.phyt-cancer.uni-mainz.de). As a starting point, we have chosen the topic "biopiracy", since we feel this is of pragmatic significance for scientists working with medicinal plants. Results It was argued that the patenting of herbs or natural products by pharmaceutical corporations disregarded the ownership of the knowledge possessed by the indigenous communities on how these substances worked. Despite numerous court decisions in U.S.A. and Europe, several international treaties, (e.g. from United Nations, World Health Organization, World Trade Organization, the African Unity and others), sharing of a rational set of benefits amongst producers (mainly pharmaceutical companies) and indigenous communities is yet a distant reality. In this paper, we present an overview of the legal frameworks, discuss some exemplary cases of biopiracy and bioprospecting as excellent forms of utilization of natural resources. Conclusions We suggest certain perspectives, by which we as scientists, may contribute towards prevention of biopiracy and also to foster the fair utilization of natural resources. We discuss ways, in which the interests of indigenous people especially from developing countries can be secured. © 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

abstract={A highly efficient synthesis of 5,6-dihydrodibenzo[b,h][1,6]naphthyridines was achieved by reaction between 2-(N-propargylamino)benzaldehydes and arylamines in the presence of CuBr2. The in situ generated electron-deficient heterodienes bearing a tethered alkyne partner underwent an intramolecular inverse electron-demand hetero-Diels-Alder reaction followed by air oxidation to furnish the products in high yields. This reaction tolerated a large number of substituents to afford diverse products under mild conditions. This strategy was also successfully extended to the synthesis of 12,13-dihydro-6H-benzo[h]chromeno[3,4-b][1,6]naphthyridin-6-ones starting from 3-amino-2H-chromen-2-one, again in high yields. © 2015 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={The band structures and the electronic transport properties of In2O3 molecular device are studied with GGA/PBE exchange correlation functional using the Density Functional Theory (DFT). The band structure of In2O3 nanostructure exhibits the semiconducting behavior. The electron density is less in the indium sites than in the oxygen sites. The localization of charges is envisioned using density of states spectrum. The device density of states of In2O3 molecular device infers that the density of charges can be fine-tuned by increasing the bias voltage in the energy intervals. The transmission spectrum is used to study the transport properties of In2O3 molecular device. The possible transmission paths along In2O3 scattering region are visualized using transmission pathways.

abstract={Recently, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) has become a prime signaling protocol for the multimedia communication systems, though none of the researchers have analyzed its promising features, namely access independence, authentication scheme verification, AKA (Authentication and Key Agreement) security properties, 3GPP security properties, signal congestion, bandwidth consumption and computation overhead using the physical multimedia server-client platform. To examine the issues realistically, the existing authentication schemes, such as UMTS AKA, EPS AKA, Cocktail AKA, S AKA, HL AKA and ZZ AKA were designed and developed in the multimedia server-client systems deployed on Linux platform. The cross-examination revealed that the existing schemes failed to satisfy the IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) promising features, like mutual authentication, session-key sharing, (perfect) forward secrecy and implicit-key authentication. Thus, this paper proposes a Secure-Key Authentication and Key Agreement protocol (SK AKA) to meet out the standard demands of IMS. To curtail its authentication steps, the secure authentication vector SAV computes and dispenses the generated vectors between the multimedia server-client systems in advance, through the serving call session control function SCSCF. As a result, the execution steps of UMTS AKA are annulled for the sake of accomplishment of the IMS features. In addition, the protocol of SK AKA integrates the strategies of Context Identity CID and Elliptic Curve – Diffie Hellman (EC-DH) to resist most of the potential attacks like SIP flooding, forgery, man-in-the-middle, password guessing and key impersonation. To analyze the parameters, such as (SIP) Flooding Attack Detection Rate, End-To-End Delay of Multiple Voice Call Session, Call Success Rate, SIP Utilization, RTP Utilization, Call Response Time, Bandwidth Consumption and Signalling Congestion realistically, the proposed and existing authentication schemes have been coded and integrated in the real-time IMS client-server system. Above all, the thoroughgoing research has revealed that the proposed protocol of SK AKA accomplishes all the IMS challenges: 1. Adhere the promising features of IMS; 2. Attack resiliency; and 3. Fulfill the promising parameters of IMS, in comparison with the other existing schemes. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Embelia ribes Burm. (Family: Myrsinaceae, Vidangam in Tamil) has been used as herbal drug for various diseases in Indian medicinal systems. Many research works have been focused on embelin (a high polar bioactive constituent), no study found on low polar compounds. Hence, in the present work we have analyzed the antioxidant and anticancer properties of three different fractions obtained from hexane extract of E. ribes fruit and also to reveal the volatile phytochemicals profile. Three fractions were obtained from hexane extract of Embelia ribes Burm using hexane-chloroform (80:20, V/V) in column chromatography. Fraction I (orange red colour), fraction II (brown colour) and fraction III (dark green colour) were analyzed for antioxidant (DPPH assay) and anticancer activities (EAC cell line model) and also the phytochemical profile was investigated using GC-MS. Among the three fractions investigated, fraction II exhibited higher level of antioxidant effect in terms of phosphomolybdate reducing power (IC50 0.21 mg/ml), DPPH radical scavenging activity (IC50 1.04 mg/ml) and superoxide radical inhibition activity (1.58 mg/ml). The anticancer assay also revealed that the fraction II was effective to control the growth of EAC cell lines (IC50 value 4.36 mg/ml) when compared to other fractions. GC-MS analysis revealed the presence of major volatile phytochemical constituents such as Dodecanoic acid and Ethyl tridecanoate, which could be responsible for the medicinal effects exhibited by the fraction II. Thus, fraction II of hexane extract of Embelia ribes with remarkable antioxidant and anticancer activities could be considered for further evaluation as anticancer drug in animal models. © 2016, International Journal of Pharmacognosy and Phytochemical Research.

The inhibition curves of captan, carbosulfan, TCDD and PCP were similar to Michaelis-Menten curve. TCDD held the minimum inhibitor Michaelis-Menten constant (KMI) value (10.2 nM) in comparison with PCP (10.9 nM), carbosulfan (14.5 nM) and captan (7.9 × 103 nM). The maximum inhibition of AChE enzyme by captan was about 100 %, which was much higher than that of TCDD (72.7 %), PCP (68.1 %) and carbosulfan (47.7 %). The calculated theoretical sensitivity was in the order of TCDD &gt; PCP &gt; carbosulfan &gt; captan. Comparing with TCDD (35.3 %), PCP (47.8 %) and carbosulfan (20.9 %), only the inhibition efficiency of captan (55.0 %) was the maximum.

abstract={Herein, we present a simple and green method for the synthesis of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) using the phytoproteins of spinach leaves. Under ambient sunlight irradiation, the isolated phytoprotein complex from spinach leaves reduces the gold chloride aqueous solution and stabilizes the formed AuNPs. As prepared nanoparticles were characterized by UV-visible spectroscopy, Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopy, zeta potential, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDS). The surface plasmon resonance (SPR) maximum for AuNPs was observed at 520 nm. The zeta potential value estimated for the AuNPs is - 27.0 mV, indicating that the NPs are well separated. Transmission electron micrographs revealed that the particles are spherical in nature with the size range from 10 to 15 nm. AuNPs act as a catalyst in the degradation of an azo dye, methyl orange in an aqueous environment. The reduction rate was determined to be pseudo-first order. Electrocatalytic efficiency of the synthesized AuNPs via this green approach was studied by chronoamperometry using ascorbic acid and hydrogen peroxide as a model compound for oxidation and reduction, respectively. Electrocatalytic studies indicate that the gold nanoparticles can be used to detect ascorbic acid and hydrogen peroxide in micromolar concentrations with response time less than 3 s. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Vegetable oil becomes polarized on oxidation and polymerization resulting in the formation of peroxide, triglycerides, etc. The quality and reusable state were investigated for sunflower, sesame, rice bran oil and model oil with the addition of oleic acid (2, 4 and 6 %) and antioxidants (citric and tert-Butyl hydroquinone-TBHQ). Excessive reclaims of cooking oil produce toxic by-products due to chemical breakdown that induce the production of polar compounds in oil. To determine the consumable fitness, variations of dielectric constant are observed at different temperatures (29 to 70 °C) and frequencies (1 to 107Hz) for the cooking oil. Physical parameters, such as viscosity and density associated with the saturated and unsaturated fatty acid, are also measured at different temperatures to determine the quality of oil. Dielectric constant and viscosity are correlated and analyzed using a newly developed equation with high correlation constant (R2 = 0.998) for oil added with citric acid. Oil added with 2–4 % of oleic acid is observed to have high determination coefficient (R2 &gt; 0.92). A lowest correlation (R2 = 0.6–0.7) was observed for the oil added with TBHQ. The present study also states that addition of TBHQ to oil does not impede oxidation reaction. Besides, even the shelf life of the oil could not be enhanced and may produce adverse effects in human health. © 2015, Association of Food Scientists & Technologists (India).},

The obtained ZnO nanoarchitectures were characterized using X-ray diffractometer (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), UV-vis spectrophotometer and electrometer to study their structural, morphological, optical and sensing properties respectively. The structural and morphological results revealed that transition metal doping effectively changed the microstructures and distorted the preferential orientation of (0 0 2) crystal plane with reference to the undoped ZnO. Acetaldehyde sensing characteristics of the undoped and doped ZnO nanoarchitectures were investigated. The sensing response towards 10 ppm was found to be 2.85, 800, 2.59 and 21.36 for the undoped, Co, Ni and Cu-doped ZnO nanostructures respectively. Co-doped ZnO nanostructure showed an excellent sensing response over a wide concentration range of 10-500 ppm of acetaldehyde. Moreover the sensing elements showed high selectivity towards acetaldehyde when exposed to 7 different vapours.

abstract={Introduction: In view of our previous studies showing an independent association of genetic polymorphisms in folate, xenobiotic, and toll-like receptor (TLR) pathways with the risk for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), we have developed three statistical models to delineate complex gene–gene interactions between folate, xenobiotic, TLR, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 (STAT4) signaling pathways in association with the molecular pathophysiology of SLE. Methods: We developed additive, multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR), and artificial neural network (ANN) models. Results: The additive model, although the simplest, suggested a moderate predictability of 30 polymorphisms of these four pathways (area under the curve [AUC] 0.66). MDR analysis revealed significant gene–gene interactions among glutathione-S-transferase (GST)T1 and STAT4 (rs3821236 and rs7574865) polymorphisms, which account for moderate predictability of SLE. The MDR model for specific auto-antibodies revealed the importance of gene–gene interactions among cytochrome P450, family1, subfamily A, polypeptide 1 (CYP1A1) m1, catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) H108L, solute carrier family 19 (folate transporter), member 1 (SLC19A1) G80A, estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1), TLR5, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase reductase (MTRR), thymidylate synthase (TYMS). and STAT4 polymorphisms. The ANN model for disease prediction showed reasonably good predictability of SLE risk with 30 polymorphisms (AUC 0.76). These polymorphisms contribute towards the production of SSB and anti-dsDNA antibodies to the extent of 48 and 40 %, respectively, while their contribution for the production of antiRNP, SSA, and anti-cardiolipin antibodies varies between 20 and 30 %. Conclusion: The current study highlighted the importance of genetic polymorphisms in folate, xenobiotic, TLR, and STAT4 signaling pathways as moderate predictors of SLE risk and delineates the molecular pathophysiology associated with these single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) by demonstrating their association with specific auto-antibody production. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract={The rising incidence of head and neck cancer and the drawbacks of currently used therapeutic strategies such as salvage surgery followed by adjuvant chemo- or radiotherapy have encouraged pursuits for better therapeutic approaches. This work describes the development and characterization of a PEGylated liposomal nanocarrier encapsulated with trans-resveratrol (Res), a plant stilbenoid, and doxorubicin hydrochloride (Dox), a standard chemotherapeutic agent for treatment of oral squamous cell carcinoma. The two drugs were loaded in liposomes prepared from egg phosphatidylcholine and DSPE-PEG with maximum encapsulation efficiencies of about 80% for each drug achieved at Res to Dox ratio of 2:1. The liposomal suspension was found to be stable with a zeta potential of -30.53 mV and size of approximately 250 nm. Thermal properties and release kinetics of the dual drug loaded liposomes were determined. The nanoformulation was evaluated for its in vitro anticancer efficacy on an oral squamous cell carcinoma cell line (NT8e). The cell uptake mechanism of the liposomal formulation was determined using pharmacological inhibitors for different endocytosis pathways. The combination effect of the two drugs was evaluated in free form and was found to have synergistic effects. The formulation was found to have a higher IC50 value than that of free doxorubicin hydrochloride but was found to have a superior effect on the signaling proteins involved in apoptosis and cell cycle. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Development of sustainable concrete has now become a mandatory requirement today due to environmental problems posed by the production of conventional concrete. Many researchers focused their research toward finding alternate materials for cement, sand, steel, etc., and came out with good results. This paper focuses on feasibility of developing sustainable concrete using bamboo as infill, stiffener, and combination of infill and reinforcement in the wall panels. In addition, low-density polyethylene waste also tried as infill material with bamboo as diagonal member. The structural property of bamboo was studied for replacing the conventional steel by designing the wall panels with lower stiffness and weight to avoid the catastrophic effect. The strength and behavior of infill wall panels for different infill cases were studied under uniaxial in-plane loading. Parameters such as maximum load carrying capacity, load–deflection characteristics, and cost effectiveness of bamboo-based wall panel system were considered in the present study. From the experimental results, it was understood that bamboo-based wall panel behaved as a ductile member and failed after due to the formation of micro-cracks. Wall panel specimens were failed with an out-plan buckling and resisted the force such that the sudden collapse was avoided. It was concluded that an infill wall reduced lateral and vertical deflection, thereby decreasing the probability of collapse. Hence, an infill wall panel could be used as a substitute for conventional wall panel. © 2015, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals.},

abstract={In the present study, cobalt oxide (Co3O4) magnetic nanoparticles with block and sphere morphologies were synthesized using various surfactants, and the toxicity of the particles was analyzed by monitoring biomarkers of nanoparticle toxicity in zebrafish. The use of tartarate as a surfactant produced highly crystalline blocks of Co3O4 nanoparticles with pores on the sides, whereas citrate lead to the formation of nanoparticles with a spherical morphology. Co3O4 structure, crystallinity, size and morphology were studied using X ray diffractogram and field emission scanning electron microscopy. Following an increase in nanoparticle concentration from 1 to 200 ppm, there was a corresponding increase in nitric oxide (NO) generation, induced by both types of nanoparticles [Co3O4 NP B (block), r=0.953; Co3O4 NP S (sphere), r=1.140]. Comparative analyses indicated that both types of nanoparticle produced significant stimulation at ≥5 ppm (P&lt;0.05) compared with a control. Upon analyzing the effect of nanoparticle morphology on NO generation, it was observed that Co3O4 NP S was more effective compared with Co3O4 NP B (5 and 100 ppm, P&lt;0.05; 200 ppm, P&lt;0.01). Exposure to both types of nanoparticles produced reduction in liver glutathione (GSH) activity with corresponding increase in dose (Co3O4 NP B, r= 0.359; Co3O4 NP S, r= 0.429). However, subsequent analyses indicated that Co3O4 NP B was more potent in inhibiting liver GSH activity compared with Co3O4 NP S. Co3O4 NP B proved to be toxic at 5 ppm (P&lt;0.05) and GSH activity was almost completely inhibited at 200 ppm. A similar toxicity was observed with both types of Co3O4 NPs against brain levels of acetylcholinesterase (AChE; Co3O4 NP B, r= 0.180; Co3O4 NP S, r= 0.230), indicating the ability of synthesized Co3O4 NPs to cross the blood brain barrier and produce neuronal toxicity. Co3O4 NP B showed increased inhibition of brain AChE activity compared with Co3O4 NP S (1,5, and 10 ppm, P&lt;0.05; 50, 100 and 200 ppm, P&lt;0.01). These results suggested that the morphology of nanoparticle and surface area contribute to toxicity, which may have implications for their biological application. © 2016, Spandidos Publications.

abstract={The surface of eukaryotic cells is a multi-component fluid bilayer in which glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins are an abundant constituent. In this review, we discuss the complex nature of the organization and dynamics of GPI-anchored proteins at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Different biophysical techniques have been utilized for understanding this organization, including fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, single particle tracking, and a number of super resolution methods. Major insights into the organization and dynamics have also come from exploring the short-range interactions of GPI-anchored proteins by fluorescence (or Förster) resonance energy transfer microscopy. Based on the nanometer to micron scale organization, at the microsecond to the second time scale dynamics, a picture of the membrane bilayer emerges where the lipid bilayer appears inextricably intertwined with the underlying dynamic cytoskeleton. These observations have prompted a revision of the current models of plasma membrane organization, and suggest an active actin-membrane composite. © 2016 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

abstract={Transmembrane protease serine 4 is a well known cell surface protease facilitating the extracellular matrix degradation and epithelial mesenchymal transition in hepatocellular carcinoma. Henceforth targeting transmembrane protease serine 4 is strongly believed to provide therapeutic intervention against hepatocellular carcinoma. Owing to lack of crystal structure for human transmembrane protease serine 4, we predicted its three dimensional structure for the first time in this study. Experimentally proven inhibitor-Tyroserleutide (TSL) against hepatocellular carcinoma via transmembrane protease serine 4 was used as a benchmark to identify structurally similar candidates from PubChem database to create the TSL library. Virtual screening of TSL library against modeled transmembrane protease serine 4 revealed the top four potential inhibitors. Further binding free energy (ΔGbind) analysis of the potential inhibitors revealed the best potential lead compound against transmembrane protease serine 4. Drug likeliness nature of the top four potential hits were additionally analyzed in comparison to TSL to confirm on the best potential lead compound with the highest % of human oral absorption. Consequently, e-pharmacophore mapping of the best potential lead compound yielded a six point feature. It was observed to contain four hydrogen bond donor sites (D), one positively ionizable site (P) and one aromatic ring (R). Such e-pharmacophore insight obtained from structural determinants by integrated computational analysis could serve as a framework for further advancement of drug discovery process of new anti-cancer agents with less toxicity and high specificity targeting transmembrane protease serine 4 and hepatocellular carcinoma. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Recent studies have shown that tumor development and progression depend not only on the perturbed genes that govern cell proliferation, but is also highly determined by the non-tumor cells of the stromal compartment surrounding the tumor called tumor microenvironment (TME). These findings highlight the importance of targeting the microenvironment in combination with therapies aimed at tumor cells as a valuable approach. The innate and adaptive immune cells in the TME interact among themselves and also with the endothelial cells, pericytes and mast cells of the stromal compartment through various autocrine and paracrine manner to regulate abnormal cell proliferation. Direct cytotoxic killing of cancer cells and/or reversion of the immunosuppressive TME are to be considered as better strategies for chemoprevention and chemotherapy. With a growing emphasis on a "hallmark targeting" strategy for cancer therapy, the TME now appears as a promising target for cancer prevention using natural products. Clarification on the nontumor stromal cells, the mediators involved, interactions with immune response cells, and immune-evasive mechanisms are needed in order to manipulate the characteristics of the TME by natural pharmacological agents to design effective therapies. This review will provide a glimpse on the roles played by various non-tumor cells in tumor progression and their intervention by pharmacological agents. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Alkali-activated concretes are a novel invention for substituting conventional construction materials; their main variation from conventional Portland cement concretes is utilizing comparatively alkali-rich, clinker-free binder matrix namely alkali-activated slag or geopolymer. Alkali-activated concrete is an environmental friendly and possibly considered to be a part of the sustainable development. Since, aggregates constitutes the major part of the concrete, there is a need to reduce the use of natural aggregate thereby reducing the exploitation of natural resources. This paper explains the influence of recycled concrete aggregates derived from the demolished concrete waste on the mechanical properties of geopolymer concrete (GPC). Since, very few studies been conducted using recycled aggregates in geopolymer concrete under ambient curing, an experimental work was carried out involving mixes with varying proportion of recycled aggregates and their influence on the physical, mechanical and flexural characteristics of geopolymer concrete. The results infer that the inclusion of recycled aggregate improves the strength characteristics of geopolymer concrete. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Choline, a type of Vitamin B, is an important nutrient in the human body and is involved in key metabolic pathways. Abnormal levels of choline leads to diseased conditions. The levels of choline and its associated compounds are found to be elevated in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients. The choline level ranges from 0.4 to 4.9mmol/kg in TNBC. Thus the detection of choline levels in cells can aid in diagnosing breast cancer. The present work aims to develop a nano-interfaced electrochemical biosensor for the rapid detection of choline in cancer cells. For electrochemical detection, glassy carbon electrode coated with a zinc oxide nano-interface was used as the working electrode. Zinc oxide synthesized by hydrothermal method was characterized using SEM and XRD. The choline oxidase (ChOx) enzyme was immobilized on the nano-interface by drop-casting. Choline oxidase (ChOx) converts choline to betaine and H2O2 in the presence of oxygen. The H2O2 produced was determined amperometrically. The amount of H2O2 produced is directly proportional to concentration of choline present. The sensitivity, selectivity, stability and concentration studies were carried out and quantification of choline in TNBC was also carried out. The results demonstrate that this biosensor has the potential to be developed as a clinical tool for breast cancer detection. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Nonlinear optical (NLO) activity of the compound (2E)-2-(ethoxycarbonyl)-3-[(1-methoxy-1-oxo-3-phenylpropan-2-yl)amino] prop-2-enoic acid is investigated experimentally and theoretically using X-ray crystallography and quantum chemical calculations. The NLO activity is confirmed by both powder Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) experiment and first hyper polarizability calculation. The title compound displays 8 fold excess of SHG activity when compared with the standard compound KDP. The gas phase geometry optimization and vibrational frequencies calculations are performed using density functional theory (DFT) incorporated in B3LYP with 6-311G++(d,p) basis set. The title compound crystallizes in non-centrosymmetric space group P21. Moreover, the crystal structure is primarily stabilized through intramolecular N-H⋯O and O-H⋯O hydrogen bonds and intermolecular C-H⋯O and C-H⋯π interactions. These intermolecular interactions are analyzed and quantified using Hirshfeld surface analysis and PIXEL method. The detailed vibrational assignments are performed on the basis of the potential energy distributions (PED) of the vibrational modes. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Globally, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer and represents approximately 6% of all diagnosed cancers. The use of anti-cancer drugs, such as docetaxel, doxorubicin (DOX), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and cisplatin (diammine dichloroplatinum(II), CDDP), is limited due to their non-specificity, drug resistance, and toxicity. A combinatorial approach may improve the efficacy of these chemotherapeutic drugs and reduce their non-specific toxicities. In the present study, curcumin, an anti-cancer phytochemical, was used in combination with 5-FU, doxorubicin, and cisplatin and their combinatorial effect on the HNSCC cell line NT8e was investigated. Our results showed that the combination of 5-FU or DOX with curcumin exhibited significant growth inhibition and enhanced apoptosis in NT8e cancer cells. Treatment with 5-FU or DOX in combination with curcumin induced apoptosis by inhibiting Bcl-2 and increasing Bax, caspase-3, and poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) in NT8e cells. This was further confirmed through apoptotic characteristic features in cells, such as membrane blebbing, nuclear condensation, and cell shrinkage, as observed by DAPI staining and through decreased red/green fluorescence by JC-1. These two combinations also exhibited cell cycle growth arrest at the G1/S phase, which was confirmed by downregulation of cyclins (D1, E2, B1, and A2), CDK2, and increased p21 levels. In addition, curcumin exposure along with 5-FU or DOX inhibited cell proliferation through the downregulation of EGFR-ERK1/2 signaling molecules. Overall, our data demonstrates the promising therapeutic potential and underlying mechanisms of curcumin with 5-FU/DOX combinations as a new treatment modality for head and neck cancer management. © 2015 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Microwave-assisted solid-liquid extraction (MAE) of flavonoids from Terminalia bellerica Roxb. has been investigated to understand the influence of solvent-to-feed ratio (5-40 mL/g) and temperature (40-100 °C) on kinetics and thermodynamics of extraction. The flavonoid concentration-time data were analysed using a second order kinetic model to determine extraction constant. A diffusion model was utilized to determine diffusion coefficient taking into account of both washing and diffusion phases together. Solvent-to-feed ratio and temperature were observed to show a significant effect on flavonoid yield, extraction rate and effective diffusion coefficient with the highest solvent-to-feed ratio and temperature providing the maximum flavonoid yield of 25.21 mgQE/g using water as the solvent. An empirical equation has been developed to predict extraction kinetics. Thermodynamic parameters revealed MAE process to be spontaneous and endothermic. The kinetic and diffusion models provided valuable insights into the microwave assisted extraction process. T. bellerica was observed to be a good source of flavonoids. Therefore, MAE is a suitable method for extraction of flavonoids from T. bellerica when water alone is to be used as the solvent, as in the case of traditional Indian medicinal preparations. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={We investigate the remarkable role of position-dependent damping in determining the parametric regions of symmetry breaking in nonlinear PT-symmetric systems. We illustrate the nature of PT-symmetry preservation and breaking with reference to a remarkable integrable scalar nonlinear system. In the two-dimensional cases of such position-dependent damped systems, we unveil the existence of a class of twofold-PT-symmetric systems which have twofold PT symmetries. We analyze the dynamics of these systems and show how symmetry breaking occurs, that is, whether the symmetry breaking of the two PT symmetries occurs in pair or occurs one by one. The addition of linear damping in these nonlinearly damped systems induces competition between the two types of damping. This competition results in a PT phase transition in which the PT symmetry is broken for lower loss or gain strength and is restored by increasing the loss or gain strength. We also show that by properly designing the form of the position-dependent damping, we can tailor the PT-symmetric regions of the system. © 2016 American Physical Society.},

abstract={Groundnut shell ash, cement and their combinations are used as soil stabilizers in various percentages to improve the strength of locally available highly compressible clay soil. The effect of stabilizer in improving the strength of the soil is evaluated through change in consistency limits, compaction characteristics, undrained cohesion and modulus of elasticity. The durability characteristics of stabilised soil were studied based on the improvement of undrained shear strength for various days of curing by increasing the percentage of cement. Stabilised soil showed satisfactory improvement in strength and consistent durability characters. Groundnut shell ash and cement increased the optimum moisture content. There was a slight decrease in the dry density and modulus of elasticity of soil. These can be used as a viable economic alternative in construction of roads and for stabilising soil acting as bearing medium. The use of groundnut shell ash, an agricultural waste, helps in waste management and promotes sustainable development of local construction industry. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Hydrogen peroxide is called a green propellant in rocketry and is a monopropellant. Recent advances in the development of micro-thrusters for mini/micro-satellites require a thorough knowledge of the reactions occurring in these types of thrust chambers. A monopropellant such as hydrogen peroxide is preferred in micro-thrusters because the chemical is self-decomposable or undergoes catalytic decomposition. The catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide when using a platinum or silver catalyst results in two-phase flow in mini/micro-channel thrusters. Also, the introduction of air in such reactions will increase turbulence, enhancing the reaction. The present work is an attempt to understand the phenomena of slug formation in an annular mixing section. Various two-phase flow patterns of a hydrogen peroxide and air mixture is numerically simulated with ANSYS Fluent 12.1 using the volume of fluids method. A tube of 100 mm length and 2.50 mm diameter is used in the experiments. The bubble and slug–bubble flow patterns formed using four different concentrations (0%, 6%, 30%, and 70%) of hydrogen peroxide are analyzed. To validate the numerical results, experimental flow visualization of the 6% hydrogen peroxide concentration is analyzed with image processing techniques. The results are in good agreement and the effect of the core annular mixing section on the formation of the slug–bubble regime is detailed. © 2016 by Begell House, Inc.},

abstract={Increased expression of efflux transport proteins confers the Multi Drug Resistant (MDR) phenotype to drug resistant bacteria, which can be mitigated by efflux pump inhibitors (EPI). EPI's have the dual advantage of restoring efficacy of antibiotics and retarding the evolution of drug resistant mutants. In this study, 17 heterocyclic derivatives synthesized by a polyethylenimine (PEI) catalyzed one-pot protocol were evaluated for their EPI potential. Based on in silico studies and in vitro studies, 5 benzochromene (BC) based compounds (among 17 heterocyclic derivatives), were observed to significantly potentiate the effect of ciprofloxacin (CPX) and displayed a best modulation factor of 32, against the NorA overexpressed mutant SA-1199B. Toxicity analyses using the zebrafish model showed that, from all the benzochromene compounds evaluated, BC9 exhibited low toxicity. BC9 inhibited the NorA efflux pump at a minimum effective concentration (MEC) of 2 mg ml1 (4.03 mM) and even at subinhibitory concentrations, and it was effective in reversing the CPX MIC of both the ATCC strain and a clinical isolate of MRSA by 128 and 4 fold respectively. Our results show that benzochromene derivative BC9 is a highly specific NorA inhibitor that can be employed to mitigate MDR strains of S. aureus that overexpress the NorA efflux pump. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.},

abstract={The most predominant opportunistic fungal pathogens Candida sp, Aspergillus and Cryptococcus sp are emerging as a global problem of great concern as it is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Although there are different classes of approved antifungal agents like polyenes, pyrimidines, azoles, and echinocandins, the morbidity and mortality rate due to systemic infection remains high, due to its toxicity, narrow spectrum of activity and tolerability. The continuous usages of these drugs are associated with resistance development and thus this is another area of emerging global problem. In addition, biofilm formation by fungal pathogens are proven to be an important virulence factor and are resistant to host defense mechanism and antifungal agents. Combination therapy has shown to be a promising choice to overcome the emergence of drug resistance, minimizing the toxic effects by reducing the drug dosage, and to increase the spectrum of killing. In this chapter, we have reviewed the last 5 years' developments made in combinational antifungal therapy with special emphasize on biofilm related infections and have presented a reappraisal of the current practices associated with immunotherapy to treat fungal infections and future challenges. © Springer India 2016.

abstract={A total of 44 (forty-four) pre- and post-tsunami surface sediment samples collected from various coastal geomorphic units at the same locations along 35 km long coastal stretch of Central Tamil Nadu coast between Poompuhar and Nagoor were utilized for foraminiferal studies to trace the tsunami signature. A total of twenty-five foraminifera species belonging to eleven genera and eight families have been identified from the study area. While comparing the foraminifera of the pre-tsunami sediments with the post tsunami sediments, it has been observed that in the post tsunami sediments, the total foraminiferal numbers (TFN) have been increased quite significantly along with the occurrences of several new genera and species of foraminifera in the area where the beach width are wide. The present study indicates that the chances of the preservation of tsunami sediments are more in those tsunami affected coastal area where the beach width are wide. © 2016 CAFET-INNOVA TECHNICAL SOCIETY.

abstract={Since ancient times, Malvaceae family plant members are distributed worldwide and have been used as a folk remedy for the treatment of skin diseases, as an antifertility agent, antiseptic, and carminative. Some compounds isolated from Malvaceae members such as flavonoids, phenolic acids, and polysaccharides are considered responsible for these activities. Although the flavonoid profiles of several Malvaceae family members are investigated, the information is scattered. To understand the chemical variability and chemotaxonomic relationship among Malvaceae family members summation of their phytochemical nature is essential. Hence, this review aims to summarize the distribution of flavonoids in species of genera namely Abelmoschus, Abroma, Abutilon, Bombax, Duboscia, Gossypium, Hibiscus, Helicteres, Herissantia, Kitaibelia, Lavatera, Malva, Pavonia, Sida, Theobroma, and Thespesia, Urena, In general, flavonols are represented by glycosides of quercetin, kaempferol, myricetin, herbacetin, gossypetin, and hibiscetin. However, flavonols and flavones with additional OH groups at the C-8 A ring and/or the C-5' B ring positions are characteristic of this family, demonstrating chemotaxonomic significance.},

abstract={To make certain the software Quality, Software testing is one of the most significant processes in Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Software systems develop regularly to offer the necessary functionalities and to acclimatize to ever-changing customer necessitates. Regression testing points out to the portion of the test cycle in which a syllabus is experimented to make certain that alters do not influence characteristics such as adding novel characteristics or adapting presented characteristics that are not supposed to be influenced. The Regression testing is used to modified versions of the software to make certain that the modified characteristics perform equally and that the changes did not generate unexpected faults, moreover known as deterioration errors. As a result, in order to spot such errors, Software regression testing is necessary. The most important plan of the suggested system is to execute the software regression testing with a reduced amount of time and cost devoid of changing the quality. For this, we will promise the quality of the software tool in terms of quality metrics such as dependability and maintainability, etc after optimizing the test suite. By using Improved Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm (IPSO), the test suite optimization will be prepared. With different devices such as JDepend and Rayleigh's model, the quality metrics will be computed. © Copyright 2016 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.},

abstract={A cold-formed steel section is more sensitive to local buckling than typical hot rolled sections. It is characterized by light weight, high strength, economical, wide variety, smooth surface and accurate size. The web panels are used as stiffened plates that can receive both high shear and high moment in different sections or in the same section depending on the beam statical system. One of the methods of reducing the web thickness is the use of corrugated sheets as webs. However, they are suggestible to various modes of buckling including local and distortional buckling. The main aim of this thesis is to find the maximum load carrying capacity of the specimen and possible modes of failure under two point loading at the corrugated web in cold formed sections with varying thickness. Steel I section with the corrugated web having two flanges are welded with the web. The length of the specimen is kept constant for 1200mm and the thickness is varied from 0.7mm, 0.9mm, and 1.2mm.The results for a simply supported beam is subjected to a two point loading are examined. Finally, numerical analysis using ANSYS 15.1 results are analysed and justified with experimental results for an explanation.},

The vasthu-sastra insists the principles of positioning of inner rooms, the ground and the building. This elaborates the relationship between the man and his physical body, the building and the world. Hence this go beyond Design and Architecture. The people living inside a building are the 'material' who perceives and conceives the vasthu related to the environment. The earth, water etc., are the five elements in order and is said to be the 'Medium'of vasthu. The fundamental principles of vasthu with scientific reasons are analyzed with engineering aspects in present day buildings like houses, commercial buildings, flats and the better and alternate affordable arrangements are suggested as per vasthu - sastra with green building techniques. The draw backs in our present method are noted. For example the provision of a central open yard which is very genuine to give good living conditions inside a building in tropical countries like ours and is neglected in our present day methods. This is not scientifically correct. Actually this provision was given to each and every building including houses in our country prior to one century. The draw backs in our present conventional method and its overcoming by vasthu for safety and pleasant living inside are pointed out in this paper. © IAEME Publication.},

abstract={Multicasting is a significant operation that provides communication between users in a group manner. Optimizing the throughput and increasing the bandwidth utilization is a difficult issue. In addition to the traditional multicast routing protocols followed, recent multicasting schemes followed adaptive Beamforming and multipath power control transmission increasing robustness and minimizing end-to-end packet delays. However, the bandwidth consumption reduced with the increase in the robustness and therefore minimizing rate of throughput. In this work, to improve the bandwidth rate and throughput with minimum execution time, an integrated Bandwidth and Throughput Optimized scheme for Efficient Multicasting (BTO-EM) is designed. We initially present the design and implementation of Neighbor Routing Table based Bandwidth-Quality (NRT-BQ) metrics in BTO-EM framework. The NRT-BQ addresses the problem of bandwidth efficiency by proposing efficient algorithm based on the neighboring node bandwidth. Next, a Markovian-based Data Packet Transmission strategy is designed aiming at reducing the time taken to obtain optimal route path. This is achieved by evaluating number of receiver and non receiver nodes. Finally, Tree-based Multicast Throughput is constructed with the objective of improving the rate of throughput based on the number of data packet transmission, data packet transmission for 'nth tree' and data packet transmission for each session. This ensures the increased rate of throughput and therefore improving the overall network. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of BTO-EM. The experimental evaluation is carried out on the factors such as bandwidth, time delay, throughput, node density, number of data packets sent in the network. Experimental analysis shows that BTO-EM framework is able to reduce the average delay time for obtaining the route by 37.99% and improve the rate of bandwidth by 8.50% compared to the stateof- the-art works. © International Science Press.},

abstract={This paper gives the improvement in efficiency of solar photovoltaic module. The major factor which is given more concentration is temperature of solar cell, which is inversely proportional to the electrical efficiency of the PV module. Improved efficiency is achieved by circulating fluids through heat extracting pipes by heat exchanging method. To reduce the panel temperature, the solar PV is combined with thermal exchange unit. The fluid is allowed to circulate through the thermal exchange unit and the heat is exchanged with the tubes through conduction and convection process under different modes of circulation. By this we achieve the reduction in panel temperature which in turn increases the solar PV efficiency. Experimental result shows increase in electrical efficiency by comparing at circulating and non-circulating modes of fluid and also the efficient use of heat extracted from the PV module for general application and in low power generation when viewed at large scale. © International Science Press.},

abstract={The current study explored the relationship between big five personality factors and various stressors of the students who are undergraduate, postgraduate and research scholars from nine colleges in North Chennai. The study is based on quantitative data with descriptive research design. The 20-item personality inventory developed by Donnellen et al. (2006) was used to analyse their personality and the stressors was measured using MSSQ (Medical Student Stressor Questionnaire) scale developed by Yusoff (2011). A total of 250 students were selected as respondents using cluster random sampling technique. It revealed a significant positive relationship with neuroticism and three types of stressors (academic, inter and intra personal and social). It also throws light on the personality trait, namely openness to experience played a major role in predicting the academic performance (CGPA). Through regression, it can be concluded that personality has a significant positive relationship with both academic and social stressors. The findings will provide appropriate measures for educators by realizing the importance of personality the student possesses and applying suitable strategies for them to improve their academic performance. The dispersal of the study’s findings will significantly help students and the educators in the region. © 2016, Edizioni Universitarie di Lettere Economia Diritto. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Switched mode power supplies (SMPS) play a vital role in digital processors and personal computer based control applications. The performance of the SMPS depends upon the choice of control strategy. In this paper, a neural network based control strategy is proposed for the bridgeless converter based MOSMPS with buck-boost and cuk converter topologies for output voltage regulation and power quality improvement at the input ac side. The proposed topologies have reduced conduction losses and thermal stress across the switches due to the absence of input diode bridge rectifier. The bridgeless converter is operated in discontinuous conduction mode to offer inherent power factor correction (PFC) for wide variation in input voltages and is cascaded to an isolated dc-dc converter with a High Frequency Transformer (HFT) to achieve multiple dc voltages such as ±12V and ± 5V applicable for PC power supply. The proposed converter topologies are simulated using MATLAB/Simulink software and their performances are analyzed in terms of output voltage regulation, Total Harmonic Distortion of source current and input power factor under varying source conditions. The performance of the proposed controller is also compared with that of conventional controller. The simulation results are validated using the prototype model developed. © 2016 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.},

abstract={Pixels are the smallest solitary constituent of a digital image. Breaking down an image into its composite pixels elucidates its properties and subjecting it to thresholding helps to perceive the decomposition of its pixels rationally. This is done in assent with the pixel properties based on a threshold value. However, thresholding does not assure that these decomposed pixels are always pure. The odds of discerning the distortion (noise) enmeshed in the grey scale values are high. Hence removal of noise from the image is given paramount importance. Multiscale gradient multiplication is a method to obtain optimal threshold value which can be used to effectively eliminate grey level distortion upon segmentation. This method multiplies the responses from various filters operating at different scales. The proposed technique assists in eliminating distortion in grey levels while improving robustness towards edge signals, and thus, considerably outperforms other conventional methods. © 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={A remote classroom is one of the successful technologies to share knowledge beyond boundaries and to a large population. But the remote classroom demands for high-end visual systems to display the teachers' writings, which are costly and cannot be afforded by all. This paper presents an alternate idea of using a cable driven robot as a blackboard writer, which is able to replicate the teachers' writing on a blackboard. A planar fully constraint cable driven robot with a writer as an end-effectors is employed as a blackboard writer. It is basically an X-Y plotter that navigates on the planar plane according to the desired trajectory. A novel method for trajectory planning called 'appending trajectory points' was also introduced such that the CDR can faithfully follow the trajectory. The trajectory planner appends trajectory points to decrease the rate change and achieve bumpless transfer in the trajectory. An adaptive PD control scheme was employed for closed loop control to track the trajectory. Finally, the performance of the proposed controller was compared with the conventional PD controller and results are discussed in detail. © 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

The Sudan Black B staining and Nile Blue A staining were carried out to confirm that the isolated strain was capable of producing PHB. Further, it was subjected to morphological, biochemical and molecular characterization. The 16S rRNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis confirmed the organism was Bacillus cereus BB613 with accession number LN613102. The growth parameter and usage of low cost substrate for production was optimized. The maximum PHB accumulation was found at 30°C and pH 7. 0 after 48h incubation. For the production of PHB, 1% sucrose was used as carbon source. Sucrose was then substituted by low cost substrates such as mosambi peel, orange peel, banana peel and molasses which gave yields 35. 2%, 26. 7%, 32. 1% and 33. 9% respectively. © 2016, Sphinx Knowledge House.

abstract={Image thresholding is most important in image processing for unfolding foreground objects. In recent years, many thresholding methods have been proposed. However, identifying the weld defects on weld X-radiography images is a challenging task in Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) methods. Generally radiography images are in low contrast and lack of details. It is very difficult to extract the weld defects that are present. The main goal on this paper is to give comparative discussion on different threshold-based segmentation methods through performance measures. The thresholding techniques applied on various weld X-radiography images and their performance have been evaluated by non-uniformity (NU), misclassification error (ME) and relative foreground area error (RAE) measures. This performance analysis is supportive for an appropriate use of existing thresholding techniques on weld X-radiography image segmentation. © 2006-2016 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).},

abstract={In software development lifecycle, team formation is playing an indispensable role in developing software application. Standard and ad-hoc principles are available for team formations. Newly adopted key factors are incorporated nowadays for the optimal group selection or team formation. Past records, innovative ideologies and relevant experiences in the field brings real intuition of a person which is essential to form a good team to achieve the ultimate goal of a project or a task set completion. In this article a systematic investigation on team formation is carried out to identify the current region of interest by tapping the unfilled gaps in the team formation agenda and to understand the effects of teams in product development scenarios. A Selective Search (SS) mechanism is adopted to collect 100 papers for survey. A systematic investigation on teams is carried out using cohort study and regression approaches for a tournament based analysis. The validation of the model is done using test and measures from statistical themes. The intuitive inference that is obtained from the analysis is that, team formation has made an exhaustive effort on qualitative modeling but a subtle contribution towards quantitative model development. Also the concept of optimizing the quantified parameters adhering to teams using traditional or non-traditional optimization techniques is discussed only on a narrow lane. It is concluded that the current hot spots for effective team formation lies in the design of an optimized quantitative model. It also infers from the analysis that there is an effective need for both the cohort study and regression mechanism to understand the missing region in team formation by setting up a theoretic framework and wrapping it up using a mathematical principle. © 2006-2016 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).},

abstract={Landslides occur in hilly regions that are prone to activities of urban development, agricultural activities, construction of dams and road and railway network. The slope instability in hilly slope areas is due to construction activities, clearing the natural vegetation, unplanned resort development tourist activities, etc. The landslide susceptibility mapping is an effective tool for the development of hilly areas to analyse the slope stability along the road network. This paper attempts a GIS based multi-criterion methodology to identify landslide susceptibility zonation in CNG (Calicut - Nilampur - Gudalur) - 37 ghat section in Nadugani, Gudalur taluk, The Nilgiris district. The environmental geological factors used for the landslide susceptibility analysis include, geology, weathering thickness, geomorphology, lineament, lineament density, lineament intensity, lineament buffer and slope. By applying and integrating the multi-criterion weights using ArcGIS software, a landslide susceptibility zonation is obtained and the study area is divided into five classes which include very low, low, moderate, high and very high regions. The susceptibility zonation map shows that 1.60% in Very low, 18.49% in Low, 40.39% in Moderate, 33.78% in high and 5.74% very high hazard zone. The landslide susceptibility zonation map is validated with landslide points which were collected from the field using high performance GPS. According to landslide inventory details 1.25% is located in very high, 24.27% in high, 55.66% in moderate, 18.83% in low and 0% in very low hazard zones. © 2016 CAFET-INNOVA TECHNICAL SOCIETY.

abstract={Objectives: There have been many traditional product recommender systems in the past, but they were mostly based on collaborative or content filtering, historical transaction records or website browsing history of the users. This approach leads to sparsity and cold-start issues. Methods/Statistical Analysis: The proposed system is a hybrid one and can improve the suitability and the accuracy of recommender systems with the help of users' and products' demographic info and the ratings of a brand name, constantly updated in the e-commerce and social media websites. Findings: Experiments on the actual dataset reveal that friends with similar tendencies select the similar items and this approach can solve the relevant data sparsity and cold start problems. Initially, the system loads the data about the friends who have given product ratings and selects a target cold start user. Then it predicts his/her tech level and cost level using BMART algorithm. With the help of these, it finds the user-friends and user-items similarity using the cosine and Euclidean cluster similarity methods respectively. It then feeds these into the proposed ranking algorithm to find the relevance scores of the products to the target user and based on this the recommended product links are displayed. Application/Improvement: The outputs reveal that the proposed system gives very accurate and personalized product recommendations to the user.},

abstract={The increasing demand for biofuels using non-edible oil seeds (primarily jatropha circus) has assumed a gigantic proportion in a tropical country like India. However, one of the lee-side of this ambitious project is problems of handling the significant amount of deoiled cakes. These are essentially non-edible even for animals, although production of residue is often quite high. The present work aims to investigate the potential of deoiled cake as an adsorbent for the treatment of dye containing wastewaters. The model compound used was crystal violet dye. The batch studies indicate that at an equilibrium time of 3.5 h, 90% adsorption was observed at 400 ppm initial concentration. The kinetic modeling studies indicate that adsorption phenomenon seemed to be a chemisorption process. Among the isotherm models, Sip and Redlich-Peterson isotherm models are found to be best suited to the adsorption process. The deoiled cake studied demonstrated high potential for the removal of dyes from aqueous solution.},

abstract={Background/Objectives: Air pollution due to vehicular and industrial emission has become menace to the living beings. Due to this menace both indoor and outdoor air quality monitoring in real time has become mandatory. Methods/Statistical Analysis: The evolution of Internet of Things (IoT) and Single Board Computers (SBC) has made real time remote monitoring as a ubiquitous process. Remote monitoring was facilitiated using classical motes in the past, which has some pitfalls like limited memory, processsing speed and complex programming strategies. This paper portrays the usage of SBC for integration of IoT with WSN for Air Quality Monitoring System (AQMS), where SBC are capable of performing even complex task with enhanced speed and reduced complexity. The integration of cloud services with SBC makes alerting process smart and realtime. Findings: With the review and realizing of immense literature in the field of WSN for air quality management, the design of sensor web node becomes essential. The evolution of SBC adds merit towards monitoring and measuring of the critical factors in centralized Air Quality Monitoring System (AQMS) in any plant. Sensor web node is proposed with commercial gas sensors for detecting the gases like CO, CO2, NH3 and NOx to monitor both indoor and outdoor air quality. The observed results are properly evaluated using ThingSpeak open source IoT platform. The integration of open source cloud services for SBC in this proposed prototype model confirms low cost, comfort, convenience and rapid prototyping for flexible AQMS. Applications/Improvements: This prototype can be easily adapted to any monitoring systems with minor changes and can be made scalable for tomorrow.},

The objective of this study is to establish a two-phase parameter correlation to predict two-phase heat transfer coefficient which would be vital for the optimal design of heat transfer equipment. A new two-phase parameter called modified two-phase multiplier (MTPM) has been proposed and correlated with Lockhart-Martinelli parameter and Quality for different compositions of liquid-water systems. The experimental data was statistically analyzed to develop a correlation for two-phase liquid systems on tube side. The developed correlation predicts MTPM and two-phase heat transfer coefficient from single phase data with a maximum error of ±15 % for 7 different two-phase liquid systems.},

Delineating crucial residues mediating the heterodimer complexes (anti-apoptotic proteins - pro-apoptotic/BH3-only proteins) is indispensable to develop specific antagonists to anti-apoptotic proteins. In these backgrounds, we have herein reported crucial residues of hBaxBH3 and hBcl-B (an anti-apoptotic protein specifically interacts with human Bax but does not interact with human Bak) for hetero dimerization of the polypeptides and as well validated the structural determinants of the polypeptides through variety of virtual 'alanine mutants' and 'switch mutants' by using an array of computational methods. Residues such as D53, S60, E61, K64, E69 and D71 of hBaxBH3 and R45, H50, F53, F54, Y57, M71, S74, V75, R86, V88, T89, F93 and F159 of hBcl-B were found to be crucial residues of the polypeptides for intermolecular interaction leading hetero dimerization.

AFP2 displayed improved anticryptococcal activity post co-culture versus the parental type. The metabolomes of the parental and evolved strains were analyzed by HPLC-UV and GC-MS. The changes in phenotype and chemotype between the parental and the evolved strain were analyzed to determine the evolution of new traits. About 21 new metabolites alien to the parent strain were seen to be produced by the evolved strain. Among these, a few of the induced molecules such as dl-alanyl-l-leucine, dihydro-3,3-dimethyl-2(3H)-furanone, enanthamide, 1,3,5-cycloheptatriene and 1-aziridineethanol were not reported to have antifungal activity. In addition, these molecules were not reported in S. variabilis. Evolutionary fitness analysis revealed a 64-fold or 98% reduction in the growth of C. neoformans for the evolved strain S3, with an overexpression of compounds of ∼52%. Hence, the present study confirms that an integrated approach using adaptive laboratory techniques and co-culturing techniques is useful to discover potential molecules active against targeted pathogens. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={Background: Cognitive Radio Networks (CRN), one of the emerging technologies in the wireless communication domain, is primarily used for spectrum sensing and proper allocation of the unused licensed bands to the Secondary Users (SU) without producing any intervention to the Primary user (PU) in a dynamic manner. However, security to the physical layer becomes a major problem here. Security pressures in a cognitive radio network are taken into consideration. Method: The performance of the Primary User Emulation Attack (PUEA) from the Neyman-Pearson criterion's perspective has been analysed. In addition, the work also proposes an enhanced interference elimination method to diminish the interference between the cognitive users and others operating in the same wireless environment. Result: The results are plotted using MATLAB. Simulation results show improved interference cancellation between the cognitive user and primary user. Application: Data transfer to remote places utilizing the spectrum that remains idle or underutilized.},

abstract={Introduction: There have been given a much higher importance to employee commitment and retention since India is experiencing the highest attrition rate globally Economic Times, 20151. Hence, considering the factors of Person-job fit to interpret the impact towards work commitment is very well essential, especially in the current scenario. Work Commitment is a vital element in any organization which has outstanding impact on productivity and functioning and hence it is very much vital to have a committed workforce which is necessary in this competitive environment and tight labour market. In the same way, there is considerable amount of evidence that if P-J fit is high then it will have a direct impact on organization commitment also. Person-job fit is the compatibility between person's competency and abilities and the requirements of the job Zheng et al.2. If there exists a mismatch between person-job fit then the consequences might result in poor work commitment, low job satisfaction and extremely lower involvement in the job. Objective:This study analyzed the key factors that contribute to Person- job compatibility among IT workers and also analyzed the relationship and impact of Person- job compatibility towards work commitment. Methods: Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was used to filter the key factors initially, followed by a linear regression technique to determine the impact of Person- job compatibility factors in work commitment on a sample of 300 employees. EFA used Principal Component analysis for extraction and Promax for rotation. Finally regression analysis was carried out to predict the work commitment through statistically significant person-job compatibility variables. Results: The impact of person-job compatibility on work commitment was studied through regression analysis and it imply that for every unit increase in HR Policy, a 0.52(unstandardised coefficients) increase in work commitment is predicted and it has been turned out as a most impacting variable to predict work commitment. The coefficients for Relationship (B =.330, sig =.000), HR Policies (B =.519, sig =.000), Pay and Benefits (B =.386, sig =.000) and Employee Growth (B =.290, sig =.001) were statistically significant, since its p-value is .000 which is smaller than .05. The coefficients for Work Autonomy (B =.154, sig = .081) was not statistically significant, since its p-value is 0.081 which is greater than.05. Conclusion: The major factors responsible for creating work commitment among IT employees are Relationship, HR Policies and strategies, Pay and benefits, Work autonomy and Employee growth. The most contributing regressors which accounts for creating work commitment are HR policies, Pay and benefits, Employee growth and work autonomy.},

abstract={Albumin, a major plasma protein with extraordinary ligand binding properties, transports various ligands ranging from drugs, hormones, fatty acids, and toxins to different tissues and organs in the body. Albumin can undergo glycation on reacting with circulating reducing sugars, and this modification can occur even more frequently under hyperglycaemic conditions. Glycation is a non-enzymatic reaction of proteins and sugars, which gives rise to the formation of early and advanced glycation end products (AGEs). AGEs are a fundamental factor in the development and progression of severe diabetic complications such as nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy and cardiovascular disorders. The pathological impact of AGEs is mainly attributed to the structural modifications of proteins due to their cross-linking properties and the modification of lysine and arginine side chains. Herein, we review the structure-function effects of glycation on albumin, specifically focusing on its drug binding functions. Considering its physiological significance, there is a need to focus current research on determining the structure-function impacts of non-enzymatic glycation on serum albumin. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={With the tremendous growth in wireless technology there has been a shortage in the spectrum utilized for certain applications while some spectrum remains idle. To overcome this problem and for the efficient utilization of the spectrum cognitive radio is the suitable solution. Multiband OFDM can be easily modeled as cognitive radio, a technology that is employed for utilizing the available spectrum in the most efficient way. Since sensing of the free spectrum for detecting the arrival of the primary users is the foremost job of cognitive, here cyclostationary based spectrum sensing is carried out. Its performance is investigated using universal software defined radio peripheral (USRP) kit which is the hardware test bed for the cognitive radio system. Results are shown using Labview software. Further to mitigate the interference between the primary and cognitive users a modified intrusion elimination (AIC) algorithm had been proposed which in turn ensures the coexistence of both the users in the same wireless environment.

abstract={The surface plasmon resonance properties of copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) are rarely explored for colorimetric sensor applications. Herein, we demonstrated the CuNPs prepared with a stabilizing agent, N-lauryltyramine (NLTA) selectively induce a colorimetric response toward mercury(ii) ions from wine red to gray color at micromolar concentrations. The reported sensor system can detect Hg2+ in complex water bodies, which was proven through sensing Hg2+ in sewage water and also in the presence of interfering ions. The mechanism of sensing Hg2+ was through a galvanic displacement reaction. The as prepared CuNPs exhibited antibacterial activity by releasing copper ions from CuNPs, and we were interested in exploring the ability of NLTA capped CuNPs to prevent biofilm formation. Strikingly, the anti-biofilm activity of the CuNPs was not mediated by copper ion release and the minimum biofilm inhibitory concentration (MBIC) was observed to be much lower than the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), which implies that NLTA-CuNPs display a true anti-biofilm effect. At 0.5×MIC, CuNPs also displayed a remarkable 128 fold reversal in EtBr MIC and a drastic 256 fold reversal in ciprofloxacin MIC, implying an efflux pump inhibitory effect in E. coli. When tested against multidrug resistant (MDR) K. pneumoniae and A. baumanii, NLTA-CuNP displayed a remarkable 16 fold reversal in ciprofloxacin MIC validating its EPI effect against MDR Gram-negative bacteria. Mechanistic studies revealed that CuNPs alter the outer membrane permeability to retain an efflux inhibitory effect while displaying a true anti-biofilm effect. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.},

The established method was further extended to the synthesis of biologically important 3H-quinazolin-4-ones in good yields. For example, NPS 53574, a potent calcium receptor antagonist, was successfully synthesized by using this oxidative protocol.

Furthermore, the purified enzyme could effectively degrade 78 % of naphthol blue black under aerobic conditions, as monitored by UV-visible, FTIR-spectroscopy, HPLC and GCMS. Phytotoxicity and microbial toxicity assays showed that the degradation products of naphthol blue black were less toxic than the dye itself. © 2016, Chemical Publishing Co. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The scientists from across the world are studying the appearance of various precursors using ground and satellite based techniques. Continuous observation of anomalous thermal precursors like Outgoing long wave Radiation (OLR) is possible using satellite technology. These anomalous variations in the atmospheric parameters were observed several days before the occurrence of great earthquakes. In this paper the authors have analyzed OLR scenario prior to the earthquakes of Indian and neighbouring region earthquakes occurred recently in 2016. This is to identify the possible link between earthquake preparation zones and the anomalous variations in OLR scenario. From the results inference can be made that the anomalous OLR variations can effectively be used to identify the earthquake preparation zones. © 2016 CAFET-INNOVA TECHNICAL SOCIETY.

abstract={Agriculture sector in India is diminishing day by day which affects the production capacity of ecosystem. There is an exigent need to solve the problem in the domain to restore vibrancy and put it back on higher growth. The paper proposes an e-Agriculture Application based on the framework consisting of KM-Knowledge base and Monitoring modules. To make profitable decisions, farmers need information throughout the entire farming cycle. The required information is scattered in various places which includes real time information such as market prices and current production level stats along with the available primary crop knowledge. A knowledge dataflow model is constructed connecting various scattered sources to the crop structures. The world around is getting automated replacing manual procedures with the advancement of technology, since it is energy efficient and engross minimal man power. The paper proposes the advantages of having ICT in Indian agricultural sector, which shows the path for rural farmers to replace some of the conventional techniques. Monitoring modules are demonstrated using various sensors for which the inputs are fed from Knowledge base. A prototype of the mechanism is carried out using TI CC3200 Launchpad interconnected sensors modules with other necessary electronic devices. A comparative study is made between the developed system and the existing systems. The system overcomes limitations of traditional agricultural procedures by utilizing water resource efficiently and also reducing labour cost. © 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Hypertension is the gift of modern life due to change in food habit and reduced physical activities. According to Siddha literatures hypertension is termed as ‘Kurithi azhal noi’. The causative factors, symptoms and medicinal remedies for hypertension were explained detail in the Siddha literature. Drugs for hypertension are many and usually the treatment is life-long. Hence research is going on to find out a suitable & safe drug. Herbal products in this regard are worthy of investigation. Even though several Siddha literatures are available about the usage of various herbals in the management of hypertension in South India, the information are scattered and hence there is a lack of knowledge on their utility. Hence this present article focused on the herbals which are used in Siddha system of medicine to manage hypertension in Tamil Nadu region with scientific evidences. In Siddha system of medicine, more than 60 medicinal plants are used to treat hypertension and prevent/control blood pressure.

abstract={Objective: The enhancement of wireless technology and sensory device has brought to the introduction towards IoT (Internet of Things). Here security is taken as one of the major issues, as they operate in unlicensed bandwidth. Since most of the device is resource constrained the lightweight security is driven to these devices. Implementation of security is also tedious and selective as the conventional security algorithm degrades the network performance due to the high computational complexity and inherent delays that are incurred for execution of these algorithms. Method: In this work, a novel approach is made with new hybrid lightweight security algorithm named PRESENT-GRP which is derived in Intel Galileo Gen 2 board. This methodology helps to secure data during transmission and control process. Findings: This hybrid algorithm is an enhancement of the GRP permutation algorithm because it lags an S-box. This proposed algorithm is for low power devices which consumes relatively less memory. Thus, in Internet of Things (IoT) applications this algorithm may help to provide end to end privacy to share data securely. Improvement: In future works, this algorithm can be improved with still more security level by having a trade offbetween performance and memory usage. It can also be enhanced by implementing it in real time military related and health related applications for end to end security for smaller size datum.},

abstract={Sigma delta ADC is mainly used in resolution based application. But the gain of the sigma delta modulator is low. The main objective of the paper is to design the comparator with high gain. Comparator with low gain cannot drive the load effectively through the entire circuit. This paper was designed and simulated using 180 nm process technology (GPDK 180 nm library) in CADENCE Virtuoso Analog Design Environment. In sigma delta ADC, each block should drive the load effectively to the entire circuit. So that the output will come accurately and delay will be less. Based on that concept, need to design the comparator that can be used in sigma delta ADC. In this point of view, some comparators are analysed. In this paper, analyse the performance of regenerative comparators and op-amp based comparators. And find which will efficient comparator for using at sigma delta modulator. Dynamic comparator, double tail comparator, modified double tail comparator are analysed. The gain of these operational amplifiers are low. So high gain based operational amplifier should be designed. For that, first one op-amp was designed which has 84 dB gain. Using this opamp, one comparator was designed. This comparator has high gain. So it can be used for sigma delta ADC for drive the load. And also it meets certain other constraints like speed and moderate power.},

LFSR Reseeding is the method which is mainly used in logic BIST. Some of the reseeding mechanism needs some sort of memory to store all seeds. But this issue is overcome by present method. By this method, the proposed test pattern generator employs the output response of the CUT to the LFSR as the controlling signal to transform the LFSR state. It contains a net providing cell and LFSR with reversal logic to conform that there is no storage of seeds. When compared to previous methods, by using this approach (SIM), the test sequence that will have been given to LFSR is much reducing. The empirical outcome on ISCAS circuits shows that the conferred seed initialization method has brought reduced area overhead.},

abstract={A competent architecture for IIR filter is designed. It is configured and folded, which will be used in the real time applications like loud speaker and equalization of digital signal processing. A basic feature of digital signal processing is filtering. Filtering is a choosy system which passes an assured choice of frequency and attenuating the others frequency. Digital filtering is a prevailing sector of DSP allied works. A system of digital filter performs mathematical operations on a sampled or discrete time variant signal to contract or improve certain aspects of that signal. The configurable folded IIR filter for sixth order is designed using three series of second order IIR filter. This IIR filter architecture is used to cany out three second order or a one sixth order. It can be also used to execute one fourth order and one second order in parallel according to the requirement where, each second order IIR filter is designed using multiply accumulate circuit which as floating point. Here pipelining of IIR filter for second order is proposed to increase the throughput by reducing the critical path delay. The proposed sixth order IIR filter using three second order IIR filter with pipelining achieves 39.7% of increased throughput and it operates at high frequency of 85.068MHz compared with conventional MAC based architecture.},

In the 2bit and 3-bit BCSE algorithms, shift and add method was proposed. Those provide less area than the normal multiplier. Hence algorithm is proposed to further reduce the area utilization, power consumption. Area is utilized by reducing the number of gates in the architecture. This algorithm used for implementing higher adder filters with very few adders and few stages. The proposed algorithm is used to multiply both the signed and unsigned constant multiplication. Here the adjacent co-efficient are grouped by 2bit, 4bit and 8bit grouping as per the horizontal and vertical common sub-expressions. The Shift and add method is used to reduce the number of adders. Similarly multiplexers are used for switching activity to reduce the adders and multiplication stages. These operations are applied to the RRC FIR filter with the different standards.

There is a need to reduce the consumption of powerand to write energy of flip-flop. Hence, we propose a design of low power normal flip-flop using modified CMOS technology. CMOS technology provides less noise ration during design. The proposed flip-flop design is based on MOS technology. Data store and restore operations can be performed.

In the advanced mechanisms of cache memories are most applicable components, because the soft errors are protected. The identical tag bit data is used to regain from the error in the tag bits. In this paper, to improve error protection capacity of the tag bits in caches, power efficient cache design is proposed by using Superlative Standard Techniques (SST) architecture to achieve power. To utilize the identical tag bits for transitory error protection, the proposed scheme is discussed by selecting the energy superlative standard techniques that decrease unwanted interior activities by reducing the dynamic switching power. In experimental method, results show that our proposed multilevel cache architecture sustains a performance of achieving dynamic power and reduces the power consumption up to 85% when applied to energy optimal technique.},

abstract={In this paper, we present a new type of odd integer divider topology which consume low power and it uses Mod-N counter, DFF and OR gate. In existing methodology divide by 2 topologies involves only D Flip-Flops (DFF), which realized mostly Common Mode Logic DFF (CML) or True Single Phase Clock (TSPC) based DFF. These were high-speed dividers but no flexibility in this topology i.e. it divides the only power of N. So the proposed divider gives more flexibility to the topology like divided by any real odd integer. While designing a new topology the limitations are operating frequency range, a number of transistor and power consumption. Based on this consideration the 3T NAND and TSPC based Flip-Flop are investigated. The maximum operating frequency of the TSPC divide by 2 is reaches at 2.4 GHz with 1.1931 mw power consumption and is 50% low power consumption compared to the NAND_DFF based frequency divider. Similarly, divide by 3, divide by 5 and divide by 7 also consume low power with less number of transistor compare to the NAND_DFF based frequency divider. So the results show the TSPC is DFF's more preferable for PLL application and RFIC. The TSPC_DFF based frequency divider designed using 0.18 urn CMOS process technology.},

As application is becoming complex they require good design for greater bandwidth and performance which lead to 3D NoC. 3D NoC provide best solutions to connect as many functional elements on-chip over 2D NoC. Data flow NoCs can be categorized into: packet switched and circuit switched NoCs. The paper focus on simultaneous circuit and packet switching to benefit from two methods which ensures low latency and more resource utilization. Here in this paper, the circuit switched NoC is much concentrated where we implement our ideas in area like circuit setup method. Here we bring in a new method for guaranteed Quality of Service (QoS) known an efficient path establishment mechanism in circuit switching in 3D Torus topology. Torus topology aims to produce less latency of other topologies, where the path is estimated based on to the destination node layers and position. This paper is more advantageous where it can get switched between to different layers and position in which destination is placed. As of 3D NoC with increased number of nodes it ensureslow power, low latency, increase hardware integration, improved throughput and enables multi core processing and also resolves scalability crisis. It can operate on both packet and circuit switching which reduces both cost and operational expenses. Analysis on latency, power and throughput is made for 3D hybrid integration which provides better solutions. Optic Communication can be extended for future progress for improved speed and accuracy.},

abstract={SRAMs are important building blocks in many digital applications, such as microprocessors and cache memories. Decoders are the significant components in SRAMs. Address decoder is vital part of SRAM memory. Choice of capacity cell and read operation is relies on upon decoder. Henceforth, execution of SRAM is relies on upon these parts. This work studies the location decoder for SRAM memory, focusing on deferral streamlining and control effective circuit systems. We have focused on ideal decoder structure with slightest number of transistors to diminish range of SRAM. Usually, in Memory Chip, it consumes almost fifty percent of the total chip access time and power. Parameters which has to be considered while designing an address decoders are, first appropriate circuit technique has to be chosen and the second thing is sizing constrains of the transistors. Modified hybrid type of decoding topology is illustrated and it is compared with traditional type decoders which include both static and dynamic types using 180 nm CMOS technology in Cadence Virtuoso environment.},

abstract={Among any testing methods, scan testing is very significant for both in built and external schemes. The performance of the system should get maintained so the throughput plays major role. This paper tells about the retaining data which is hold technique and the jump process is attached to improve the throughput in VLSI testing. In order to achieve better performance the throughput is achieved by transferring the data per time and this gets increased constantly. The data in the partitions shifted sequentially when scan condition is on and when it is offthe data may get corrupted so the system invalidate the testing process, the loss may get increase. In-order to solve the problem the data should get retained when the scan condition is not activated and to this process the jump technique is connected. The jump process connects to the output port when the condition is off. When compared to the first stage hold process this multiple partitions is beneficial. The implemented technique helps for the priority data, data rate and also to increase the throughput value approximately 85% to 87% as the clock frequency get reduced in the testing side. The area is reduced by 23.01% with the help of ISCAS benchmark circuit S5 3 78when compared to the first stage hold technique where the benchmark helps to test the system.},

abstract={Network on-Chip (NoC) is a novel technology which is used to make the interconnections between the components available in the System on Chip (SoC) design. This technology of NoC is defined and used in two varied forms as buffered and bufferless NoC. Bufferless NoC, a predominant type of network on chip, is used to reduce the cost efficiently by removing input buffers of the router. However, it is evident that this performance gets jammed at high loads because of the increase in the network contentions and deflection of packets in huge amount. To reduce the amount of deflection and to buttress the flow, Clumsy Flow Control (CFC) is used in the bufferless NoC. In this paper, a novel proposal has been propounded into the pipelining mechanism keeping in mind the flawless flow control needed for the bufferless NoC to decrease the impact of deflection routing and to increase the throughput with high injection rate. Employing the pipelining technique into the existing flow control increases the frequency which in turn, is responsible for high throughput. Implementation of the aforementioned pipelining mechanism is done in two stages in the bufferless NoC which helps to increase the throughput as well as the injection rate. Finally, the application with its pipelined implementation, as proposed, will be mapped onto the NoC architecture by using the CFC.},

abstract={This paper presents about the partially parallel encoder and decoder architecture for polar-codes using register-free technique. In this paper, the folding transformation technique and register minimization technique are used for this architecture to reduce the circuit and timing complexity. In general, the polar codes are referred to a low complexity code to achieve the performance of channel carrying capacity in a binary-input memory-less channels. In the fully-parallel architecture, the hardware complexity is the major drawback which is high whereas in partially-parallel architecture the memory-sharing concept is utilized to overcome the complexity of hardware to attain the high throughput application. Thus, the temporary end results are saved within the registers instead of memories and multiplexers to manage the interlocking wires. Hence, the register aspect in polar code centered encoder and decoder architecture are eliminated. In an effort to support the information transmission efficiency stage, we get rid of the knowledge storage side (d-register) in stage-three and stage-four encoder and decoder method. Finally we reduce the 32 register elements for every data transmission process and mainly focus on the data storage and transmit function. Because the storage events are need to more time for data passing to one stage level to another stage.},

abstract={The main objective of the paper is to improve the throughput and increase the speed of the XTEA (Extended Tiny Encryption Algorithm) which is one of the cryptographic algorithms. The technique used to improve the throughput is parallel processing. In previous, they have used pipelining which increases the overhead that is not desirable. The error detection scheme employed in this paper is RERO (Recomputing with Rotated Operand). The previous error detection REPO (Recomputing with Permuted Operands) occupies more memory than RERO. The embedded systems have been developing with many sensitive nodes like Nano-sensors. Radio Frequency Identification tags, etc. As these systems have many constraints, the required security is given by the light weight block ciphers like PRESENT, XTEA and SIMON. These block ciphers are more suitable for these embedded systems when compared to Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). Providing security alone does not give assurance for their reliability while these architectures are liable to malicious and natural faults. Due to hardware failures, various types of faults occur while implementing in hardware. To overcome this, there are many schemes for error detection that can be applied to these ciphers. One of the error detection schemes is RERO (Recomputing with Rotated Operands). Through RERO, error coverage is achieved high. Parallel processing is applied to the XTEA algorithm to increase the throughput. The two halves that are used in the XTEA algorithm are executed at the same time through the parallel processing. Finally, this algorithm is implemented in the Altera FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array). The throughput is increased by 60% when compared to previous systems that use sub pipelining. This type of structure finds its application in low resource embedded systems having sensitive nodes like RFID tags and Nano sensors.},

abstract={The channel scaling attains the overflow current at the transistor, which impacts on power indulgence. In order to attain reduced power and delay, the devices are assumed to decrease its size. Then transistors size can also be changed. In this paper the unique dynamic isolated read SRAM has been projected for dropping the total power. By linking, the cell with 6T and NC SRAM in numerous features, high constancy and decreased power is achieved by the curvature N (noise) method, which is done when the system is in active mode. The values are calculated with the voltage of 1.8 which reduces 90% of power than the 6T, and 18% of power is reduced than the 8T SRAM cell, and 30% of leakage current is reduced as compared to 6T cell. Thus when related to the existing SRAM, the cell consumes less power and without any distortion the cell stores the data. Also the constancy of the cell is improved when compared with the other cell. The waveform result shows that the cell attains enhanced stability and reduction in overflow using the cadence virtuoso technology of 180 nm.},

abstract={Background: Digital multipliers, the most important part which is used to implement most of the digital processing and arithmetic applications such as Filters, FFT's, etc. As the rapid developments in technology required, many researchers are going to design multipliers which offers an efficient design aspect with respect to the speed and power consumption. Statistical analysis: Multipliers are the key functional units in various applications. The transistor speed is reduced due to bias temperature instability effects. When this effect extends in distant future, the system may not work properly due to timing infraction. Findings: The overall performance of these systems depends on the multiplier's throughput. The Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI) effect occurs when a pMOS transistor is under negative bias (Vgs = -Vdd), which results the increase in the threshold voltage of the pMOS transistor, hence the delay in the multiplier is increased. In the same way, positive bias temperature instability, occurs when an nMOS transistor is under positive bias. Both the temperature effects decrease the transistor speed, in the long run, the system may fail due to timing violations. Usually consummation of a system depends on the throughput of the multiplier. So it is important to adopt a reliable high performance multiplier. The multiplier is able to attenuate the performance degradation due to aging. Improvement: Hence, the objective of the project is to design a high speed and power efficient multiplier to increase the performance of the device. Design of Multiplier circuit using Adaptive Hold Technique is proposed. By using AHT circuit we can reduce the NBTI andPositive Bias Temperature Instability(PBTI) effects, hence performance will be increased and the aging effects will be reduced. The proposed technique is done using Xilinx 14.7 tool. The code is simulated and synthesized and comparison results are made based on the performance of the multipliers with and without AHT.},

abstract={Wave Pipelining has been used in order to reduce the area without degrading its performance and also to improve the speed. In pipelining the throughput is achieved with the compensation of area and the critical path will be same as the original architecture. While considering of larger circuits the area places an important role where the cost is a major issue. Hence in order to reduce the area the latches are removed which produces the technique of wave pipelining. The concept of Wave Pipelining optimize the area and speed when compared to the pipelining architectures. Thus the Wave Pipelining is applied in the FFT architecture for achieving less area. The FFT pipelined architecture is based on splitting the architecture by stages. Each stage is evaluated with effective structure. It's noted that by using the internal clock which increases both speed and reduces clock loads the number of gates used in the pipelined structure is reduced in using wave pipelining. The Wave Pipelining technique have to be implemented in a 32-bit FFT Pipelined architecture which is suitable for a digital sig- nal processing applications for image processing and for conversion of frequency domain to time domain.

Conventionally, two stage op-amps are used which requires higher power with comparatively low gain. In order to overcome this, operation of devices in sub-threshold region is carried out which requires low power comparatively. Initially, the design of conventional Op-amp is designed using CADENCE Virtuoso tool GPDK 180nm with a supply voltage of 1.8V and the corresponding gain, phase margin, power of the conventional Op-amp is observed and then, Op-amp with transistors operating in sub threshold region is designed using CADENCE Virtuoso tool GPDK 180nm with a supply voltage of 1.8V and the corresponding gain, phase margin, power is observed.

abstract={This paper proposes enhanced parallel adder architectures with low power and reduced area. It includes, design of three different parallel adders such as Ripple Carry Adder (RCA), Carry Look ahead Adder (CLA) and Carry Select Adder (CSA). All three adders are designed in Gate Diffusion Interface (GDI) technique as well as traditional CMOS method. Adder is a basic common combinational digital circuit. Adders are important components in signal processing, image and video processing applications. So it is essential to have compact, low power adder design for these application fields. GDI based digital sys- tem design offers reduction in power consumption and area over head. When compared to traditional CMOS based design, GDI uses very less transistor to implement a function. The GDI and CMOS methods are taken in to account for the compari- son of design parameters such as design layout, node to node delay, total power dissipation and speed of operation. All three parallel adders are designed in traditional CMOS as well as GDI method. The simulations are done using Microwind2 and DSCH2 analysis software tools and the results between those two types are listed below. This proposed adder cir- cuits can be used in all high speed multipliers and filter designs where low power and reduced area is a major concern.},

abstract={The quest for the improvement of processing power and efficiency is spawning research for many core systems. Network on chip (Noc) is evolving as an eminent way in replacing shared buses for better design and reusability. The packet switch fabric posses a high dominant problem which gives rise to high latency and communication uncertainty. Packet requirements can be detected and dispatched from different directions based on the priorities so that the packets pass through the router in a congestion free manner. Network on chip replaces the shared bus system and routing is performed in a multi hop basis. Router architectures have been proposed to reduce the average network delay. However communication uncertainty becomes more critical to system performance. Pipelining stage can further increase the throughput as much as possible. A priority arbitration technique is used in this paper to reduce the average latency by Dynamic priority based matrix arbiter in the pipelining stage. If many packets want to get access to the same output channel, the role of router is to decide which packet should be delivered to the next router. The scheduling algorithm is implemented with the matrix arbitration technique in the pipelining stage which increases the speed of communication. With the help of the tool Xilinx ISE 14.2 the parameters of throughput and latency is analyzed.},

abstract={Objectives: A 16-bit cany look ahead adder is implemented in domino CMOS logic is presented in this paper. The proposed work comprises of two separate 8-bit carry chains. Statistical Analysis: This is evaluated using TANNER EDA tool. The schematics are drawn in s-edit, netlists are generated using T-spice and the waveforms are verified using waveform viewer or w-edit. Layouts can also be created using SDL (Schematic Drawn Layout), by importing netlist in L-edit. Findings: Due to the split carry chains in the adder, the speed of computation is increased, at the cost of area, when compared with ordinary carry look ahead adder. As we know that the use of domino logic reduces the power consumption, but as switching occurs many times power consumption is increased, that is the switching power of the system is increased. Applications: In VLSI system reducing the multipliers and increasing the adders is the main factor, thus in place of those adders if this split carry adders are used, the speed will be increased further.},

abstract={These days, power system planners are looking for ways to reduce emission from power generating stations especially coal based thermal power plants without compromising the load factor. The economic dispatch problem allocates units for a given load without considering its emission. The present paper proposes a multi-objective optimization method, which uses Artificial Immune System based Clonal Selection Algorithm to solve problems related to emissions and economic dispatch along with unit commitment of generators in a thermal power system. A penalty factor has been imposed for violating the critical emission limits which is subject to the impact it causes on the environment. An 'Artificial Immune System' based Clonal Selection principle is used to select a suitable generator from a pool of generator units. Fitness has been evaluated for the proliferated units. Emission constrained Economic Dispatch problem involves power demand equality and inequality constraints under various operating conditions. Finally, the best units are selected and committed for a given load. The 'Clonal Selection' method has been compared with Non-Dominated Ranked Genetic Algorithm (NGDA) and Clonal Algorithms to prove its robustness and superior optimal selection. To understand the proposed method, a IEEE -30 bus 6 unit test system (with and without load uncertainty) is considered for solving the EED problem using MATLAB simulation and results are compared. © 2006-2016 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).},

abstract={Glass Fiber Reinforced Plastics (GFRP) composite is considered to be an economic alternative to various heavy exotic materials. It is widely used in a variety of applications from aircraft to machine tools due to their light weight, high modulus, specific strength and high fracture toughness. The machining of composite is different from the conventional machining of metal due to the composite's anisotropic and non-homogeneous nature. This paper discusses the application of the Taguchi method with fuzzy logic to optimize the machining parameters for machining of GFRP composites with multiple characteristics. A multi-response performance index (MRPI) was used for optimization. The machining parameters viz., Tool geometry (helix angle of the end mill cutter), spindle speed, feed rate, depth of cut and work piece (fiber orientation), were Optimized with consideration of multiple performance characteristics viz., machining force, delamination, surface roughness and material removal rate. The results from confirmation runs indicated that the determined optimal combination of machining parameters improved the performance of the machining process. © 2016-IOS Press and the authors.},

abstract={This paper illustrates how Meena Alexander explores the prospect of outgrowing the sense of rootlessness of Asian immigrants in America in Manhattan Music. According to her it is managed by vocational and social engagements, and bonding with fellow expatriates. Alienation, search for identity and emotional insecurity of immigrants have hitherto been the dominant themes of diasporic literature. However, in the context of globalisation the concept of 'home' as a giver of emotional security cries for a redefinition. Meena Alexander's Manhattan Music analyses the impact of transplantation from natal to post-marital space in the lives of women characters. Sandhya Rosenblum, Draupadi Dinkins, Sakhi and a few others despite the differences in their upbringing, experience the trauma of dislocation at first, but outgrow the same. Sandhya wrestles between her conflicting roles, a mother in New York and a daughter revisiting India, and in neither does she feel at home. But after her recovery from the shock of suicide, she escapes from racial thinking. It constitutes a rebirth of self for her. Similarly, Draupadi, the alter-ego of Sandhya, comes to realise being an American is only a part of her Self. Meena Alexander's central vision in all her writings is the need of the immigrants for adapting themselves to the changed environment to find meaning in their lives. In Manhattan Music, the writer emphasises this idea by portraying Sandhya's inner conflict in her adopted country at first and later her awakening to the truth that we all have several "homes" or as Homi Bhabha suggests we have to "desire for social solidarity: I am looking for the join...I want to join...I want to join."

abstract={Network on Chip (NoC) reduces the communication delay of System on Chip (SoC). The main limitation of NoC is power consumption and area overhead. Bufferless NoC reduces the area complexity and power consumption by eliminating buffers in the traditional routers. The bufferless NoC design should include live lock freeness since they use hot potato routing. This increases the complexity of bufferless NoC design. Among the available propositions to reduce this complexity, CHIPPER based bufferless NoC is considered as one of the best options. Live lock freeness is provided in CHIPPER through golden epoch and golden packet. All routers follow some synchronization method to identify a golden packet. Clock based method is intuitively followed for synchronization in CHIPPER based NoCs. It is shown in this work that the worst-case latency of packets is unbearably high when the above synchronization is followed. To alleviate this problem, broadcast bus NoC (BBus NoC) approach is proposed in this work. The proposed method decreases the worst-case latency of packets by increasing the golden epoch rate of CHIPPER. © 2016 D. Muralidharan and R. Muthaiah.},

abstract={Scutellaria oblonga Benth., a hitherto phytochemically unexplored Indian medicinal folklore plant was extracted with acetone and subjected to chromatography to yield nine flavonoids, for the first time from this plant. Antimicrobial assays were performed against 11 foodborne pathogens, and three molecules (Techtochrysin, Negletein and Quercitin-3-glucoside) depicted significant activity. These molecules were assessed for their rate of antibacterial action using time–kill curves which depicted complete inhibition of most of the bacteria within 12–16 h. The significant biofilm-reducing capability exhibited by these three molecules formed a significant finding of the current study. In most of the experiments, a 90–95% reduction in biofilms was observed. Thus, flavonoids as natural molecules from S. oblonga could be further researched to be used as potent antimicrobial and antibiofilm agents. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Dental caries occur as a result of disequilibrium between acid producing pathogenic bacteria and alkali generating commensal bacteria within a dental biofilm (dental plaque). Streptococcus mutans has been reported as a primary cariogenic pathogen associated with dental caries. Emergence of multidrug resistant as well as fluoride resistant strains of S. mutans due to over use of various antibiotics are a rising problem and prompted the researchers worldwide to search for alternative therapies. In this perspective, the present study was aimed to screen selective inhibitors against ComA, a bacteriocin associated ABC transporter, involved in the quorum sensing of S. mutans. In light of our present in silico findings, 1,3-disubstituted urea derivatives which had better affinity to ComA were chemically synthesized in the present study for in vitro evaluation of S. mutans biofilm inhibition. The results revealed that 1,3-disubstituted urea derivatives showed good biofilm inhibition. In addition, synthesized compounds exhibited potent synergy with a very low concentration of fluoride (31.25-62.5 ppm) in inhibiting the biofilm formation of S. mutans without affecting the bacterial growth. Further, the results were supported by confocal laser scanning microscopy. On the whole, from our experimental results we conclude that the combinatorial application of fluoride and disubstituted ureas has a potential synergistic effect which has a promising approach in combating multidrug resistant and fluoride resistant S. mutans in dental caries management. © 2016 Kaur, Balamurugan, Uma Maheswari, Anitha and Princy.},

abstract={Tourism has always been one of the most important elements of pleasure for human beings. While planning tours, people usually concentrate only on the mode of transportation and not on the service offered by the transportation. Hence, if one does not give importance to the service quality, one would have to experience a terrible travel. This paper deals with a number of transport services for selected tourist destinations from a particular source. The attributes, which validate a transport service, were collected from various travel websites and the set of important attributes were chosen by feature selection using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method. Then, the transport services for each selected tourist destination were ranked based on the selected attributes using crisp and fuzzy ranking methods. Finally, the transport services in which each of its attributes were given equal importance were determined using Simpson's Diversity Index (SDI). Evenness is the term that is used to denote the 'equal importance' factor. SDI is the best approach to determine this evenness in any ranking method. © 2006-2016 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).},

abstract={Melanoma causes majority of deaths related to skin cancer if not detected and treated at an early stage. It is considered as one of the dangerous types of cancer, since it quickly spreads to other parts. A novel approach has been proposed in this paper to detect Melanoma from dermoscopic images. Pre-processing is done to remove hair and noise in the image. Initial segmentation is carried out with watershed transform. This is followed by Maximal Similarity Region Merging process. After pre-processing and segmentation, wavelet-based energy features are extracted using daubechies (DB3), and reverse biorthogonal (RBIO3.3, RBIO3.5, and RBIO3.7) wavelet filters. 12 features are extracted using four wavelet filters. Using the Gain Ratio feature selection method, the most discriminative six features are selected for the classification purpose. Then classification has been done by using K-nearest neighbour, support vector machine, random forest, and Naïve Bayes classifier. The highest sensitivity of 97.5% is achieved in the case of support vector machine. Copyright © 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={The objective of this paper is to establish the temperature distributions in plasma sprayed Yttria Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) and magnesia stabilized zirconia (MgZrO3) thermal barrier coating on an aluminum alloy piston crown to raise the potential of a diesel engine. The influence of ceramic coating thickness on temperature variations are studied by finite element method using ANSYS. The temperature distribution analyses were conducted for the ceramic coating thickness of 0.3mm over the piston crown surface. The results of the piston coated with two different coatings were analyzed. It is observed that, the peak exterior surface temperature of the ceramic piston with the material MgZrO3 is increased by 32% and 20% for the piston coated with yttria stabilized zirconia compared with conventional aluminum alloy piston. It is concluded that the substrate temperature of the piston coated with MgZrO3 and yttria stabilized zirconia is reduced by 25% and 17% compared with uncoated aluminum alloy piston. The lower substrate surface temperature by coating results in improved heat to work conversion efficiency of the engine.},

abstract={Acetyl shikonin (AS), a naphthoquinone isolated from Arnebia nobilis, was tested against visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in this study. AS induced anti-VL activity was examined for a number of intracellular amastigotes in Giemsa-stained BALB/C derived macrophages in vitro and hepatic-splenic parasite burden by the stamp smear method in vivo. Mediators of AS induced anti-VL were studied by analysis of nitrites and reactive oxygen species (ROS) and were further confirmed using their inhibitors. The effect of AS on interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-10 was analyzed by ELISA and RT-PCR for infected macrophages. AS treatment caused a nitrite and ROS mediated decrease in the parasite load in murine infected macrophages. These events are associated with the up-regulation of IL-12 and down-regulation of IL-10. In addition, AS was efficient for decreasing the hepatic and splenic parasite load and modulated the IL-12 and IL-10 ratio in splenocytes. In summary, this study revealed that AS provides a chemo-immunotherapeutic strategy against visceral leishmaniasis. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={The application of hedging rules in reservoir operation has been established as one of the important advances in the field of reservoir operation studies during the past three decades. Hedging rules distribute the deficits over a longer duration to minimize the impact of deficits. Thus, hedging provides the insurance of highvalued water uses, where reservoirs experience uncertain inflows. Formulating different forms of hedging rules and proposing appropriate objective functions that adequately describe the trade-off among the operational performance indicators have been attempted for water supply and irrigation release from reservoirs. Research on hedging rule-based operation of reservoirs for hydro-power generation has not yet gained sufficient attention, probably due to its complexity due to non-linearity. In this study, hedging rules are formulated for Indira Sagar reservoir for hydro-power generation. Discrete phased hedging rule and two point linear hedging rule are developed and demonstrated in this research. While the two-point linear hedging rule is one of the simple hedging rules, the discrete phased hedging rule is a more realistic rule as it will facilitate better planning of alternative sources of power generation or rationing. The results indicate the advantages of applying the hedging rules over the standard operating policy. © 2016 JUST. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={Biofilm, the regulated complex behavior of bacteria pose serious threat to medical device associated infections and resist the action of antibacterial agents. Also, researchers have evidenced the chemical and physical properties of the non-biological surfaces that enhance the matrix-enclosed microbial accretions on them. In this context, it is a need of an hour to improve the non-adhesive nature of the medical devices against the adherence of microbial populations. So, in our present study, we have developed biocompatible coatings with TiO2-Ag thin film on stainless steel substrate (SS 304L) using DC reactive magnetron sputtering and Ag is doped by thermal evaporation technique. The XRD result indicates the formation of anatase TiO2 films. FE-SEM micrograph showed the uniform deposition of nano-sized Ag and TiO2 particles. Annealed TiO2 film showed hydrophobic property and TiO2-Ag films showed hydrophilic property. Further, the improved material, TiO2-Ag thin films were also tested for its antibacterial and anti-biofilm properties. The data revealed significant reduction of bacterial counts and impairment of Staphylococcus aureus (S.aureus) biofilm in TiO2-Ag thin films when compared to SS 304L. Our results provide an insight onto a new perspective for the wide application of these thin film coatings on surgical tools, implant materials etc. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={This paper scrutinizes the authentication and key agreement protocol adopted by the Universal Mobile Telecommunication System to meet the standards of a fourth-generation network. Lately, communication of multimedia (CoM) has drawn the attention of researchers for the future of secure wireless mobile communication. However, the CoM has not had any defensive mechanism to fulfil the specifications of 3GPP and reduce the computation and communication overheads and susceptible attacks like redirection, man-in-the-middle, and denial of service attacks. In addition, this paper has thoroughly investigated some existing protocols from the literature for the identification of new challenges in server-client authentication. To probe the challenges of the existing schemes realistically, the multimedia client and multimedia server components (proxy, interrogating, serving, and home subscriber server) were physically deployed on the Linux platform to examine the specifications of 3GPP, vulnerable attacks, computation, and communication overheads. We observed that the examined existing schemes are not able to fulfill the above criteria. We thus propose addition of the mutual authenticated session key (MASK) to the physical environment of the multimedia server-client. To satisfy the 3GPP specifications, the protocol of MASK offers mutual authenticity to the multimedia server-client. Moreover, the feature of mutual authenticity reduces the computation and communication overheads of the multimedia server-client. Since the session keys are jointly shared between the multimedia server and client, the protocol of MASK can additionally provide privacy preservation and forward secrecy. © 2016 Tübitak.},

abstract={Concrete is the material of choice where strength, performance, durability, impermeability, fire resistance and abrasion resistance are required. The hunger for the higher strength leads to other materials to achieve the desired results and thus emerged the contribution of cementitious material for the strength of concrete. Addition of pozzolonic admixture like the pulverized Fly ash (PFA)contributes to the improvement of strength and also by adding the Nano materials, concrete composites with superior properties can be produced. Nano Technology applied to concrete includes the use of Nano materials like Nanosilica, Nano fibers etc. The micro-level does not provide enough insights into building materials. Therefore, all around the world, increasing amounts of research funding are being diverted into the Nano level, which is claimed to have tremendous potential for the future. Nano-silica improves the microstructure by making it denser. The objective of this project is to study the mechanical and microstructural properties of M60 high performance concrete with Nano-silica as admixture partially replacing cement in 1%, 2%, 3% and 4%. Specimens namely cubes, cylinders and prism are cured for 14 days in standard environment, after this curing period test to analyze the mechanical properties are carried out. Compressive test, Split tensile test, Flexural test and test for Modulus of elasticity are carried out to study the mechanical properties. The mechanical properties start showing increasing trend with increase in the quantity of Nano-silica. TEM, EDS and SEM techniques are used to study the microstructure of the concrete. The Nano-silica addition reduces the pore amount and makes the concrete denser in microstructure level which in turn increases the mechanical properties. © 2016, Sphinx Knowledge House.

abstract={Concrete is that pourable mix of cement, water, sand, and gravel that hardens into a super-strong building material. Supplementary cementing materials (SCM) have become an integral part of concrete mix design. These may be naturally occurring materials, industrial wastes or, by products or the ones requiring less energy to manufacture. Some of the commonly used SCM are fly ash, silica fume (SF), GGBS, rice husk ash and metakaolin (MK), etc. Metakaolin is obtained by the calcination of kaolinite. It is being used very commonly as pozzolanic material and has exhibited considerable influence in enhancing the mechanical and durability properties of concrete. M-sand is crushed aggregates produced from hard granite stone which is cubically shaped with grounded edges, washed and graded with consistency to be used as a substitute of river sand. Usage of M-Sand can overcome the defects occurring in concrete such as honey combing, segregation, voids, capillary, etc. In this project, experimental study was carried out on M-30 grade of concrete. In this concrete mixes sand was replaced by M-sand by a constant percentage and cement was replaced by metakolin in various percentages such as 5%, 10%, 15% and 20%. Concrete specimens containing metakaolin were studied for their compressive, split tensile and flexural strengths according to Bureau of Indian standards. The results thus obtained were compared and examined with respect to the control specimen. From the test results, it was found that 15% of the Ordinary Portland cement could be beneficially replaced with themetakaolin to improve compressive, split tensile and flexural strengths of concrete. © 2016, Sphinx Knowledge House.

abstract={Corrosion can also occur in materials other than metals, such as ceramics or polymers, and it degrades the useful properties of meterials and structures including strength, appearance and permeability to liquids and gases. Corrosion from civil engineering point of view is wearing of metals due to chemical changes. Due to the gradual wearing away of material, the resistance capacity of materials decreases. In many structures the effects of corrosion are seen clearly. In case of offshore structures this effect is predominant. The adverse effects of corrosion increase with the increase in number of days of exposure of materials to the environment. Generally these effects of corrosion are controlled by painting, plating, galvanization, anodization, bio-film coatings, etc. In the present work an attempt was made to study the corrosion inhibition property by using a material called water hyacinth. © 2016, Sphinx Knowledge House.

The electronic properties were studied in terms of HOMO-LUMO and density of state spectra. It divulges that the band gap has shrunk appreciably due to the addition of nitraso and thio functional groups upon the p-Py structure. The variation in the band gap is may be due the half filled 2S orbit of nitrogen atoms in the p-Py structure. Vibrational spectra reveals that there is a shift in the frequency towards the lower region. This may be due to the addition of functional groups in p-Py structure and they are identified due to molecular stretching. Transport properties of p-Py and F-Py are studied by constructing nano devices showed an appreciable hike in current variation from nano amperes to milli amperes by the addition of functional groups.

abstract={With the rapid development of information technology, multimedia data are transmitted through digital media. Always the transmission media is not secure. Hence there is a need to protect the information during transmission. To transmit the image information in a secured way, digital image watermarking is one of the best data hiding technique. In image watermarking technique there is a chance to destroy the information intentionally or uinintentionally by the attacker. This will affect the robustness of the entire image watermarking system. In this paper recent image watermarking works are reviewed for different attacks based on image quality, size, reterived data, etc. In this paper, the different category of image watermarking attacks are analyzed based on attacker knowledge. This paper categorizes the image watermarking attacks into blind and non-blind image watermarking attacks. Then image watermarking techniques are analysed for various attacks using different quality measures. Also, this paper specifies the four different benchmark tools such as Stirmark, Optimark, Checkmark and Certimark to evaluate the image watermarking system. The image watermarking attacks are measured with the help of various performance measures. © 2010 RJPBCS.},

abstract={Telecommunication and Information technology merge together to handle medical information at remote location. During transmission, there is a possibility to attack the medical information by inserting the wrong information at sender and receiver side. Hence medical data needs protection. Using medical image watermarking technique, telemedicine provides a good healthcare system in a secured manner. This paper implements a double tier invisible medical image watermarking technique to protect patient information as well as suggestions from the remote location specialist. Proposed idea provides authentication using digital signature and avoids mismatching of patient information during diagnosis. This technique not requires key sharing between sender and receiver and easy to implement. The proposed method performance is analyzed with various quality measures like PSNR (Peak Signal to Noise Ratio), RMSE (Root Mean square Error), SSIM (Structural Similarity Index Measures), AD (Average Difference), MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and SC (Structural Content). Communication channel noises are also considered to evaluate the proposed methods against channel noise. The proposed method protects medical information in a secured manner and avoids medical information mismatching. Also, computation of quality measures proves that the proposed method provide high security in noisy channels. © 2010 RJPBCS.},

As a proof of concept, zebrafish infected with a model pathogen, Escherichia coli and a fish-specific pathogen, Aeromonas hydrophila, were subjected to treatment with PtNPs. A bacteria colony count assay revealed that the PtNPs exhibit dose-dependent inhibition of bacterial proliferation and rescued zebrafish completely from bacteria infection. The mechanism of antibacterial action includes the loss of membrane integrity and generation of reactive oxygen species. Toxicology studies reveal that the antibacterial concentration of PtNPs used in this study is non-toxic to zebrafish.

abstract={2-(2-Hydroxybenzylamino)-4-(methylthio)butanoic acid (L) together with capping molecules, produced AgNPs with unusual nanostructures that showed efficient inhibition of biofilm growth. Nanoplates of AgNPs self-assemble into micron sized flower-petal like structures in L-PSS-AgNPs whereas mesocrystals with visible voids from smaller nanoplates formed in L-SDS-AgNPs. L-PVA- and L-PVP-AgNPs showed polydispersed multi-shaped nanoparticles including nanoprisms, spheres and plates. Structure-property studies indicate that slow reduction of Ag+ ions and thiophilic interaction of L is responsible for the unusual morphology and organization of AgNPs. Importantly L-capping molecules-AgNPs exhibited strong biofilm inhibitory effect against four different bacteria, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, B. subtilis and E. coli of which, the former two are classical colonizers in burn wounds. BIC (biofilm inhibitory concentration) and MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) studies further confirmed the true anti-biofilm effect of AgNPs. Studies to unravel the mechanism of action indicated that the enhanced anti-biofilm effect could be attributed to altered membrane permeability and integrity caused by L, which in turn curtails bacterial colonization as revealed by confocal imaging. Thus a simple amino acid modified phenolic molecule exhibited an interesting assembly of AgNPs with remarkable anti-biofilm activity, which holds promise for its potential use in the fabrication of wound healing dressing materials. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.},

abstract={Background/objectives: Today, as a result of limited fuel resources and stringent emission standards, the methyl ester fuel has been focused on alternative fuels for I.C engine. Methyl ester fuels can be effectively used in low heat rejection engines (LHR), in which the surface temperature of the combustion temperature is increased by providing a thermal barrier coating. The main objective of our work is to reduce the engine exhaust emissions like HC and CO using diethyl ether in low heat rejection engine. Methods/Statistical Analysis: In this work, engine components like piston crown, cylinder head, and liner, inlet and exhaust valves of a diesel engine were coated with the ceramic material lanthanum zirconate by plasma spray technique. The effects of rapeseed methyl ester (biodiesel) produced by transesterification method and its blends with Diethyl ether (10% and 20% by volume) were studied in the low heat rejection engine. Findings: The thermal efficiency is found to be higher for diesel and biodiesel in the LHR engine. The results indicate that, B10 (10% Diethyl ether &amp; 90% Biodiesel) and B20 (20% Diethyl ether &amp; 80% Biodiesel) shows lower thermal efficiency compared with that straight biodiesel in low heat rejection engine. Applications/Improvements: Significant improvements were observed in engine exhaust emissions like CO and HC (except NOx) for all the diethyl ether blended biodiesel fuel in LHR engine. The higher oxygen content in the blended fuel reduces CO and HC emissions by 10% and 18% respectively compared to biodiesel in LHR engine.},

abstract={The present work is focussed to study the influence of titanium (Ti) and molybdenum (Mo) addition to the plain carbon steel along with copper (Cu) on wear behaviour and cutting tool performance of Fe-0.5%C-2%Cu-2%Mo-2%Ti low alloy steel combinations. Sintered preforms of low alloy steel processed through the P/M technique were subjected to hot forging at elevated temperature and the forged parts were further machined off to get wear test specimens and standard single point cutting tool. It is observed from the test results that the addition of Ti and Mo to Fe-C-Cu invariably enhances the wear resistance of the alloy steel due to the formation of possible carbides of the alloying elements. It has also been found that the tool fabricated out of P/M alloy steel has performed with better dimensional accuracy and surface finish in turning of aluminium material compared to the standard HSS tool. © 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={The objective of this review article is to study the spatio-temporal approaches for addressing the key issues such as multi-view, cluttering, jitter and occlusion in recognition of human action. Based on high-level action units, a new sparse model was developed for recognition of human action in static background. Relevant to multi-camera view, a negative space approach for identifying actions taken from different viewing angles was proposed. An approach was based on space-time quantities was proposed to acquire the changes of the action instead of camera motion. This space-time based approach has handled both cluttering and camera jitter. In static background, a sparse model presented for recognition of human action acquires the fact that actions from the same class share same units. The presented method was assessed on numerous public data sets. This method has achieved a recognition rate of 95.49% in KTH dataset and 89% in UCF datasets. Based on negative space, a region based method was offered. This approach has managed the issue of long shadows in human action recognition. The approach was assessed by most common datasets and has attained higher precision than contemporary techniques. An approach based on space-time quantities was proposed to manage cluttering. This approach achieves a recognition rate of 93.18% in KTH dataset and 81.5% in UCF dataset. To handle occlusion, a model was presented with spatial and temporal consistency. The algorithm was appraised on an outdoor dataset with background clutter and a standard indoor dataset (HumanEva-I). Results were matched with advanced pose estimation algorithms.},

abstract={Oxidative stress plays a significant role not only in cardiovascular disease but also in non-communicable diseases, where it plays a significant role the mortality rate. Hydrogen sulfide, the biological gaseous signaling molecule that preserves mitochondria in its mode of action, is an effective cardioprotective drug. However, cardiac mitochondria comprise of two distinct populations, namely interfibrillar and subsarcolemmal mitochondria, which respond distinctly in cardiovascular disease. This study was designed to determine the direct impact of cobalt chloride-induced oxidative stress in isolated mitochondrial subpopulations with an intention to examine the efficacy of hydrogen sulfide in preserving interfibrillar and subsarcolemmal mitochondria functional activities when they were incubated as pretreated, co-treated and post-treated agent. Mitochondrial subpopulations were isolated from the heart of male Wistar rats and subjected to cobalt chloride treatment (500 μM) for 20 min, followed by incubation with 10 μM sodium hydrosulfide in three different ways (Pre, Co, and Post-cobalt chloride treatment). Mitochondrial oxidative stress was measured by the concentration of thiobarbituric acid reactive species, reduced glutathione and the activities of enzymes like superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase. Mitochondrial membrane potential, swelling behavior and enzyme activities were measured to assess its function. The increased level of lipid peroxidation and the decreased level of reduced glutathione in cobalt chloride-induced group confirm the induction of oxidative stress and were more predominant in the subsarcolemmal mitochondria. Hydrogen sulfide treatment to interfibrillar and subsarcolemmal mitochondria preserved their functional activities, but the effect was prominent only with co-treated group. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that subsarcolemmal mitochondria are more prone to oxidative stress and the co-treatment of the mitochondria with hydrogen sulfide preserved the enzyme activity in the in vitro conditions. © 2016 Indian Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.},

abstract={Invasive fungal infections caused by opportunistic fungal pathogens have been emerging as a global problem of great concern as they are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Despite this, there are very limited drugs of choice to treat fungal infections. The continuous usage of these drugs is associated with resistance development and thus this is another area of concern. Fungal enzymes represent one of the most important and potential targets for drug development, as they are essential for their growth and establishment in the host. In this review, we have discussed the well established and currently available enzyme inhibitors as therapeutic choices to treat fungal infections as well as those enzyme inhibitors that have been identified as suitable drug candidates to manage fungal infections. Thus, the study of fungal biosynthetic enzymes and their inhibitors could potentially show a promising way of drug development for emerging and re-emerging fungal infections of humans. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={Wireless sensor networks (WSN) are recent area of research due to advancement in sensor technology, battery operated devices and low power systems. Major challenges in WSN are power consumption, security threads, coverage and lossless transmission. Remote reconfiguration is a process of updating new code, or image into the sensor node over-the-air without disturbing its physical location. Depending upon the application requirement, remote reconfiguration techniques are used to reprogram the sensor node in the same location. In this work, secure network reconfiguration protocol (SNRP) is proposed to reconfigure network address and network program using ARM7 LPC2129 and xbee series 2 transceiver. Network reconfiguration is performed by changing the personal area network address (PAN) from time to time and remote modification of the nodes functionality. Security is ensured in this proposed work by using a public key encryption. The timing analysis, power analysis is performed to estimate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

abstract={To tolerate the crash faults among many different data structures which requires replication of every data structure, resulting in some number of additional or extra backups. It is to present a solution, referred to as fusion that uses both erasure codes and selective replication to tolerate f crash faults based on f additional fused backups. To improve efficiency, other techniques for fusion with a focus on erasure codes such as Luby transform codes (LT codes) can be applied (Balasubramanian and Garg, 2013). On implementing the LT codes, the advantages include faster recovery from fault than normal erasure codes and also improve scalability. The applications on networks without feedback channel can achieve reliability with the help of LT codes. Since LT codes are more suitable for distributed backup systems it is made use of in distributed systems for automated fault tolerance (Balasubramanian and Garg, 2013, 2010).

For selection operation, it uses a new PRNG method called MCSPRNG (Modified-Cryptographically Secure Pseudo Random Number Generator). This MCSPRNG method increases the complexity for the attacker. Based on the random number only, the successive operation such as crossover and mutation is performed on the plain text. So, it will be very difficult for the attacker to generate the random number.

abstract={Calicut–Nilambur–Gudalur Ghat sections is one of the most important inter-state networks connection Tamil Nadu (Gudalur) and Kerala (Calicut) borders along the Western Ghats, It is located on Gudalur Taluk, Gudalur district. Calicut is one of the most popular tourist destinations. These Ghat section road slopes are very steep and rocks are fissile in nature. This can generate the problem of major and small landslides in this area. So, it is necessary to evaluate the present structure of hill slopes by carrying out a systematic study. The present paper emphasis a methodology to Landslide Hazard Zonation map using hydrological parameters. The thematic maps such as drainage map, buffer, drainage density, drainage intensity, run-off, rainfall intensity and slope of the study area were prepared on 1:25, 000 scales. Relief has been traced from toposheet. Slope and aspect maps were prepared from the contour map. Drainage density drainage buffer and drainage intensity map has been derived from drainage. Thematic maps were digitalized with the help of ARC MAP software. Multicriteria analysis was done using all thematic layers by assigning proper weightages and scores for individual features based on their contribution to landslides. Based on the output, the study area was ranked into 5 different categories of hazard zones such as very low, low, moderate, high and very high. The hazard zonation map shows that 0. 50% in very low, 13. 30% low, 55. 80% in moderate, 29. 44% in high and 0. 96% very high hazard zone. The landslide hazard zonation map is validated with landslide points which were collected from the field using high performance GPS. According to landslide inventory details 1. 64% is located in very high, 29. 50% in high, 62. 30% in moderate, 4. 92% in low and 1. 64% in very low hazard zones.

Group V Animals treated with standard drug Silymarin (20mg/Kg body weight orally) for 14 days. After completed the experiment, the liver markers, lipid profile and antioxidants were analysed. Phytochemical screening of aqueous extract of Cleome viscosa seeds indicates the presence of flavonoids, tannins, glycosides, phenol, steroids, alkaloids, quinone, saponin and coumarin. Supplementation of Asteracantha longifolia significantly restored the liver markers, lipid profile and antioxidant markers on in CCl4 induced Wistar albino rats. The results of our study showed that Cleome viscosa seeds possess significant hepatoprotective and antioxidant activity, probably due to its phytochemicals.},

abstract={Rapid growth of web and its applications has created a colossal importance for recommender systems. Being applied in various domains, recommender systems were designed to generate suggestions such as items or services based on user interests. Basically, recommender systems experience many issues which reflects dwindled effectiveness. Integrating powerful data management techniques to recommender systems can address such issues and the recommendations quality can be increased significantly. Recent research on recommender systems reveals an idea of utilizing social network data to enhance traditional recommender system with better prediction and improved accuracy. This paper expresses views on social network data based recommender systems by considering usage of various recommendation algorithms, functionalities of systems, different types of interfaces, filtering techniques, and artificial intelligence techniques. After examining the depths of objectives, methodologies, and data sources of the existing models, the paper helps anyone interested in the development of travel recommendation systems and facilitates future research direction. We have also proposed a location recommendation system based on social pertinent trust walker (SPTW) and compared the results with the existing baseline random walk models. Later, we have enhanced the SPTW model for group of users recommendations. The results obtained from the experiments have been presented. © 2016 Logesh Ravi and Subramaniyaswamy Vairavasundaram.},

abstract={Various biological jobs are executed in cloud environment to utilize the resources and improve the performance of the computation. Free from unnecessary yoke related to supervising those biological computing resources and get rid of the expenditure of maintaining the resources. Reliability is a complex issue in a cloud environment, a key to improve it by using Fault Tolerance Approach (FTM). Proactive and Reactive Fault Tolerance strategies are there to provide services continuously in spite of failures or faults occur to offer highly reliable cloud service. The paper proposes a framework which integrates Fault tolerance and Anti-fragility to survey on both fault prediction and recovery method. This framework has three stages (i) Fault Detection Watcher (FDW) (ii) Fault Overseer (FO) (iii) Fault Resilience. FDW is used to identify faults either known or unknown. Fault overseer is used as a monitoring mechanism for proactive policy predict and recover known faults and Fault Resilience is for fault tolerance as reactive policy detect and recover unknown faults. Network and application faults are concerned with fault overseer; Fault induction and event log are the phases. Database and VM failures look after by Fault resilience stage. Fragments and replication are core objective of this phase. Proposed approach validates using reliability metrics in cloudsim simulator. The experiment result revealed the probability of proposed approach under the conditions of availability, reliability and performance. This paper shows a novel framework in an integrated manner, of proactive and reactive policies in terms of fault overseer and anti-fragility mechanism to execute biological job.},

abstract={Data mining is defined as the process of extracting immeasurable attractive patterns from large quantity of data. The data store may contain some sensitive information related to individuals. These information needs to be preserved during data sharing and data mining. The idea of privacy-preserving data mining is to transform the original data in such a way that it doesn't reveal the confidential information to the users running the algorithm and at the same time it needs to generate the output as if the algorithm has used the original data. In this paper we put forward a substitution based process for accomplishing privacy in data mining which diverge from the traditional data perturbation methods which are used comprehensively for this purpose. The uniqueness of this approach is that it generates the sanitized data without utilizing a noise addition scheme. Bit wise substitution is used to generate the modified data from the original one. From our experiments it is established that this approach assures privacy and also enhances data utility.},

abstract={Water is a basic necessity of all living beings for their survival on Earth. Hence, it has to be ensured to be distributed effectively. A water distribution system is a mesh of pipelines that distribute water to consumers. They are designed to satisfy adequately the water requirements for a combination of domestic, industrial and commercial purposes. A network designed with extreme care regarding pressure, losses, supply, quality of pipes and workmanship usually satisfies adequate water pressure at the consumer's taps for a specific rate of flow in an economical manner. But, due to the unexpected vertical growth and horizontal expansion, the designed network may not supply the assessed demand. This ultimately affects the supply level of low pressure zones, as well as remote places that are far away from the source. Hence, it is necessary to consider resiliency of the network at the design level of the water distribution system which can represent the capability of the network to meet additional demands or withstand demand fluctuations that may occur during peak hours. The basic principle used to improve the resilience is to increase the diameter of the pipe to the pipeline to achieve maximum flow velocity. Increasing the diameters of the various pipes of an optimally designed network or an existing network considerably increases the efficiency of the system due to the increase in its resilience index. Parallel piping system is another option adopted to enhance resilience, in which a stretch experiencing maximum velocity is chosen. An additional pipe is installed parallel to the existing pipe in that stretch, thereby increasing the flow of water from the source and decreasing the velocity in that stretch. This ultimately increases the resilience index of the system, thereby meeting the additional demand incurred on that system. This is illustrated using two benchmark networks available in literature. The results of the study indicate that the parallel pipe approach is found to be better than increasing the pipe size approach both in terms of resilience enhancement as well as economy. © 2016 JUST.

abstract={Every project confronts risk both in financial and technical dimensions. This induces a greater response on the performance of the project. A successful construction project depends on how the project participants compute the actual project performance. A commendable assessment of project performance practice determines the project productivity both quantitatively and qualitatively. Methods of project performance measurement vary among industries. As a contribution to the above, this study equips the project manager with a proficient mode of project performance measurement and the essential promising decisions that head to profit maximization. This intricate study thus facilitates the project manager to compute the project performance on the basis of the effects of Earned Value Management (EVM) indices which are broadly classified as: variance indices, performance indices and miscellaneous or forecast indices. Adopting the Analytical Network Process (ANP) structure model in Super Decision software is a reliable decision making tool. This study indicates that the cost variance (CV) index is prominent among the EVM indices that highly affect the project characteristics, the measurement of which facilitates the required control measures on respective project activities. It also indicates that cost is the major project characteristic, the variation of which immensely affects the project performance. It procures an objective reference for engineering projects by following the selection process of best EVM indices that holds an accurate measure of project performance. © 2016 JUST.

abstract={Clinical conditions of the esophagus are conventionally treated by autologous grafts and are generally associated with complications such as leakage, infection and stenosis necessitating an alternative synthetic graft with superior outcomes. Therefore, in the present study, we have fabricated polymeric random and aligned nanofibers of PHBV, PHBV-gelatin, PCL and PCL-gelatin using electrospinning. The cell-matrix interaction, an essential parameter to obtain proper tissue regeneration, has been investigated using non-keratinized, stratified, squamous epithelial cells. Immunostaining of the filamentous actin morphology of epithelial cells on the nanofibers revealed the elongated and spread morphology demonstrating that the nanofibers provide proper contact guidance and right milieu for the cell growth and proliferation. The aligned nanofibrous scaffolds exhibited oriented cell growth along the fiber axis, which was not observed in the random nanofibers. PCL-gelatin nanofibers exhibited maximum cell proliferation when compared to other types of scaffolds investigated. There was no significant difference observed in the gene expression and cell proliferation between the random and aligned nanofibers (p > 0.05). However, gelatin incorporated PCL scaffold showed significantly higher cell proliferation and function gene expression levels than the PCL nanofibers (p < 0.05). Thus the study concludes that the nanofibrous scaffolds may have potential for the regeneration of mucosal layer of the esophagus tissue. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

Assays were carried out to determine the formation of fructosamine, inhibition of fluorescent AGEs, protein bound carbonyl content, lysine modification and effect on glycation induced fibrillation based on thioflavin T (ThT) binding and confocal imaging. The protective effect of EAA on albumin conformation was determined based on the circular dichroism analysis. EAA exhibited differential effects on the non-enzymatic glycation induced structural modification of albumin. In addition to this, EEA also showed potent inhibitory activity towards in vitro goat lens protein. Tryptophan, phenylalanine and lysine showed the highest and valine showed the lowest antiglycation activity. The molecular interaction pattern of EAA as determined by computational methods revealed their affinity, binding site and the residues involved in binding. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.},

abstract={End user satisfaction in enterprise resource planning (ERP) among the employees in India has been analysed using EUCS instrument. This study is unique in including 'expectations' and 'dependable' to measure satisfaction in a modified EUCS scale. EUCS had been used only in a few of the studies in ERP and the existing literature on user satisfaction also had emphasised the need for retesting of the instrument in many countries and cultures. ERP market in India is expected to grow at a CAGR of 22.2% over the period 2011-2015 (TechNavio) and India is a key player in the IT market. Its IT end users are culturally different from other countries. Hence, there is need for this study and for re-testing the EUCS instrument among the end users of ERP in India. The study also attempted to find the differences in satisfaction among the employees having different work experiences and demographic characteristics. © Copyright 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={Zinc oxide (ZnO) thin films were deposited on glass substrates using chemical spray pyrolysis technique at different substrate temperatures such as 523, 623 and 723 K. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns confirmed the formation of polycrystalline films with hexagonal wurtzite crystal structure and revealed the change in preferential orientation of the crystal planes. Scanning electron micrographs showed the formation of uniformly distributed spherical shaped grains at low deposition temperature and pebbles like structure at the higher temperature. Transmittance of 85% was observed for the film deposited at 723 K. The band gap of the films was found to be increased from 3.15 to 3.23 eV with a rise in deposition temperature. The electrical conductivity of the films was found to be improved with an increase in substrate temperature. Surface of ZnO thin films deposited at 523 K, 623 K and 723 K were found to be hydrophobic with the contact angles of 92°, 105° and 128° respectively. The room temperature gas sensing characteristics of all the films were studied and found that the film deposited at 623 K showed a better response towards ammonia vapour.

abstract={Wireless sensor network consists of numerous sensors that are embedded with microprocessors and radio transceivers. These sensor nodes are deployed in a distributed fashion to sense the environmental conditions and this data is sent to a fixed Base Station (BS) of WSN. LEACH (Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy) protocol uses distributed algorithm to form the sensor clusters. The selection of Cluster Heads (CH) is random and these CHs send the aggregated data directly to the BS. When the network diameter increases beyond a certain level, the distance between the CHs and the BS also increases. This is the drawback of single-hop communication as it reduces the network life time and energy efficiency of sensor nodes. The paper proposes Radio signal Multi-hop protocol which elects the CH based on the residual energy of sensor nodes. A CH also acts as a Prime Cluster Head (PCH) when it is nearer to the BS and this distance is determined by the radio signal. In a multi-hop network, each PCH receives the aggregated data from its closest CHs which in turn sends this to the BS. The proposed protocol results in improved lifetime and energy efficiency of sensor nodes. © 2006-2016 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN). All rights reserved.},

abstract={Copper aluminium oxide thin films were synthesised using the spray pyrolysis technique for different solvent volumes with a constant Cu/Al molar ratio. The preferential orientation is found along (100) and (102) planes, and the crystallite sizes are in the range from 21·6 to 28·4 nm. The structural studies reveal that the grown films were polycrystalline in nature. Hall effect results confirm that the grown films are p type. When the solvent volume is increased from 10 to 40 mL, the resistivity of the films decreases from 1·12×10-6 to 6×2×10-8 Ω cm. The band gap of the films increases with increasing the solvent volume. The obtained results show that the grown films can be used as the active layer in a solar cell. © 2016 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining.},

abstract={Epigenetic regulation of neuronal signalling through histone acetylation dictates transcription programs that govern neuronal memory, plasticity and learning paradigms. Histone Acetyl Transferases (HATs) and Histone Deacetylases (HDACs) are antagonistic enzymes that regulate gene expression through acetylation and deacetylation of histone proteins around which DNA is wrapped inside a eukaryotic cell nucleus. The epigenetic control of HDACs and the cellular imbalance between HATs and HDACs dictate disease states and have been implicated in muscular dystrophy, loss of memory, neurodegeneration and autistic disorders. Altering gene expression profiles through inhibition of HDACs is now emerging as a powerful technique in therapy. This review presents evolving applications of HDAC inhibitors as potential drugs in neurological research and therapy. Mechanisms that govern their expression profiles in neuronal signalling, plasticity and learning will be covered. Promising and exciting possibilities of HDAC inhibitors in memory formation, fear conditioning, ischemic stroke and neural regeneration have been detailed. © 2016 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal generated by the brain’s spontaneous recording of electrical activity is often utilized in diagnosis for brain disorders and also employed in rehabilitation devices compared to other biosignals. This work proposes an EEG-based wireless mobile robot control using brain-computer interface (BCI) for people with motor disabilities can interact with robotic systems. An experimental model of mobile robot is explored and it can be controlled by human eye blink strength and attention level. A closed neuro-feedback loop is used to control different mental fatigue. Here, the EEG signals are acquired from neurosky mindwave sensor (single channel prototype) and features of these signals are extracted by adopting discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to enhance signal resolution. Preprocessed signals are impart to robot module, different movements are detected such as right, left, forward, backward, stop positioned on eye blink strength. The proposed adaptive human- machine interface system provides better accuracy and navigates the mobile robot based on user command, so it can be adaptable for disabled people. © Springer India 2016.},

abstract={Secure transmission of images have become an important in case of its application and research. This study proposes a discrete wavelet-based resolution synthesis using interpolation in discrete wavelet transform (DWT) with a novel encryption method. Highly resoluted image has its importance in various applications like radar, electron microscopy, digital X-ray mammography, optical coherence tomography, astronomy, etc. High-resolution image is recovered from a low-resolution image where the image is transformed using Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau 9/7 wavelet to obtain significant effectiveness in image resolution. By using the DWT, low-quality image is divided into various subbands of different frequency levels. These low-resoluted images are then interpolated using Cohen-Daubechies wavelet 9/7 coefficients and this interpolation provides nonlinearity over the image in order to preserve the visual smoothness edges. Preserved subband images are projected using fanbeam projection. These preserved various level images are used for reconstruction. High-resoluted image is then obtained using inverse discrete wavelet transform. These images are encrypted using the Pascal series. A significant improvement is obtained over other 2-D wavelet decomposition techniques such as bilinear, bicubic, nearest neighbor, and box wavelets. This study also implements this technique with the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) images for the betterment of perfor- mance metrics like peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index (SSIM). These results are produced using MATLAB simulation software. © Springer India 2016.},

Initially the financial performance of Sun Pharma is analysed in terms of Net Sales, Net Profit, Assets and EPS. In addition, the financial performance of the company is compared with Indian pharma industry average. The industry average is established by considering the weighted average performance of five pharma companies, which are listed in BSE and ranked according to market capitalization. For this purpose financial ratios of the category viz., Liquidity, Asset Management, Debt Management, Profitability and Market are applied. It is observed from the study that the financial ratios, based on the stand alone key information, may give lackluster impression about the company's current financial performance but their strategic decisions, of global exposure through the mergers and acquisition route, are expected to change its present scenario in the near future.},

To achieve autonomy, a visual control system was employed which uses visual images as medium to perform computer based closed loop control. The mobile robot was localized using single optical landmark flitted over the ceiling of the arena which claims to be simple and more reliable. The computer commands the robot using a visual patterns generated and displayed on computer monitor. A novel image interface module hardware was designed which will translate this visual pattern into a motor command for the robot wheels. A graphical user interface was also deigned to monitor the performance and for manual control of the robot. Finally, the performance of the robot was evaluated by subjecting it to a square trajectory and the results and further usage of the robot platform were discussed. © 2016 by IJIR (CESER PUBLICATIONS).},

The estimated rotor flux signals are used as the input signal for the adaptive observer to estimate the speed. In ANN-based method, adaptive model is constructed with a feedforward neural network to estimate the rotor speed. Feedforward ANN algorithm is used to train the network. The training algorithm decides the learning speed, stability, and dynamic performance of the system. Both methods have good speed tracking capability.

abstract={Radio Frequency Identification [RFID] system is evolving as a major technology in Automation System in Malls/Buildings/Industries or in the medical field in order to increase efficiency and security. Typically RFID comprises of two parts. First is the RFID reader/Interrogator and the second is the RFID transponder. Transponder may be smart cards or tags or key chains or any other electronic devices. RFID technology is the advanced method of barcode method. RFID system uses electromagnetic fields (radio waves) in order to transfer data for performing automatic detection and tracking of different tags or different objects from some distance. RFID system is an Automatic Identification and Data Capture (AIDC) technology used to identify, capture, track and store the data present in the tag. The main objective is to provide a system with security. In this paper we have proposed contactless smart cards in order to limit the unauthorized vehicles to enter into the parking area. Each card has unique information stored in it and if it comes nearer to the reader then RFID reader scans the information present in the card and sends this information to the database (stores the data present in the tag) and displays the relevant information on LCD. If the reader has details about that tag in the database then gate is opened automatically for authorized vehicle to enter into the parking lot, If not gate will be closed and alerts through a buzzer for unauthorized vehicle.},

abstract={The quality of speech signal needs to be enhanced for applications like teleconferencing, hearing aids, speech recognition etc. Basically, speech-enhancement techniques are responsible for the removal of additive noise, to recover the noise free speech signal. This paper deals with an effective method, stochastic resonance (SR), in which the weak speech signal can be improved by increasing its signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) through addition of white Gaussian noise. Noise, though considered obnoxious in signal processing, can also be used constructively. Pertinence of stochastic resonance in signal processing is aimed at examining the detection of a weak speech signal buried in strong noise. Realizing the effect of stochastic resonance depends on the effective nonlinear system which is mathematically optimized through fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm and the system parameters were adjusted adaptively to examine the stochastic resonance (SR) effect on output signal-to-noise ratio and peak of the output signal spectrum. © Springer India 2016.},

abstract={Nowadays, the need for of data-integrity and privacy is higher than ever. From small bank transactions to large-scale classified military information, these factors have been prerequisites. This classified information can be faked deliberately by the sender with the help of a pseudo secret in order to increase the level of security. Cryptography makes this information unreadable and steganography hides the same. This paper brings together the paths of steganography and Rijndael encryption, which is commonly known as the AES. The secret image or text-file is encrypted using AES algorithm and is then camouflaged into the pseudo- secret image using a modified proposed Knight's Tour-inspired chess-based algorithm that enhances data diffusion. Then the pseudo-secret image/text is once again encrypted using the AES algorithm and is masked into the cover image/text using a checkerboard-based location map. Thus lossless, highly secure, nested-layer steganography is achieved with high complexity and high PSNR for various extension types of images as illustrated in the paper. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

abstract={The development of alternate material to replace cement by new eco friendly materials such as fly ash, rice husk ash, silica fume slag etc., by method of alkali activation under thermal curing process forms a new binder called geopolymer. These materials not only increases the strength but considerably decreases the emission of carbon dioxide gas to the atmosphere and also these mineral admixtures also can be used as a replacement material for cement to meet the future demand. In this study an attempt has been made to produce ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) based geopolymer concrete and to find out its compressive strength characteristics by considering the parameters such as ratio of alkaline liquid (AL) to (GGBFS), ratio of silicate to hydroxide (SiO3/OH) and the age of geopolymer concrete with different temperatures of thermal curing has been adopted. Detailed experimental investigations were carried out to assess the effect of the above mentioned parameters on compressive strength. From the results it was understood that with AL/GGBFS = 0.30, SiO3/OH= 1.5, for thermal curing temperature of 100°C, for curing period of 56 days yielded better compressive strength when compared to conventional concrete under normal curing. Hence use of GGBFS based geopolymer concrete is recommended for construction.},

abstract={This work focuses on the improvement of the wild strain for the hyper production of laccase through random mutagenesis. Maximum laccase production (46956 U/L) was observed in mutant T. hirsuta, when rice bran (5 g) at 75 % moisture (w/v) was used with 1 mL inoculum at pH 6 and 25 °C in the presence of 1 % (w/v) glucose as a carbon source, 0.1 % (w/v) sodium nitrate as a nitrogen source, 2 % of (v/v) glycerol as an inducer in submerged fermentation under static conditions. Laccase purification was performed by precipitating the enzyme with 90 % ammonium sulphate followed by ion exchange chromatography. The puried laccase had an apparent molecular mass of 49.9 kDa with monomeric structure estimated by SDS-PAGE. The three azo dyes could be efficiently decolourized by the purified laccase in the presence of a HBT as redox mediators after 3 h of incubation at pH 5. Laccase mediated degradation of poneaceau was monitored by UV-visible, IR-spectroscopy, HPLC and GCMS. Furthermore, the decolourization products of poneaceau were found to be aromatic amines and less phytotoxic nature than the untreated dye.},

If this analysis is accurate the futuristic region where robot and obstacle collision is likely to occur can be estimated. This enables the mobile robot to take corrective action prior to collision. In this approach, the motion pattern of the obstacle is analysed by taking into account the past co-ordinates traversed by the obstacle. Then the futuristic region where the obstacle is likely to occupy is predicted. This region is termed as region of certainty. Simulation results shows that the approach gives more reliable prediction as many number of sample points representing the past positions travelled by the obstacles are taken into consideration. The algorithm yielded better performance under higher obstacle velocity conditions and the results were compared with distance time transform method. © School of Engineering, Taylor’s University.},

The mineral admixture namely metakaolin (MK) was added 15% as replacement of cement for developing self compacting concrete (SCC) specimens. The experimental programme was developed with the two composite specimens namely, one composite short column specimen with conventional vibrated reinforced cement concrete (CVC) and the another composite short column specimen with reinforced self compacting concrete (SCC) with M60 grade as per ACI code. The significance of the investigation was to examine maximum compressive load of composite short column under static loading conditions by varying the high strength concrete type. The comparison of structural behaviour of CVC and SCC composite short columns was obtained. Finally the load displacement curve and stress strain curve was plotted to study and compare the behaviour of both types of short composite columns.},

abstract={Traditionally design of concrete will be a function of strength and not as a function of durability. To meet the requirements of durability in addition to strength, high performance concrete was developed. In this paper a detailed experimental investigation was carried out to evaluate the mechanical and durability characteristics of high performance fiber reinforced concrete to understand the effect of fibers. Experiments were conducted for three different water-binder ratios of 0.225, 0.25 and 0.275. Similarly three different volumes of fiber namely 1, 1.5 and 2% of volume of concrete were used. The characteristic compressive strength of concrete was taken as 70 MPa. Properties such as compressive strength, load deflection characteristics and porosity were studied. It was inferred from the results that high performance concrete with 1.5% volume of fiber with water-binder ratio of 0.25 performed well. Load carrying capacity of high performance fiber reinforced concrete was found to be higher than the control concrete.},

abstract={Nanotechnology signifies the evolving area of research and development, concerned in delivering innovative solutions to increase the efficacy of a product. In recent times, application of nanotechnology is rising in the arena of cosmeceuticals and seems to be promising in overcoming certain drawbacks associated with the traditional products. The nanotechnology-based delivery techniques have proved to offer advantages of greater stability, higher efficacy and have also been reported to show prolonged effects. Nanoparticles are also proficient in modifying the flux, targeting the drug to the location, tailoring the size of drug and in making the stratum corneum permeable in a selective manner. The rapid evolution of nanotechnology has given rise to great aspirations; however there are certain concerns still, regarding the possible hazards of nanoparticles to the human health, which could be neglected because of their less significant toxicity. This review gives a brief overview of the various novel nano-carriers for cosmeceuticals like nanoemulsions, liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles(SLNs), dendrimers, inorganic nanoparticles, nanocrystals, etc. Safety of nanoparticles use and also the different routes of exposure to the nanoparticles have been discussed here. © 2016 The Authors.

abstract={Objective: The present study was undertaken to investigate the thrombolytic activity of Punica granatum fruit and peel extract. Methods: Phytoconstituents and free radical scavenging activity of P. granatum extract were performed. Ethanolic and aqueous extract of fruit and peel of the plant was used for in vitro clot lysis activity using streptokinase (SK) as standard. In a series of pre-weighed eppendorf tubes, equal volume of venous blood was collected and serum was removed and the tubes were weighed. The tubes containing clot were incubated with fruit, peel extract (100 ug/ml), and SK individually at 37°C for 60 minutes. After incubation, fluid obtained was removed, and tubes were again weighed to observe the difference in weight after clot disruption. The percent of clot lysis was determined. Results: Free radical scavenging activity of the extracts was increased in a dose-dependent manner. Of the extracts, ethanolic extract showed maximum activity as compared with aqueous extract, whereas the ascorbic acid exerted maximum activity as compared with the extracts. Maximum thrombolytic activity (59%) was observed with ethanolic extract of peel of the fruit. Conclusions: The present study concluded that the aqueous and ethanolic extracts of P. granatum fruit and peel possess thrombolytic activity. © 2016, Asian Journal of Pharmaceutical and Clinical Research.

abstract={Non- alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is considered as the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome. NAFLD is associated with several components of metabolic syndrome like obesity, insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia and hypertension. Further, NAFLD and metabolic syndrome are independently associated with psoriasis. The chronic systemic inflammation is thought to be the bridging link between the metabolic syndrome, NAFLD and psoriasis nexus. However, the exact pathogenic mechanism for this nexus is yet to be elucidated. Currently there are no formal guidelines for the treatment of this comorbid condition. Several drugs like methotrexate and cyclosporine, used in the treatment of psoriasis are known to induce liver damage. It is important to pay attention on the influence of psoriasis treatment on metabolic syndrome and NAFLD and vice versa. In this book chapter, scientific evidence that explains the relationship between metabolic syndrome, NAFLD and psoriasis and the treatment strategy for this comorbid condition will be discussed. © 2016 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.},

abstract={Since ages, medicine is the most consistent companion of man. While in primeval time, disease was cured through natural preparations, onset of technology has made today’s formulations synthetic or nature derived. Across the ages, the plausibility of the “savior-turned-slayer” functionality of these drugs remained constant. With the increment in documentation, it becomes evident that many of the commonly used drugs are associated with toxicities. Thus, any drug, irrespective of its origin, needs to be thoroughly assessed. Rampant use of herbal drugs has often been a threat to human health owing to the scarcity in quality assessment. What needs to be understood is that everything natural is not safe. They may pose a threat and thus need to be verified before being touted as a healer. Herein, we discuss the toxicity quotient of herbal medicine in reference to the liver - the metabolic controller of our body. Liver holds a prime position owing to its multitudinal functionality. We attempt to present a brief overview of the mechanisms of hepatotoxicity and highlight the nexus between herbal medicines and liver injury. We discuss the potential ways that can assure quality check of herbal medicines through imposition of regulatory laws, databases, and resorting to toxicogenomics. While constant endeavors need to be made in the quest for novel and more effective drugs, at the same time, assuring its safety is of paramount significance. Thus, plants, which are a huge reservoir of drug leads, necessitate the need to examine products derived from them and subsequently propose their efficacies in human health. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2016.},

abstract={A strong, well-functioning immune system is the cornerstone of good health. Immunity is the balanced state of having adequate biological defenses to fight infection, disease, or other unwanted biological invasion while having tolerance to avoid allergy and autoimmune diseases. Immune responses are the result of an effective interaction between innate (natural and non-specific) and acquired (adaptive and specific) components of the immune system. Over the last three decades, there has been remarkable interest in the immune system as a potential target of toxicity following exposure to drugs, chemicals or environmental pollutants. Immunodeficiencies occur when one or more of the components of the immune system are inactive. Many factors play a significant role in altering the immunocompetence such as age, sex, genetic variability, stress, alcohol/drug abuse, malnutrition, environmental pollution, lifestyle. Immunomodulation is a very broad term which refers to any changes in the immune response and may involve induction, expression, amplification or inhibition of any part or phase in the immune response. In clinical perspective immunomodulators can be classified into the following three categories: Immunoadjuvants, immunostimulants, and immunosuppresants. A diverse array of synthetic, natural and recombinant compounds is available with both merits and demerits. Phytochemicals are naturally occurring compound with bioactive potentials, which have potential immunostimulating activity. The present review focused on the immune-modulating activity of various phytochemicals such as alkaloids, polysaccharides, lectins, glycosides, phenolic compounds, flavonoids, anthocyanins, tannins, saponins, terpenoids, sterols and also explains the role of antioxidants as immune-modulators.},

abstract={This work proposes the design of shunt hybrid filter using instantaneous power theory to improve the power quality and simulation has been carried out for 3 phase distribution system feeding different types of non linear loads. The proposed filter consists of parallel combination of 5th and 7th tuned selective harmonic elimination passive filters, which is connected in series with a small rating IGBTs based voltage source inverter. In this work, principle of compensation and filtering behavior of the system has been discussed in detail. Instantaneous real and reactive power theory based controller has been designed to estimate the reference current from the distorted current. In order to reduce the harmonics, generated reference currents are tracked by voltage source inverter using hysteresis band current controller. The performance of the hybrid scheme is evaluated for various nonlinear loads using Matlab/ Simulink tool. The detailed analysis has been carried out on harmonics reduction and DC bus voltage regulation and the simulation result ensures the feasibility of suggested control strategy. The proposed topology improves the filtering performance of the passive filter in hybrid scheme. Copyright © 2016 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This paper explores the possibility of using externally bonded Hybrid Fiber Reinforced Polymer (HyFRP) with the combinations glass (GFRP) and carbon (CFRP) based laminate to strengthen the Reinforced Concrete (RC) beams against flexure. For this purpose a total of five beams were cast and tested. The beams were with a cross section of 150 mm × 250 mm and 3000 mm long. Four point loading was applied to test the flexural strength of beams over a simply supported span of 2800 mm. Out of five beams, one beams served as reference specimen and the other four beams were made with hybrid FRP laminates on their soffit. Spacing of stirrups, thickness of HYFRP laminate and composite ratio was taken as varying parameters. Sufficient data was obtained on the strength, deformation and failure characteristics of Hybrid Fibre Reinforced Polymer laminated (HyFRP) as well as reference beams. The Hybrid Fibre Reinforced Polymer (HyFRP) strengthened reinforced concrete beams exhibit increased strength and composite action until failure. © IAEME Publication.},

abstract={Rapid mixing in microchannels plays a significant role in chemical, biological and medical analysis fields. Microchannels are widely used for chemical and biochemical reactions because of their high surface to volume ratio. However, the rate of mixing of two or more chemical reagents is less as the flow through the micro-channel is highly laminar. Thus, two reactive fluids are predominantly parallel when they flow along the length of the channel. Generally, obstacles or surface modifications are made in the flow path which induces chaotic advection in the fluids. Considerable amount of research has been done in the past in developing different types of surface modifications to enhance the chaotic mixing. But, the intricate nature of fluid flow phenomenon makes it difficult to design the surface modification suitable to achieve the maximum rapid mixing. The present work aims at designing micromixers with the objective of obtaining rapid mixing with reduced pressure drop. A topology optimization algorithm is illustrated in the present manuscript for the design of optimal micromixer configuration. Finite element based optimization for surface modification of micromixer is developed using porosity of the channel as the control variable. In the present work, the optimisation solver works over two objectives. One is to increase the mixing in the channel and the second is to reduce the pressure drop. Numerical experiments are done to test the algorithm to obtain the optimal surface modification to achieve maximum rapid mixing between the two fluids. The results show that rapid mixing is achieved with the modified topology obtained using the code. Copyright © 2016 by ASME.},

abstract={The aim of the study is to investigate the loss of mechanical properties such as compressive and splitting tensile strength of fiber-reinforced concrete (FRC) when exposed to impact load. Two different steel fibers i.e. hooked end and crimped end having the length of 50 mm and an aspect ratio of 50 were used as reinforcing materials in 0.5%, 1.0% and 1.5% volumes with a water-binder ratio of 0.42. The American concrete institute (ACI) committee 544 drop weight test was performed on 28 days cured cylinders, in order to determine the impact failure energy. In order to identify the loss of compressive and splitting tensile strength due to the effect of impact, another set of samples were prepared from the same concrete mixtures and exposed to impact loads of 25%, 40%, and 55% of their impact failure energy. Based on the results obtained from the experimental work, multivariate linear regression (MLR) models were developed using SPSS software to predict the percentage loss of compressive and splitting tensile strength due to the effect of impact load and the validity of the proposed model were verified with the test data of an earlier research. The results showed that the loss of compressive and splitting tensile strength in FRC significantly decreased compared with concrete without fiber, when exposed to impact loads. The results of the proposed model provided good agreement with the experimental results. © 2016, Procema SA. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Purpose - The paper aims to develop a mathematical model for delamination and surface roughness during end milling by using response surface methodology (RSM) and to determine how the input parameters (cutting speed, depth of cut, helix angle and feed rate) influence the output response (delamination and surface roughness) in machining of hybrid glass fibre reinforced plastic (GFRP; Abaca and Glass) composite using solid carbide end mill cutter. Design/methodology/approach - Four-factor, three-level Taguchi orthogonal array design in RSM is used to carry out the experimental investigation. The "Design Expert 8.0" is used to analyse the data collected graphically. Analysis of variance is carried out to validate the model and for determining the most significant parameter. Findings - The feed rate is the cutting parameter which has greater influence on delamination (88.39 per cent), and cutting speed is the cutting parameter which has greater influence on surface roughness (53.42 per cent) for hybrid GFRP composite materials. Both surface roughness and delamination increase as feed rate increases, which means that the composite damage is larger for higher feed rates. Originality/value - Effect of milling of hybrid GFRP composite on delamination and surface roughness with various helix angles of solid carbide end mill has not been analysed yet using RSM. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Wireless sensor network (WSN) comprises a large number of sensor nodes (SN) in which each node can sense, process, store and transmit/receive the data from the external environment. Computation rate, communication range, power is most important constraints of the SN. A SN in the bounded region forward the data among the nodes, and then finally it reaches the base station [sink node (SiN)]. Number of nodes tries to communicate with a SiN at the same time; leads to consume more power also increase the network traffic results in data loss and reduce the node lifetime. In this paper, mobile relay node (MRN) is developed using LPC2148 processor and introduced into WSN. It moves throughout the network for collecting data. An optimal algorithm is developed and to optimise the data communication, re-routing the traffic and reduce power consumption of each SN. In this work, power consumption, processing time and memory analysis of MRN is discussed. Copyright © 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={G. lucidum total triterpenes were assessed for its apoptosis-inducing and anti-tumour activities. The ability of the total triterpenes to induce apoptosis was evaluated in Dalton's lymphoma ascites (DLA) and Ehrlich's ascites carcinoma (EAC) cell lines. Total triterpenes were found to be highly cytotoxic to DLA and EAC cell lines with IC50 values 5 ± 0.32 and 7.9 ± 0.2 μg/ml respectively. Total triterpenes induced apoptosis in both cell lines which is evident from the DNA fragmentation assay. Anti-tumour activity was accessed using DLA induced solid and EAC induced ascites tumour models in Swiss albino mice. Administration of 10, 50 and 100 mg/kg b. wt. total triterpenes showed 11.86, 27.27 and 40.57% increase in life span of animals in ascites tumour model. Treatment with 10, 50 and 100 mg/kg b. wt. total triterpenes exhibited 76.86, 85.01 and 91.03% inhibition in tumour volume and 67.96, 72.38 and 77.90% inhibition in tumour weight respectively in the solid tumour model. The study reveals the significant dose-dependent anti-tumour activity of total triterpenes in both models. Total triterpenes were more active against the solid tumour than the ascites tumour. The anti-oxidant potential and ability to induce cell-specific apoptosis could be contributing to its anti-tumour activities. © 2016 by the C.M.B. Association. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Phase change materials (PCMs) with their phenomenal phase changing behavior hold a key for many developments in renewable energy and engineering systems for sustainable future. PCM which can store and release heat energy over a temperature range has become an eminent candidate for many engineering applications that includes thermal, civil, electronics and textile. In modern days, Nano-PCMs have gained much attention of the engineers in utilizing them for thermal energy storage systems, for cooling microelectronic systems, for space heating or cooling in modern buildings and also in smart textiles for human comfort. Contribution of Nano-PCM based energy systems in energy savings and reduction of global gas emission is of interest now. This review provides an outlook of various types of PCM, choices of nanomaterial for incorporation and applications of nanomaterial incorporated PCMs. The most common types of PCM used are water, paraffin, hydrated salts and bio based PCM. Despite their high latent heat storage advantage, their low thermal property calls for the incorporation of nanomaterials. Nanomaterials with their high surface to volume ratio tune the thermal properties of the base PCM. Nanomaterials used for incorporation in PCM include Al, Cu, SiO2, TiO2, Carbon nanotubes (CNT), Carbon nanofibers (CNF), Al2O3, NaOH KOH etc. © 2016 Eastern Macedonia and Thrace Institute of Technology.

abstract={Condition based monitoring and assessment of insulating oil has become a vital constituent for ascertaining the reliability of oil-filled transformers. Partial Discharge (PD) measurement is one of the proven techniques to analyze the variations in discharge activity in insulating oil degradation under normal and abnormal operating conditions. PD activity is connected with the physical characteristics of oil and other external influencing factors like applied voltage, temperature, etc. Since PD pulse signature patterns are complex non-markovian process, capturing the time dependent variation of discharges during degradation of oil is important in understanding the dynamics of degradation. PD data is measured under the influence of both accelerated electrical stress conditions. Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is applied to characterize the stochastic behavior of the PD pulse transition in the insulation system. Continuous Density Hidden Markov Model (CDHMM) has been implemented to analyze the changes associated with PD phenomenon stress conditions. The PD signal has been preprocessed to compute the optimal state transition matrix using the Viterbi algorithm. The results show that the transition of PD pulses can be identified using the state transition matrix which display unique and significant changes in the discharge activity in insulating oil under different accelerated electrical stress conditions. © 2016, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

abstract={With the overwhelming acceptance and adoption of RFID tags, a variety of everyday automation activities are being systematically accelerated and accomplished across different industry verticals. The passive RFID tags can be easily observed within 20 feet and hence can be applied to supply a unique RFID code for every tagged entity. For granting more powerful two-factor authentication, fingerprint images of students and other stakeholders are also being carefully captured and stored in networkaccessible database systems locally as well as remotely for data and disaster recovery. This sort of arrangement significantly enhances the veracity of the participants’ attendance and participation in their learning and professional assignments. For example, for schools, colleges and universities, the attendance details of students and scholars can be minutely captured and leveraged. In this paper, we have explained a framework for highly accurate attendance system. We have described how the local and the remote (AWS cloud) execution of data capture, processing, and storage happens and the distinct advantages of cloud-based data processing. Considering the need for higher network performance requirements, we have demonstrated how the seamless convergence of RFID with Li-Fi communication is to realize heightened cloud performance. © 2016, Scientific Publishers of India.

abstract={Proffering context awareness facilities to end-users is a long-term objective of Ambient Intelligence (AmI). A context-aware system has to know the context information and understand what exactly is happening in a particular environment in order to build and provide distinct capabilities to the users and the occupants of the environment. However there are multiple challenges in precisely capturing the context or activity details from sensors and actuators deployed in the environment. There are possibilities for aggregating wrong data due to various reasons at different levels (sensor, network, etc.). Several technologies and mathematical concepts are being recommended to substantially enhance the quality of the sensor/actuator data so that the decisions being derived out of the data collected are right. The concept of fuzzy finite automata is used by most of the researchers to solve these issues (trustworthiness and timeliness of the sensor data). But it has turned out to be a complex affair. In this paper, we have empowered Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) with threading to enable correct decision-making out of data from multiple sensors/devices in any environment. In short, considering the multiplicity and heterogeneity of devices in our personal as well as professional environments, DFA with the parallelization capability is going to be the novelty and game-changer for precision-centric contextaware computing. The suggested method is verified and validated through a freely obtainable data set and the results obtained prove the simplicity and the correctness of our solution approach. © 2016, Scientific Publishers of India.

abstract={Robots equipped with a set of simple action skills should complete complex tasks, defined as the concatenation of a number of those basic abilities. Traditionally, planners have been used to decide skills to be activated, as well as in which sequence, like state machines. Recently, cognitive architectures like SOAR have been proposed to act as the reasoner by selecting which competence the robot should perform, addressing it towards the goal. However, they have been unidirectionally integrated: once the plan is completely designed by the cognitive architecture, it is sent to the robot, but no feedback is provided to the reasoner. Instead, our proposal allows to establish bi-directional communication between the reasoner and the robot. In this form, the reasoner can develop incomplete plans under the assumption that a part of the information to complete the plan for achieving the goal will arrive delayed from the robot's environment as well as the user. Our work develops this bi-directional communication between the SOAR cognitive architecture and the ROS (Robot Operating System) environment, usual in mobile robotics. The proposed architecture has been tested on a UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) Parrot AR.Drone 2.0, which acts as mobile robot, in a searching task. © 2016 The authors and IOS Press.

abstract={CuO and Cu2O nano/microparticles with pure phases have been synthesized from the same precursor by a hydrothermal method. Hydrothermal heating of Cu(OAc)2 produced CuO at 125 °C whereas pure Cu2O was obtained at 175 °C. Heating at 150 °C gave a CuO/Cu2O mixture. In contrast, Cu(acac)2 produced only Cu2O at all three temperatures. The pure phases of Cu2O and CuO nano/microparticles were confirmed by PXRD and XPS characterization. The mechanistic studies indicate that decomposition of the organic anion/ligand of the Cu-precursor played a key role in the formation of CuO/Cu2O nano/microparticles from Cu(OAc)2/Cu(acac)2. FE-SEM studies revealed the formation of CuO with a microsphere morphology (125 °C) and a micro-cup for Cu2O at 175 °C. Nanowires and micron-sized elliptical cylinders were observed for Cu2O synthesized from Cu(acac)2. However, calcination of Cu(OAc)2, Cu(acac)2 and Cu(NO3)2 at 500 °C produced crystalline CuO nano/microparticles with various sizes and morphologies. Further, CuO nano/microparticles investigated for industrially important aromatic nitro to amine conversion showed morphology dependent nitro group reduction. Smaller spherical CuO nano/microparticles obtained from Cu(acac)2 exhibited the highest catalytic activity. The reusability studies indicate that CuO nano/microparticles can be used for up to six cycles. Thus we have presented a simple method to synthesize Cu2O or CuO from the same precursor and demonstrated the morphology dependent catalytic activity of CuO nano/microparticles. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.},

abstract={Saving is really a good habit particularly for the common layman. With the understanding of the above, a study was conducted in Sriperumpudur near Chennai about the saving behaviour of households and the influence of demographics over them. Objectives: The study was conducted by the authors to know the influence of demographic variables on a whole in saving behaviour and specifically, to know the level of influence of demographic factors in savings, to identify the level of saving of the people from their income and to identify the nature of investors. Analysis: The descriptive research design is adopted by the researchers in this study. They have adopted the non-probabilistic convenience sampling method for the collection of sample and the exact sample size of the study is 457. The respondents are approached with the systematic self-administered questionnaire for data collection. The researcher has used the chi-square test and the cluster analysis for the data analysis and further execution of the study. The study was concentrated on Sriperumpudur town near to Chennai only. Findings: The study has major findings that demographic variables like gender, age, marital status, number of earning members in the family, annual income have influenced annual savings. It is also found that there is an association between different heterogeneous groups of households' investment in financial market and their annual savings. But it has been indentified that there is no association between education and annual savings. Hence it is concluded that the demographic variables are playing vital role in influencing the saving behaviour of the individuals. Applications: The study has contributed for the improvements in the area where saving behaviour can be investigated from the dimension of influence of demographic variables. There are different applications that are made to identify the demographical behaviour of the respondents towards their investment choice. This study can also extensively be applied in the case of classification of demographic and psychographic variables. Improvements: Different educational qualifications of the respondents found in this study and they are considered as School Education, UG, PG, and Professional Education. They have different qualifications and aims in the determination of the investment avenues but at the same time the qualification does not influence them to choose the investment avenue. But all other demographic variables have an influence over the choice of investment avenues and change the behaviour of the investors towards the investment process. It is also found that there are certain developments in the behaviour of the individuals regarding their investment choice by their demographics.},

abstract={Adder is a circuit that is combinational and calculates the sum of three (full adder) or two (half adder) inputs. Full adder can be cascaded to produce n-stages of adder. This cascaded adder structure is called as parallel adder. The sum and carry outputs of any stage cannot be calculated until the input carry occurs, this leads to a delay in the addition process. In order to overcome the delay, carry look ahead adder is proposed which is said to be a fast adder. To improve the speed of vary look ahead adder, Spurious Power Suppression Technique (SPST) is used. This paper discusses 8-bit adder consisting of three architectures parallel adder, normal cany look ahead adder and SPST carry look ahead adder. The results were simulated using Xilinx tools and as shown, the power has decreased for both the SPST carry look a liead adder and the SPST ripple cany adder.

abstract={Protein aggregation triggered by conformational changes is considered to be one of the major reasons for neuro-degenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Poly-l-lysine (PLL) undergoes the α-helix-to-β-sheet transition which is considered as characteristic of protein aggregation. Understanding the role of viscosity in triggering these transitions is the main objective of this paper, and we have found out the ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium ethyl sulfate (IL-emes) and Ficoll induce such transitions in PLL, by using various techniques including circular dichroism, quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), tensiometry and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Irrespective of pH, viscosity tunes the native conformations of PLL to beta sheet conformations. Thioflavin T binding to PLL shows that these β-sheets are amyloidogenic. At the liquid/air interface, due to destabilization of the α-helical conformation of PLL at pH 10 with increasing concentrations of ionic liquid, an increase in surface activity is observed. TEM analysis shows macromolecular assemblies of PLL in ionic liquid and Ficoll. This work is an attempt to give an analogy between viscosity and conformational changes of PLL and thus can serve as a guide for protein aggregation in neuro-degenerative diseases. Taking PLL as a model, correlation between molecular properties like conformation and viscosity, a macroscopic property has been made. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.},

abstract={Reactive oxygen species including include superoxide anion radical, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical, and singlet oxygen are capable of damaging DNA, proteins, carbohydrates and lipids in aerobic organisms. Inflammation is a bodily response to injury, infection or destruction characterized by heat, redness, pain, swelling and disturbed physiological function. Inflammation is a normal protective response to tissue injury caused by physical trauma, noxious chemical or microbial agents. It is the body response to inactivate or destroy the invading organisms, to remove the irritants and set the stage for tissue repair. It is triggered by the release of chemical mediators from injured tissue and migrating cells. Obesity is a significant risk factor for increased morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease and diabetes and it is also associated with many other medical conditions including cancer, liver and kidney diseases. Recently, studies have been intensified towards finding out a natural source of drug without any side effects. In this view, in the present study we have evaluated the antioxidant, antiinflammatory and anti-obesity activities of banana flower extract. From the results obtained, it can be concluded that the flower extract of banana revealed promising antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-obese effects due to significant total phenol content.},

The objective of this paper is to study the feasibility of calcined bamboo leaf ash as a partial substitute to cement and its effect on compressive strength, pozzolanic activity, sorptivity and porosity characteristics in hardened concrete. Cement was replaced with BLA with a percentage of 10% to 30% with a uniform increment of 5%. Fallen dry bamboo leaves burnt in open atmosphere were heated in a muffle furnace for 4 hours at 500°C to induce pozzolanic activity. The grade of concrete was taken in such a way that it will give a characteristic compressive strength of 20 MPa. The chemical composition of BLA was obtained by XRF analysis. The nature of BLA was assessed by XRD analysis and found to have an amorphous structure. The pozzolanic activity was ensured by ASTM lime test (ASTM C311 and ASTM C109). Other durability characteristics, like sorptivity and porosity, were performed as per ASTM guidelines (ASTM C1545 and ASTM C127) to assess the resistance of BLA concrete against sorption and the volume of voids. From the experiments conducted, it was understood that cement could be replaced with BLA till 15% with a little compromise in strength and durability characteristics and that this replacement was found to be an optimum one. © 2016 JUST.

abstract={V2O5 thin films of different thickness values were deposited over ZnO buffer coated layer on glass substrates using reactive DC magnetron sputtering technique. As-deposited ZnO buffer layer and V2O5/ZnO (VZO) thin films were characterized using the X-ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), UV-Vis spectrophotometer and interactive source meter to study the structural, morphological, optical and electrical properties respectively. The XRD pattern of the ZnO films showed preferential orientation along the plane (002) and VZO films exhibit polycrystalline nature. FE-SEM micrograph of the ZnO and VZO deposited films showed smooth surface with globular morphology. The optical constants and bandgap of the deposited films were calculated from the transmittance spectra and the bandgap of the ZnO film was found to be 3.26 eV. Electrical and thermo-electrical properties of the deposited VZO films were studied using the electrometer and four point probe method respectively. Electrical resistance of the deposited films was decreased with increase in temperature due to the phase transition. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Cadmium selenide (CdSe) / cadmium tellurium (CdTe) bilayer was vacuum evaporated onto well cleaned glass substrates. The influence of bottom layer (CdTe) thickness on various properties such as structural, morphological, optical and electrical were studied using the X-ray diffractometer (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM), UV-Visible Spectroscopy and I-V measurements respectively. The thickness of the CdTe layer measured using the stylus probe profilometer varied from 550 to 770 nm. XRD pattern of the deposited CdSe/CdTe bilayer shows polycrystalline nature and crystallinity of the bilayer is improved with increase in thickness of the CdTe layer. The root mean square roughness of the deposited bilayer evaluated from the AFM decreases with increase in CdTe bottom layer thickness and the roughness value increases from 4.08 to 2.66 nm. Energy dispersive analysis of X-rays (EDAX) results confirmed the presence ofCadmium (Cd), Selenium (Se) and Tellurium (Te). The optical band gap of the CdTe layers decreases from 2.1 to 1.7 eV for increase in film thickness due to the increase in the grain size. The electrical studies were carried out using two probe measurement and I-V and the resistivity of the film was also measured. The bilayer films deposited in the present work can be used to fabricate multijunction solar cell. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Genomes evolve not only in base sequence but also in terms of their architecture, defined by gene organization and chromosome topology. Whereas genome sequence data inform us about the changes in base sequences for a large variety of organisms, the study of chromosome topology is restricted to a few model organisms studied using microscopy and chromosome conformation capture techniques. Here, we exploit whole genome sequence data to study the link between gene organization and chromosome topology in bacteria. Using comparative genomics across ~250 pairs of closely related bacteria we show that: (a) many organisms show a high degree of interreplichore translocations throughout the chromosome and not limited to the inversion-prone terminus (ter) or the origin of replication (oriC); (b) translocation maps may reflect chromosome topologies; and (c) symmetric interreplichore translocations do not disrupt the distance of a gene from oriC or affect gene expression states or strand biases in gene densities. In summary, we suggest that translocation maps might be a first line in defining a gross chromosome topology given a pair of closely related genome sequences. © 2016 Khedkar and Seshasayee.},

The data which is stored in the cloud can be sensitive and at times needs a proper file storage system with a tough security algorithm. Whereas cloud is an open shareable elastic environment, it needs impenetrable and airtight security. This paper deals with furnishing a secure storage system for the above-mentioned purpose in the cloud. To become eligible to store data a user has to register with the cloud database. This prevents unauthorized access. The files stored in the cloud are encrypted with RSA algorithm and digital fingerprint for the same has been generated through MD5 message digest before storage. The RSA provides unreadability of data to anyone without the private key. MD5 makes it impossible for any changes on data to go unnoticed. After the application of RSA and MD5 before storage, the data becomes resistant to access or modifications by any third party and to intruders of cloud storage system. This application is tested in Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud Web Services. © 2016 Nithya Chidambaram et al.},

abstract={The security system of data transmission is the major aspects of all regions in today situations. Authentication is an important factor for secure transmission through wireless networking. The major problem of wireless data transmission is that the intruders are trying to track the original information or inject the false information. Cryptography technology provides the security system for transmission by using the symmetric key algorithm methods. The proposed system deals with the most secure transmission through wireless network by using the blowfish algorithm which is based on the lower end and higher end processor. The blowfish algorithm performs the action of encoding through ATmega8L processor and the decoding through LPC2148 processor. Lots of security systems were available for data transmission, but the existing system does not have the ability of powerful communications between users. This proposed system of prototype provides an efficient security system is facilitating by the symmetric key algorithm of blowfish algorithm. The encrypted and decrypted datas are displayed on PC via terminal window software. The primary goal of this proposed system is to achieve the major factors namely security, authentication, reliability, system speed and maintenance which are perfectly implemented.

The aerial parts of C. occidentalis possess favorable physicochemical properties with good nutritional value, such as high energy value, crude fibers, and vitamin levels. The X-ray fluorescence spectrophotometry data revealed that the sample is rich in minerals, especially in Fe, Ca, K, and Mn. Further, minerals such as Mg, Zn, Cu, Na, P, and S are present in good amount and depicted the nutritional value of the selected material. The plant sample is rich in phytochemicals such as flavonoids, alkaloids, lignin, tannins, and phenols. The presence of phytochemical constituents was confirmed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry profile and high-performance thin layer chromatography fingerprinting techniques. The findings stimulate the on-farm cultivation of C. occidentalis on a large scale to relieve the iron deficiency in local community, and it can be used as a dietary supplement to treat anemia. © 2016},

abstract={The price of fuel is sky rocketing and so is the pollution in the atmosphere. And with the rise in number of vehicles on road the demand for fuel is also increasing rapidly. A large amount of the fuel is used up to run automobiles. These automobiles which use IC engines have a very low efficiency of about 30% to 35%. The rest of the 65% of heat input is lost in various forms to the surroundings through cooling water, exhaust gases and radiation. Still the 35% of work is not utilised completely due to dissipative effect of friction. The present day customer expects his ride to be comfortable. And with rising temperatures automobile air conditioning is a necessity. However, this comfort cooling comes at the cost of higher fuel expenses. The unit needs constant power which is obtained from the engine, thus resulting in loss of engine power as well as mileage. This project aims at reducing the fuel consumption of the vehicle and thus increase fuel economy by reducing the load on the engine by using the excess heat available in the exhaust gases and implementing the vapor absorption system for air conditioning.},

But they must be considered in a different light with respect to crops. Natural vegetation is adapted to the climatic conditions with which it is associated. The emphasis of present work is to provide the weather patterns of winter day for January and February months during winter season have also been extracted using the association rule mining of data mining method. The extracted weather patterns are used for indicating the possible occurrence of extreme cool day before 24 hours and 48 hours over the coastal station Cuddalore (Latitude 11°46' N / Longitude 79°46' E) of south east India. The study exhibits that the proposed data mining model can predict the occurrence of cool day during winter with the help of local weather parameters.},

abstract={Omnidirectional robots can move in all directions without steering their wheels and it can rotate clockwise and counterclockwise with reference to their axis. In this paper, we focused only on front and back movement, to analyse the square- and triangle-structured omnidirectional robot movements. An omnidirectional mobile robot shows different performances with the different number of wheels and the omnidirectional mobile robot's chassis design. Research is going on in this field to improve the accurate movement capability of omnidirectional mobile robots. This paper presents a design of a unique device of Angle Variable Chassis (AVC) for linear movement analysis of a three-wheeled omnidirectional mobile robot (TWOMR), at various angles (θ) between the wheels. Basic mobility algorithm is developed by varying the angles between the two selected omnidirectional wheels in TWOMR. The experiment is carried out by varying the angles (θ = 30°, 45°, 60°, 90°, and 120°) between the two selected omniwheels and analysing the movement of TWOMR in forward direction and reverse direction on a smooth cement surface. Respectively, it is compared to itself for various angles (θ), to get its advantages and weaknesses. The conclusion of the paper provides effective movement of TWOMR at a particular angle (θ) and also the application of TWOMR in different situations. © 2016 A. P. Mohanraj et al.},

abstract={Modulation of immune response to cure various diseases has been a very interesting concept and becoming the field of intensive research worldwide. Widespread efforts have been made to identify immunomodulatory agents as prophylactic or therapeutic regimens to combat infections or to enhance the immunocompetence of the host. Immunomodulators have been gaining global significance now days because it is better to prevent disease instances rather to treat them. The use of traditional knowledge and practices as a drug discovery engine is time and cost effective as well as could lead to better success. Although a number of synthetic drugs are being used in immunotherapeutics, the adverse side effects associated with their usage such as nephro toxicity, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, bone marrow suppression etc., has produced an awareness to limit their usage and to search for safe alternatives. Besides their side effects, synthetic immunomodulators also incur heavy economic burden, hence there is a need for an alternative cost effective safe herbal immunomodulator. In this context, the present review focused on the immunomodulatory role of plant drugs which are used in Siddha and Ayurveda system of medicines in India. © protected.},

abstract={This paper addresses the issues of regulating the fineness and mill load of ball mill by using Kalman filter and linear Model Predictive Control. The MPC is designed by various simulation results with the help of MPC toolbox. The main objective of this paper is to reduce the energy consumption during production. This can be achieved by reducing the energy used or by increasing the product units for different fineness. In this paper, two MPCs are designed, i.e., MPC with dead band type I and type II to reduce the energy consumption in different manner. Usually, normal MPC is used to take control action to force the output to reach a set point. But in this paper, the designed MPC is used in a different manner to maintain the output within a range of set point and Kalman Filter is used to estimate sensor output state as none of the sensor gives accurate measurement. Furthermore, the performance of developed methodology has been compared with the normal MPC by simulation. © Springer India 2016.},

abstract={Electricity generation and environment protection are two important aspects of a coal-fired power plant. In this framework, it is required to optimize the boiler efficiency which in turn helps to generate maximum amount of power in an optimized environment. Boiler efficiency can be increased by reducing losses inside the boilers which are done using good quality fuels (Coal). This could provide environmental protection by minimizing the amount of green house gases that exit the boilers which also indirectly increase the efficiency of the boilers. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a nontraditional approach, applied to the observed and collected data from mettur thermal power station (MTPS). MATLAB tool is used for programming and simulating the results. The optimal result obtained from PSO is compared to the existing parameters which control the boiler efficiency and PSO technique is found to give better result to improve the boiler efficiency. © Springer India 2016.},

abstract={Caesalpinia bonducella L. belongs to the family Caesalpiniaceae is distributed throughout India and commonly known as Kazhichikkai in Tamil. In the present study, attempts were made to assess the physicochemical, phytochemical, nutritional and pharmacological properties of C. bonducella seeds. Powder microscopy revealed characteristics features of C. bonducella seeds. Physicochemical properties such as foreign matter (0.97%), loss on drying (8.83%), total ash (3.37%), solubility in water (28.8%) and extractive value in water (6.7%) were revealed by the sample. Phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of alkaloid (0.12 mg g-1), phenol (0.60 mg g-1), flavonoid (0.33 mg g-1), tannin (4.90 mg g-1) and lignin (74.7 mg g-1). The nutritional profile of C. bonducella revealed the presence of carbohydrate (18.4 mg g-1), proteins (17.6 mg g-1), fat (3.6 mg g-1), fibre (3.3 mg g-1) and energy value (73.6 kcal). Presence of different phytochemicals was confirmed in the hexane and chloroform extracts of C. bonducella using HPTLC and GC-MS techniques. The aqueous extract (1000 μg mL-1) recorded anti-inflammatory activity in terms of inhibition of protein denaturation (94.15%), inhibition of protease activity (32.40%) and HRBC membrane stabilization (81.66%). Strong antioxidant activity was noticed in aqueous extract based on the results of DPPH radical scavenging (90%) and lipid peroxidation (99.69%) assays, which are higher than that of BHT standard. Thus the present investigation provides scientific evidence for the folk-lore claims for medicinal value of C. bonducella seeds. © 2016 S. Manikandaselvi et al.},

abstract={Life cycle cost (LCC) analysis is currently a most valuable tool in the civil engineering construction industry and will be inevitable as resources become scarce. Selection of materials for fabricating components of any civil engineering structures will be based on LCC analysis. It is due to significant reduction in lifetime cost of construction, maintenance, repair and rehabilitation. In this paper, cost benefit analysis of three types of beam namely Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) reinforced, epoxy coated and steel reinforced beam was done. It includes the calculation of total lifetime cost, overall system cost and calculation the Net Present Value (NPV). Beams with over reinforced section and under reinforced section were considered in the cost analysis to have better understanding. A comparison was made between steel reinforced beam and GFRP reinforced beam to assess the benefits based on the economic aspects. From the results, it was found that good amount of cost-saving to an extent of 20% at initial stage and 40% with increase in age for GFRP reinforced beam over steel reinforced beam. The trend in variation of total cost for GFRP reinforced beam was consistent throughout its lifetime, whereas for steel reinforced beam and epoxy coated beam it was not so. Hence with the combined advantages of structural performance, serviceability, suitability for aggressive environments and economy, GFRP reinforced beam was strongly recommended from this study.},

abstract={Drug-eluting stents (DES) represent a major milestone in stent technology, saving the lives of millions worldwide afflicted with cardiovascular disease. Though a wide range of therapeutic approaches has been employed for treatment of coronary artery diseases, stent deployment has become the most extensively practiced method to open blocked arteries in comparison with surgical revascularisation. In recent years, the bare metal stent has evolved into more effective drug-eluting systems and the encouraging results from initial clinical trials have instilled hope among cardiologists to reduce the number of fatalities caused by cardiovascular diseases through the deployment of drug-eluting stents. Over the years, the stents have evolved from a passive framework that maintained blood flow through the blood vessels into multi-functional devices that could also serve to mitigate conditions leading to the blockage of the blood vessels while promoting re-endothelialization of the blood vessel. This review traces the evolution of the stents from the first generation structures to the modern versions that overcome their limitations.

abstract={A resistive gas sensor for hydrogen (H 2 ) was developed using CdO-TiO 2 nanocomposite films deposited onto a glass substrate in a thickness of typically 300–450 nm by co-sputtering. X-ray diffraction patterns confirmed the formation of a perovskite CdTiO 3 phase. Field emission-scanning electron micrographs showed spherically shaped grains which decreased in size on increasing the TiO 2 concentration, most probably due to difference in the size of the ions of Cd and Ti. The nanostructured films with lower concentration of TiO 2 exhibited good response to H 2 at an operating temperature of 275 °C and an operating voltage of 250 mV. The sensors give a 3 % relative resistance change on exposure to 500 ppm of H 2 , have a 45 s response time and a 90 s recovery time. The H 2 sensor described here does not require expensive additives and thus may find both civilian and industrial applications. [Figure not available: see fulltext.] © 2015, Springer-Verlag Wien.},

abstract={Aim: To develop more precise pharmacogenomic algorithm for prediction of safe and effective dose of warfarin. Materials & methods: An artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm was developed by using age, gender, BMI, plasma Vitamin K levels, thyroid status and ten genetic variables as the inputs and therapeutic warfarin dose as the output. Hyperbolic tangent function was used to build an ANN architecture. Results: This model explained 93.5% variability in warfarin dosing and predicted warfarin dose accurately in 74.5% patients whose international normalized ratio (INR) was less than 2.0 and in 83.3% patients whose INR was more than 3.5. This algorithm reduced the out-of-range INRs (odds ratio [OR]: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.30-0.79; p = 0.003), the rate of adverse drug reactions (OR: 0.00; 95% CI: 0.00-1.21; p = 0.06) and time to reach first therapeutic INR (OR: 6.73; 95% CI: 2.17-22.31; p < 0.0001). This algorithm was found to be applicable in both euthyroid and hypothyroid status. S-warfarin/7-hydroxywarfarin ratio was found to increase in subjects with CYP2C9∗2 and CYP2C9∗3 justifying the warfarin sensitivity attributed to these variants. Conclusion: An application of ANN for warfarin dosing improves predictability and provides safe and effective dosing. © 2016 Future Medicine Ltd.},

This tool uses ant colony algorithm for optimizing statically detected paths. This tool minimizes the number of paths to be tested and covers maximum anomalies, thereby ensuring a reliable system. The recursive traversal of the control flow graph along with artificial ants is performed and it provides an efficient set of paths by implementing all def-uses (ADU) strategy of data flow testing technique. The tool also provides a test suite for the evaluation of test results. The test paths are prioritized based on the number of visits and sum value of iteration performed.

abstract={Background: Diosgenin, a steroidal saponin from plants, exhibits many biological potentials. Herein, the cardioprotective role of diosgenin is studied. Materials and Methods: The effect of diosgenin, isolated from Dioscorea bulbifera, was studied on hypoxia-reoxygenation (HR) in H9c2 cardiomyoblast cells. The amount of diosgenin in the plant extract was analyzed by high-performance thin layer chromatography using a solvent system comprising of chloroform:methanol:acetic acid:formic acid (13:4.5:1.5:1). Cardioprotection was checked by (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Further, the release of lactate dehydrogenase, an enzyme released during cell death was checked. The proteins responsible for cell death (Bax) and cell survival (Bcl-2, hemeoxygenase-1 and Akt) were analyzed using Western blot to check the cardioprotective role of diosgenin. Conclusion:Supplementation of diosgenin mitigates HR injury, thereby exhibiting cardioprotective potential. © 2016 Pharmacognosy Magazine | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.},

abstract={In prokaryotes, translation initiation typically depends on complementary binding between a G-rich Shine-Dalgarno (SD) motif in the 50 untranslated region of mRNAs, and the 30 tail of the 16S ribosomal RNA (the anti-SD sequence). In some cases, internal SD-like motifs in the coding region generate “programmed” ribosomal pauses that are beneficial for protein folding or accurate targeting. On the other hand, such pauses can also reduce protein production, generating purifying selection against internal SD-like motifs. This selection should be stronger in GC-rich genomes that are more likely to harbor the G-rich SD motif. However, the nature and consequences of selection acting on internal SD-like motifs within genomes and across species remains unclear. We analyzed the frequency of SD-like hexamers in the coding regions of 284 prokaryotes (277 with known anti-SD sequences and 7 without a typical SD mechanism). After accounting for GC content, we found that internal SD-like hexamers are avoided in 230 species, including three without a typical SD mechanism. The degree of avoidance was higher in GC-rich genomes, mesophiles, and N-terminal regions of genes. In contrast, 54 species either showed no signature of avoidance or were enriched in internal SD-like motifs. C-terminal gene regions were relatively enriched in SD-like hexamers, particularly for genes in operons or those followed closely by downstream genes. Together, our results suggest that the frequency of internal SD-like hexamers is governed by multiple factors including GC content and genome organization, and further empirical work is necessary to understand the evolution and functional roles of these motifs. © The Author 2016.

abstract={Sensor fusion based localization techniques often need accurate estimate of the fast and uncertain scene change in environment. To determine the scene change from two consecutive LIDAR scans, this paper proposes a novel technique called 'keep zero as zero' polar correlation. As it name implies any zero in the scan data is kept isolated from scene change estimation as it do not carry any information about scene change. Unlike existing techniques, the proposed methodology employs minimization of selective horizontal and vertically shifted sum of difference between the scans to estimate scene change in terms of rotation and translation. Minimization of the proposed correlation function across the specified search space can guarantee an accurate estimate of scene change without any ambiguity. The performance of the proposed method is tested experimentally on a mobile robot in two modes depending on the scene change. In the first mode, scene change is detected using dynamic LIDAR, whereas static LIDAR is used in the second mode. The proposed methodology is found to be more robust to environmental uncertainties with a reliable level of localization accuracy.},

abstract={Recently, solar energy is one of key renewable energy resources and is gaining prominence rapidly. Solar energy can be made more viable by maximizing the efficiency of solar thermal systems. Solar tracking can be incorporated into the existing solar systems to yield a realistic solution and to maximize the energy efficiency. The solar thermal system can gain optimal energy during the day when the Sun's rays hit the system perpendicularly, since it receives maximum sunlight. The objective of this paper is to position the solar thermal system with respect to the Sun's movement. In this paper, an embedded system based design is proposed for the one-axis solar-tracking mechanism for the linear Fresnel reflector solar concentrating (LFRSC) system. A geared stepper motor controlled by an Arduino micro-controller is utilized to track the current position of the Sun using sensors. The LFRSC system is connected to the Arduino controller, which positions the solar tracker. The position of the solar tracker is adjusted using the input from two photo-resistors. Due to environmental conditions, sunlight may not fall on both the sensors. Under this circumstance the solar tracker is positioned accurately using the sun positioning algorithm (SPA). The accuracy of the tracking system is verified with the help of a control system. The proposed automatic tracker can be implemented with minimized cost and can yield a reliable structure for LFRSC system.},

abstract={The present study examined the cardioprotective role of methanol extract of the edible mushroom Volvariella volvacea against oxidative stress in hyperglycemic rats. Rats divided into 6 groups were administered with nicotinamide and streptozotocin intraperitoneally, except Group I (control). Group II served as diabetic control. Group III was given glibenclamide. Two groups (IV and V) of rats received (200 and 400 mg/kg) mushroom extracts orally for 30 days and Group VI received vitamin E (40 mg/kg). After the treatment period, lipid peroxides, carbonyl end products, advanced glycation end products, reduced glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione-S transferase, catalase, superoxide dismutase and non-enzymatic anti-oxidants (vitamin C and E) were assessed in the heart tissues of experimental animals. Glycosylated hemoglobin was estimated in blood. Electrocardiography recordings of the treated groups were also done. The results showed that mushroom extract treatment reduced the lipid peroxides, advanced glycation end products and protein carbonyls significantly and reversed the altered anti-oxidant enzymes, and the vitamins. © 2016, Bangladesh Pharmacological Society.

Apis florea is phylogenetically themost basal honey bee species and also themost distant sister species to the Western honey bee Apis mellifera, for which all OR genes had been identified before. Using our pipeline, we identified180ORgenes inA.florea,which is very similar tothenumberofORsidentified inA. mellifera (177ORs).Manycharacteristics of the ORs including gene structure, synteny of tandemly repeated ORs and basic phylogenetic clustering are highly conserved. The composite phylogenetic tree of A. florea and A. melliferaORs could be divided into 21 clades which are in harmony with the existing Hymenopteran tree. However, we found a few nonorthologous OR relationships between both species as well as independent pseudogenization ofORs suggestingseparate evolutionary changes. Particularly, a subgroup of theORgenecladeXI, whichhadbeen hypothesized to code cuticular hydrocarbon receptors showed a high number of species-specific ORs. RNAseq analysis detected a total number of 145 OR transcripts in male and 162 in female antennae. Most of the OR geneswere highly expressed on the female antennae. However, we detected five distinct male-biased OR genes, out of which three genes (AfOr11, AfOr18, AfOr170P) were shown to be male-biased in A. mellifera, too, thus corroborating a behavioral function in sex-pheromone communication. © The Author 2016.},

abstract={Stacking of the metal complex [(5,6-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline)(1S,2S-diaminocyclohexane)platinum(ii)]2+ (56MESS) onto the surface of two different fullerenes, a carbon nanotube (CNT), and a C60-buckyball was examined. The metal complex forms a supramolecular complex with multi-walled CNTs but not with buckyballs. Binding of 56MESS to the CNTs is highly efficient (90%) but can be further stabilized by the addition of the surfactant, pluronic F-127, which resulted in a loading efficiency of 95%. Molecular modelling shows that binding of 56MESS to the CNT is supported by the large surface area of the fullerene, whereas the more pronounced curvature and lack of a flat surface on the buckyball affects the ability of 56MESS to form bonds to its surface. The loading of 56MESS onto the CNT is via π-π stacking from the metal complex phenanthroline ligand and C-H···π bonding from the diaminocyclohexane ligand. 56MESS has 13 critical bonding points with the CNT, eight of which are π-π stacking bonds, but the metal complex forms only seven bonds with the buckyball. In addition, the loading of 56MESS onto the CNT results in a charge transfer of -0.111eV; however, charge transfer is almost negligible for binding to the buckyball. © The Authors 2016.},

Single crystal X-ray studies of AAP-Ru, ADABS-Ru and P2P-Ru indicates that Ru(ii) adopted a typical "three-leg piano-stool" geometry with pseudo-tetrahedral (AAP-Ru) and quasi-octahedral arrangements (ADABS-Ru and P2P-Ru). Supramolecular interactions (C-H⋯Cl, N-H⋯Cl and π-π) in the crystal lattice of AAP-Ru and ADABS-Ru resulted in a dimeric structure whereas P2P-Ru showed a supramolecular 1D chain. Importantly, preliminary in vitro anticancer activities for Ru-arene complexes have been evaluated against K562 (human chronic myeloid leukemia cell line) by means of MTT assay that showed strong anti-leukemic activity for AAPS-Ru (IC 50 = 12.46 ± 0.47 μM) and P2P-Ru (IC 50 = 11.8 ± 0.49 μM). The mechanistic studies indicated reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediated selective leukemic cells death without affecting the normal cells by AAPS-Ru. The initiation of apoptosis by AAPS-Ru treatment, particularly TNF-α induced cell death, was confirmed by pre-treatment with a selective TNF-α inhibitor. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={Maintaining product quality in cement grinding process in the presence of clinker heterogeneity is a challenging task. Model predictive controllers (MPC) are argued to be one possible solution to handle the variability, and the lack of models that relates clinker heterogeneity with product quality makes the MPC design challenging. This investigation addresses the suitability of two data-driven modelling approaches for cement grinding process-prediction error and subspace identification methods. Data collected from cement grinding process is used to build the model of the same. The collected data is used to build different candidate state-space models using the prediction error and subspace identification methods. The candidate models were validated using Akaike's information criterion and mean square error to study the suitability of these modelling techniques. The validation tests are used to identify the most suitable candidate models for the prediction error and subspace methods. The models developed in this investigation are inputs to design predictive controllers for cement industries and assure product quality in the presence of clinker grindability variations.

abstract={Objective: Free radicals play an important role in the pathogenesis of many disorders by damaging important biomolecules such as lipids, proteins and DNA. Natural antioxidants are safer, cheaper and potential therapeutics to scavenge free radicals. Hence, this study was aimed to assess the biomolecular protective effect of Cinnamomum zeylanicum bark, a culinary spice, on the oxidant-treated membrane lipids and DNA in cell-free systems. Methods: The total phenolics and flavonoid content of the bark were estimated. The extent of inhibition of lipid peroxidation (LPO) by aqueous, methanolic and chloroform extracts of bark was studied in vitro in three different membrane models such as goat RBC ghosts, goat liver homogenate, and goat liver slices which differ in architecture and lipid composition. The extent of inhibition of oxidant-induced DNA damage by the bark extracts was assessed in commercial DNA preparations such as pBR322, herring sperm, and calf thymus DNA. Results: The total phenolic content was 153.33±23.09 mg of pyrocatechol equivalents/g, and flavonoid was 33.66±1.15 mg of catechin equivalents/g of powdered bark. All the three extracts exhibited a considerable inhibition of LPO in all the membrane systems, and most significant inhibition was exerted by methanolic extract on the RBC ghosts. All the three extracts were able to revert the oxidant-induced DNA damage, and more significant DNA protection was rendered by methanolic extract on calf thymus DNA. Conclusion: The present study showed that C. zeylanicum bark is a nutraceutical rich in phenolic antioxidants that can protect biomolecules against oxidative stress. © 2016 The Authors.},

abstract={Structure-based sequence alignment is an essential step in assessing and analysing the relationship of distantly related proteins. PASS2 is a database that records such alignments for protein domain superfamilies and has been constantly updated periodically. This update of the PASS2 version, named as PASS2.5, directly corresponds to the SCOPe 2.04 release. All SCOPe structural domains that share less than 40% sequence identity, as defined by the ASTRAL compendium of protein structures, are included. The current version includes 1977 superfamilies and has been assembled utilizing the structure based sequence alignment protocol. Such an alignment is obtained initially through MATT, followed by a refinement through the COMPARER program. The JOY program has been used for structural annotations of such alignments. In this update, we have automated the protocol and focused on inclusion of new features such as mapping of GO terms, absolutely conserved residues among the domains in a superfamily and inclusion of PDBs, that are absent in SCOPe 2.04, using the HMM profiles from the alignments of the superfamily members and are provided as a separate list. We have also implemented a more user-friendly manner of data presentation and options for downloading more features. PASS2.5 version is available at http://caps.ncbs.res.in/pass2/. © The Author(s) 2015.},

abstract={A series of 2-imino-4-(trifluoromethyl)thiazolidin-4-ol derivatives were synthesized from one pot, three-component reactions of primary amine, aryl isothiocyanate and 3-bromo-trifluoromethyl acetone via in situ generation of both symmetrical and unsymmetrical thioureas. All the synthesized derivatives were screened for their in vitro anti-cancer activity against human cancer cell lines. Compounds 8l, 8r, 8s, 8t and 8u exhibited more potent anticancer activity in lung cancer cells (A549) than in the other three cell lines. Data obtained from analysis of the cell cycle showed that treatment of lung cancer cells with these compounds resulted in G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. Studies to understand the molecular mechanism of action of these compounds suggest that the compounds inhibit PI3K, pAkt and mTOR protein expression with concomitant up-regulation of tumor suppressor PTEN. These compounds contributed to LC-3 mediated cytoplasmic vacuolation leading to cell death in lung cancer cells. Overall, these compounds modulate cell death processes via inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR and MEK/ERK pathways, the key growth factor signalling pathways implicated in abnormal cell proliferation. These molecules can therefore be further tested in in vivo models as a potential regimen for efficacy and effectivity in lung cancer. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.},

abstract={Oxidative and reductive stress are dual dynamic phases experienced by the cells undergoing adaptation towards endogenous or exogenous noxious stimulus. The former arises due to the imbalance between the reactive oxygen species production and antioxidant defenses, while the latter is due to the aberrant increase in the reducing equivalents. Mitochondrial malfunction is the common denominator arising from the aberrant functioning of the rheostat that maintains the homeostasis between oxidative and reductive stress. Recent experimental evidences suggest that the maladaptation during oxidative stress could play a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of major cardiovascular diseases such as myocardial infraction, atherosclerosis, and diabetic cardiovascular complications. In this review we have discussed the role of oxidative and reductive stress pathways in the pathogenesis of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury and diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). Furthermore, we have provided impetus for the development of subcellular organelle targeted antioxidant drug therapy for thwarting the deterioration of the failing myocardium in the aforementioned cardiovascular conditions. © 2016 Gino A.

abstract={Antibiotic resistance is one of the most pivotal health menaces in the human population worldwide. Use of conventional antibiotics at high concentration for prolonged periods facilitates a selective pressure on the bacterial strain to develop resistance to these antibiotics. The ascent of multi-drug resistance in Vibrio cholerae strains is a key issue for alternative drug development against cholera. A drug that could curb the virulence of V. cholerae is an elective choice for treatment. A few research studies have been carried out to discover such alternative medication that has an anti-virulent property rather than antibacterial activity. Combinatorial antibiotic treatments along with anti-biofilm compounds have diverse effects on bacterial growth i.e. it can be additive, synergistic or antagonistic. In the present investigation, combinatorial action of 2,3-pyrazine dicarboxylic acid derivatives (QSIVc targeted against the quorum regulator, LuxO) along with antibiotics was evaluated. The results indicated that QSIVc could inhibit biofilm at a very low concentration (IC50 varying between 1 μM and 70 μM). The synergism of the compounds with the reported antibiotics (doxycycline, tetracycline, chloramphenicol and erythromycin) was evaluated by the checkerboard method. The fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) values varied from 0.0 to 0.5 for each combination. The ΔE value (750-1900), according to the bliss independence model showed that the QSIVc synergistically enhanced the inhibitory effect of the reported antibiotics against the multidrug resistant clinical isolates of V. cholerae. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.},

abstract={In web transport systems (WTS), parameter variations in transported material affects the product quality and integrity of the processed material. This investigation presents an adaptive model predictive controller for WTS in process industries considering the variations of the web radius with respect to time. The proposed controller uses a radius approximation algorithm for estimating the changes in web radius. The controller then updates the WTS model with the estimated changes in web radius that enters as the disturbance in the system. Then, the controller uses the model with disturbance estimation algorithm and an optimization routine to compute the future control moves that guarantee product quality, while simultaneously satisfying the physical and operating constraints of WTS. Furthermore, it assures product quality with web radius variations. The main advantage of the proposed controller is, it combines the predictive and optimality features of MPC with adaptation provided by an adaptive controller. Simulations on WTS used in paper industries illustrates the performance and advantages derived by employing the adaptive MPC against conventional MPC. Our results show a reduction in the peak overshoot, integral absolute error, and integral time square error by using the adaptive MPC. © 2016, Budapest Tech Polytechnical Institution.

abstract={Human Serum Albumin (HSA) has been suggested to be an alternate biomarker to the existing Hemoglobin-A1c (HbA1c) marker for glycemic monitoring. Development and usage of HSA as an alternate biomarker requires the identification of glycation sites, or equivalently, glucose-binding pockets. In this work, we combine molecular dynamics simulations of HSA and the state-of-art machine learning method Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict glucose-binding pockets in HSA. SVM uses the three dimensional arrangement of atoms and their chemical properties to predict glucose-binding ability of a pocket. Feature selection reveals that the arrangement of atoms and their chemical properties within the first 4Å from the centroid of the pocket play an important role in the binding of glucose. With a 10-fold cross validation accuracy of 84 percent, our SVM model reveals seven new potential glucose-binding sites in HSA of which two are exposed only during the dynamics of HSA. The predictions are further corroborated using docking studies. These findings can complement studies directed towards the development of HSA as an alternate biomarker for glycemic monitoring. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Repeated consumption of a chemotherapeutic drug in high doses often leads to drug resistance. The objective of this study was to develop a facile method to enhance the anticancer activity of the phytomolecules, acetylshikonin (AS) and beta,beta-dimethylacrylshikonin (BDS). Herein, we demonstrated that jacalin-capped silver nanoparticles (JAgNPs) loaded with AS/BDS induce maximum cytotoxicity effects on human chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), K562 at low concentration (100 nM), whereas for a similar effect about 500 nM of pure AS/BDS was required. Fluorescence microscopy data revealed the internalization of JAgNPs-AS/BDS complex into K562 cells. The intracellular localization of the drug caused the production of excess reactive oxygen species (ROS), elevation in the secretion of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), suppression in the production of interleukin-10 (IL-10), losses of mitochondrial membrane potential, DNA damage and apoptosis. The effective role of ROS and TNF-α in JAgNPs-AS/BDS mediated cell death was proven by pretreatment of cells with N-acetyl cysteine, a ROS scavenger, and pentoxifylline, a potent TNF-α blocker. The mode of K562 cell death was confirmed by annexin-FITC/PI staining followed by flow-cytometric analysis. Further, we disclosed the contribution of different caspase activation pathways in TNF-α mediated cell death. Taken together, our study elucidated that the judicious use of AgNPs might improve the therapeutic efficacy of AS/BDS against CML at lower doses. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.},

abstract={This research article aims at preparation of nickel-aluminum oxide (Ni-Al2O3) metal matrix composite coatings that were prepared from conventional electro-deposition process. Micron sized alumina particles were deposited in nickel matrix by electro-co-deposition technique. The primary electroplating parameters of current density, pH value of electrolyte, temperature of bath, amount of ceramic particles (Al2O3) in bath, and agitation speed were considered for experimental studies. Experimental design and run orders were framed by orthogonal array of Taguchi's approach. L27 orthogonal array was chosen for experimental design based on five plating parameters and three levels. The experiments were conducted by adjusting the plating parameters and the samples were prepared from electrolytic bath. Volume fraction of Al2O3 and micro-hardness of deposits were recorded for each coated sample systematically. The mean effect studies of electroplating parameters were investigated using Taguchi's approach. The S/N ratio values for the response of micro-hardness were calculated and analyzed for significances of independent input parameters. It was found that current density, pH, temperature and agitation speed were the most significant factors. A second order quadratic equation was developed as prediction model for micro-hardness. The predicted micro-hardness values were found to be in good agreement with the experimental results. © 2015 Politechnika Wrocławska.},

abstract={Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a multi-factorial disorder with high-penetrant mutations accounting for small percentage of PD. Our previous studies demonstrated individual association of genetic variants in folate, xenobiotic, and dopamine metabolic pathways with PD risk. The rational of the study was to develop a risk prediction model for PD using these genetic polymorphisms along with synuclein (SNCA) polymorphism. We have generated additive, multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR), recursive partitioning (RP), and artificial neural network (ANN) models using 21 SNPs as inputs and disease outcome as output. The clinical utility of all these models was assessed by plotting receiver operating characteristics curves where in area under the curve (AUC) was used as an index of diagnostic utility of the model. The additive model was the simplest and exhibited an AUC of 0.72. The MDR model showed significant gene–gene interactions between SNCA, DRD4VNTR, and DRD2A polymorphisms. The RP model showed SHMT C1420T as important determinant of PD risk. This variant allele was found to be protective and this protection was nullified by MTRR A66G. Inheritance of SHMT wild allele and SNCA intronic polymorphism was shown to increase the risk of PD. The ANN model showed higher diagnostic utility (AUC = 0.86) compared to all the models and was able to explain 56.6 % cases of sporadic PD. To conclude, the ANN model developed using SNPs in folate, xenobiotic, and dopamine pathways along with SNCA has higher clinical utility in predicting PD risk compared to other models. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Designing small molecular prototypes having potential to disrupt binding interfaces of pro-apoptotic-anti-apoptotic/BH3-only proteins is a promising strategy in cancer chemotherapy. Several natural and synthetic chemical compounds have been reported as inhibitors or BH3-mimetics to anti-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family playing essential roles in apoptosis. In the present study, chemical synthesis, structural characterizations and anti-cancer effect of 2-hydroxy-3,5-dinitrobenzamide (HDNB), a chemical compound identified on the basis of pharmacophoric features of hBaxBH3 peptide have been systematically reported. The chemopreventive effect of the HDNB was assessed on N-nitroso-N-methylurea-induced Wistar female rats of mammary gland carcinogenesis for the study period of 18 weeks. The carcinogenesis Wistar rats were subjected to oral administration of a low-dose (8 mg kg-1 b.w.), medium-dose (40 mg kg-1 b.w.) and high-dose (200 mg kg-1 b.w.) of the HDNB in three different experimental setups. Strikingly, a medium-dose (40 mg kg-1 b.w.) of the HDNB showed appreciable potential to reverse the abnormalities of various biochemical parameters in blood samples and as well in breast tissues to the values close to that of healthy control or to that of the standard (tamoxifen) control. The chemopreventive potential of the HDNB could be chiefly attributed to its ability to restore antioxidants and as well apoptosis inducing properties in Wistar animal models. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.},

abstract={Web transport systems (WTS) are widely employed in industries to transport materials as a long sheet (web) from one section to another. Maintaining web tension along the transit is imperative as it accounts for material integrity and quality. Hence, an efficient web tension controller is needed to provide performance optimization and reduced production down time. Conventional controllers such as PI controllers have several shortcomings, such as performance distortion in noisy environment, inability to handle interactions among the process variables and lack of optimality. This investigation presents an offline optimization-based PI controller tuned using particle swarm optimization (PSO) for WTS to control the web tension. Simulation studies indicate that the proposed controller strategy exhibits good performance optimization by maintaining constant web tension without violating physical constraints. © Springer India 2016.},

It is interesting to note that depending upon the circuit parameters the circuit shows both period doubling route to chaos and quasiperiodic route to chaos. In our study we have constructed two-parameter bifurcation diagrams in the forcing amplitude-frequency plane, one parameter bifurcation diagrams, Lyapunov exponents, 0-1 test and phase portrait.

abstract={In this research paper, a novel hybrid technique named KSVGRNN, which combines a multi-class support vector machine (SVM) and a generalized regression neural network (GRNN), has been developed for obtaining the composition of boiler flue gas mixtures. This hybridization was made by the support of K-means clustering algorithm and grid search technique. In the first phase, K-Means clustering technique has been utilized and the size of the training vectors has been reduced by employing a multiclass SVM. In the second, a GRNN has been trained for estimating the individual gas concentration in the flue gas mixture. The reduction of training vectors through SVM has been shown to improve the generalization capability of GRNN. Grid search has been utilized to obtain the optimal parameters of SVM. This hybrid technique has been validated by measuring its performance by processing volatile organic component (VOC) data acquired from quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) and SnO2 semiconductor type sensors utilized by other researchers in this domain. Further studies have been carried out to assess the discriminating and estimation capability of the proposed hybrid technique for real-time flue gas data obtained from two different analyzers namely ORSAT® and KANE®. The outcome of these studies, observations and analysis clearly indicate the exceptional performance of the proposed hybrid model in classifying and estimating the flue gas components in the machine (Analyzer) independent manner. © 2016},

abstract={Feed-grindability variations (clinker hardness) in cement grinding circuit affects the product quality and productivity of the cement plant. This investigation proposes a generalized predictive controller for cement grinding circuit that is more robust to feed-grindability variations. The main building block of the proposed controller is a new model for cement grinding circuit that directly relates product quality with elevator current and main drive load. The advantage of the model is that the effect of feed-grindability variations on product quality can be easily observed from the output. To develop such a model, this investigation adapts a data driven modelling approach. Experimental data obtained as measurements from cement grinding circuit in a cement mill located near Chennai, India is used to develop the transfer function model based on least squares approach. The model obtained from data driven modelling is used to design a generalized predictive controller whose objective is to optimize the product quality in the presence of feed-grindability variations without breaching physical and operational limits of the cement grinding circuit. The tuning parameters of the proposed generalized predictive controller is adjusted to meet performance metrics specific to cement industries. Our results show that the proposed controller provides better product quality in the presence of feed-grindability variations than other optimization based controllers such as the linear quadratic regulator. © 2017, All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={In eukaryotes, 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) play important roles in regulating posttranscrip-tional gene expression. The 3'UTR is defined by regulated cleavage/polyadenylation of the pre-mRNA. The advent of next-generation sequencing technology has now enabled us to identify these events on a genome-wide scale. In this study, we used poly(A)-position profiling by sequencing (3P-Seq) to capture all poly(A) sites across the genome of the freshwater planarian, Schmidtea mediterránea, an ideal model system for exploring the process of regeneration and stem cell function. We identified the 3'UTRs for ~14,000 transcripts and thus improved the existing gene annotations. We found 97 transcripts, which are polyadenylated within an internal exon, resulting in the shrinking of the ORF and loss of a predicted protein domain. Around 40% of the transcripts in planaria were alternatively polyadenylated (ApA), resulting either in an altered 3'UTR or a change in coding sequence. We identified specific ApA transcript isoforms that were subjected to miRNA mediated gene regulation using degradome sequencing. In this study, we also confirmed a tissue-specific expression pattern for alternate polyadenylated transcripts. The insights from this study highlight the potential role of ApA in regulating the gene expression essential for planarian regeneration. © 2016 Lakshmanan et al.},

abstract={There is an increased L-glutaminase market worldwide due to its relevant industrial applications. Salt tolerance L-glutaminases play a vital role in the increase of flavor of different types of foods like soya sauce and tofu. This chapter is presenting the economically viable L-glutaminases production in solid-state fermentation (SSF) by Aspergillus flavus MTCC 9972 as a case study. The enzyme production was improved following a three step optimization process. Initially mixture design (MD) (augmented simplex lattice design) was employed to optimize the solid substrate mixture. Such solid substrate mixture consisted of 59:41 of wheat bran and Bengal gram husk has given higher amounts of L-glutaminase. Glucose and L-glutamine were screened as a finest additional carbon and nitrogen sources for L-glutaminase production with help of Plackett–Burman Design (PBD). L-Glutamine also acting as a nitrogen source as well as inducer for secretion of L-glutaminase from A. flavus MTCC 9972. In the final step of optimization various environmental and nutritive parameters such as pH, temperature, moisture content, inoculum concentration, glucose, and L-glutamine levels were optimized through the use of hybrid feed forward neural networks (FFNNs) and genetic algorithm (GA). Through sequential optimization methods MD–PBD–FFNN–GA, the L-glutaminase production in SSF could be improved by 2.7-fold (453–1690 U/g). © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Objectives: The objectives of the study are to identify the service quality factors or dimensions and variables which influence customers’ behavioral intention of the selected public sector banks in Tamil Nadu. To develop and suggest an integrated structural measurement model by using the models of Service Quality and Behavioral Intention and to suggest service strategies for the enhancement of service quality of the bank for improving favorable behavioral intentions of banking customers. Methods/Analysis: The target population was of customers who indulge in personal banking at public banks in Chennai metro. The researcher selected X-Bank-(Disguised Name-Nationalized bank), based on the highest number of complaints registered with the banking ombudsman, as per scheme report 2014-2015 of RBI. Among the cities with complaints registered in India, Chennai city stood at the first place in having the highest percentage of complaints. Therefore, Chennai city was chosen as the area of the study. The sampling procedure used for the pilot study was, proportionate systematic random sampling. From each Public Bank of Chennai, around 250 customers were randomly selected using ‘personal contact and questionnaires were distributed to the customers of respective bank branches and they were asked to give their perception about level of service quality delivered by these banks. The data was analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling Technique. Findings: In recent years, the banking industry is going through big changes due to increasing flows of funds and with entry of new players and products and excessive use of technology has enabled banks to fulfill commitments, provide multiple delivery channels and resolve customer responses faster. It has become order of the day to provide best possible products and services and thereby ensure satisfaction and loyalty. In order to retain customers, banks have become more customer-centric. The success of this model depends on how well banks understand customers’ behavioral intentions. This can be achieved by improving service quality and thereby customer loyalty. This study is an attempt towards developing an integrated structural equation model by studying the ‘direct impact of service quality on behavioral responses of banking customers’ in public sector bank. The model attained the model fit and highlighted the significant service quality variables which impact the behavioral intentions of consumers. Novelty/Improvement: There is further scope for research for this study. It can be on improving the model fit by taking more number of banks either in Chennai from each banking sector or by replicating the proposed model with more number of banks in different districts of Tamil Nadu, or across India. It can also be done with different service industry. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Due to the toxic pathophysiological role of snake venom phospholipase A2 (PLA2), its compelling limitations to anti-venom therapy in humans and the need for alternative therapy foster considerable pharmacological interest towards search of PLA2 specific inhibitors. In this study, an integrated approach involving homology modeling, molecular dynamics and molecular docking studies on VRV-PL-V (Vipera russellii venom phospholipase A2 fraction - V) belonging to Group II-B secretory PLA2 from Daboia russelli pulchella is carried out in order to study the structure-based inhibitor design. The accuracy of the model was validated using multiple computational approaches. The molecular docking study of this protein was undertaken using different classes of experimentally proven, structurally diverse synthetic inhibitors of secretory PLA2 whose selection is based on IC50 value that ranges from 25 μM to 100 μM. Estimation of protein-ligand contacts by docking analysis sheds light on the importance of His 47 and Asp 48 within the VRV-PL-V binding pocket as key residue for hydrogen bond interaction with ligands. Our virtual analysis revealed that compounds with different scaffold binds to the same active site region. ADME analysis was also further performed to filter and identify the best potential specific inhibitor against VRV-PL-V. Additionally, the e-pharmacophore was generated for the best potential specific inhibitor against VRV-PL-V and reported here. The present study should therefore play a guiding role in the experimental design of VRV-PL-V inhibitors that may provide better therapeutic molecular models for PLA2 recognition and anti-ophidian activity. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Cationic lipids have been extensively studied for their ability to complex with nucleic acids to condense and consequently deliver them into the cells. However, developing safe and efficient cationic lipids for delivering nucleic acids is still an unmet challenge. Prior structure-activity investigations led to the path to understanding the lipid structure and its transfection efficiency. The trend in the transfection profiles of linker-based lipids is different from linker-less lipids. Influence of unsaturation in the hydrophobic chains has been investigated in linker-based lipids. However, in linker-less lipids, it remains unexplored. Herein, we demonstrate that the designed cationic lipid Lipid S-U with an asymmetric hydrophobic core having one stearyl (18:0) and one oleyl chain (18:1) showed superior transfection efficiency compared to its symmetric counterparts, Lipid S-S (hydrophobic core comprising of two stearyl chains (18:0)), and Lipid U-U (two oleyl chains (18:1)), in vitro. Mechanistic studies involving membrane fusogenicity with FACS revealed that liposomes of Lipid S-U have higher fusogenicity (89%) with B16F10 cell membrane than saturated Lipid S-S (66%) and unsaturated Lipid U-U (70%). Endosomal escape studies with confocal microscopy in HEK 293 cells revealed that lipoplexes of Lipid S-U had a higher endosomal escape and released the genetic payload in cytoplasm more efficiently than saturated Lipid S-S and unsaturated Lipid U-U. These cumulative findings support the notion that higher cellular uptake and endosomal escape resulting from fusogenic liposomes of Lipid S-U play a pivotal role in the higher transfection efficiency of asymmetric Lipid S-U. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={A triple layer system (TaZO/Ag/TaZO), consisting of tantalum doped zinc oxide (TaZO) as the top and bottom layers and metallic silver (Ag) as the intermediate layer, was deposited onto glass substrates. The top and bottom layers were deposited using an inexpensive home-made automated jet nebulizer spray technique (AJNSP) and the intermediate Ag layer was deposited using a thermal evaporation technique. Three different sets of samples with top and bottom layers having thickness values of around 50, 75 and 100 nm, respectively, were prepared, keeping the thickness of the middle layer constant (15 nm). The influence of thickness on structural, electrical, optical and photoluminescence properties along with surface morphology of the deposited triple layer systems was studied. A structural study revealed that the deposited films have the hexagonal wurtzite structure of ZnO, and an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic study confirmed the presence of the expected elements in the system. Optical studies showed that the overall thickness of the films influences only marginally the transmittance of the films. The decrease in sheet resistance with the increase in thickness is explained on the basis of a grain boundary scattering mechanism. Among all the films examined, the multilayer film with the 75 + 15 + 75 nm thickness exhibited the best quality factor (8.98 × 10-3 (Ω sq-1)-1), and may be considered as a potential candidate for transparent electrode applications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report in which a low-cost chemical technique has been employed to fabricate a triple layer system. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.},

abstract={The condensation reactions of 2-formylindole (1) or 2-formylphenanthro[9,10-c]pyrrole (2) with various aromatic amines afforded the corresponding phenyl or phenanthrene ring fused mono-/bis-iminopyrrole ligand precursors 3-8, which, upon reaction with BPh3 in an appropriate molar ratio, led to the new mono- and diboron chelate compounds Ph2B[NC8H5C(H)N-2,6-Ar] (Ar = 2,6-iPr2C6H39; C6H510), Ph2B[(NC8H5C(H)N)2-1,4-C6H4]BPh211, Ph2B(NC16H9C(H)N-Ar) (Ar = 2,6-iPr2C6H312; C6H513), and Ph2B[(NC16H9C(H)N)2-1,4-C6H4]BPh214, respectively. Boron complexes 12-14, containing a phenanthrene fragment fused to the pyrrolyl C3-C4 bond, are highly fluorescent in solution, with quantum efficiencies of 37%, 61% and 58% (in THF), respectively, their emission colours ranging from blue to orange depending on the extension of π-conjugation. Complexes 9-11, containing a benzene fragment fused to the pyrrolyl C4-C5 bond, are much weaker emitters, exhibiting quantum efficiencies of 10%, 7% and 6%, respectively. DFT and TDDFT calculations showed that 2,6-iPr2C6H3N-substituents or, to a smaller extent, the indolyl group prevent a planar geometry of the ligand in the excited state and reveal the existence of a low energy weak band in all the indolyl complexes, which is responsible for the different optical properties. Non-doped single-layer light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) were fabricated with complexes 9-14, deposited by spin coating, that of complex 13 revealing a maximum luminance of 198 cd m-2. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={The term 'ancient DNA' (aDNA) is coming of age, with over 1,200 hits in the PubMed database, beginning in the early 1980s with the studies of 'molecular paleontology'. Rooted in cloning and limited sequencing of DNA from ancient remains during the pre-PCR era, the field has made incredible progress since the introduction of PCR and next-generation sequencing. Over the last decade, aDNA analysis ushered in a new era in genomics and became the method of choice for reconstructing the history of organisms, their biogeography, and migration routes, with applications in evolutionary biology, population genetics, archaeogenetics, paleoepidemiology, and many other areas. This change was brought by development of new strategies for coping with the challenges in studying aDNA due to damage and fragmentation, scarce samples, significant historical gaps, and limited applicability of population genetics methods. In this review, we describe the state-of-the-art achievements in aDNA studies, with particular focus on human evolution and demographic history. We present the current experimental and theoretical procedures for handling and analysing highly degraded aDNA. We also review the challenges in the rapidly growing field of ancient epigenomics. Advancement of aDNA tools and methods signifies a new era in population genetics and evolutionary medicine research. © The Author 2016.},

abstract={Type II toxin-antitoxin systems (TAs) are small autoregulated bicistronic operons that encode a toxin protein with the potential to inhibit metabolic processes and an antitoxin protein to neutralize the toxin. Most of the bacterial genomes encode multiple TAs. However, the diversity and accumulation of TAs on bacterial genomes and its physiological implications are highly debated. Here we provide evidence that Escherichia coli chromosomal TAs (encoding RNase toxins) are 'acquired' DNA likely originated from heterologous DNA and are the smallest known autoregulated operons with the potential for horizontal propagation. Sequence analyses revealed that integration of TAs into the bacterial genome is unique and contributes to variations in the coding and/or regulatory regions of flanking host genome sequences. Plasmids and genomes encoding identical TAs of natural isolates are mutually exclusive. Chromosomal TAs might play significant roles in the evolution and ecology of bacteria by contributing to host genome variation and by moderation of plasmid maintenance. © FEMS 2015.

abstract={In the paradigm of drug administration, determining the correct dosage of a therapeutic is often a challenge. Several drugs have been noted to demonstrate contradictory effects per seat high and low doses. This duality in function of a drug at different concentrations is known as hormesis.Therefore, it becomes necessary to study these biphasic functions in order to understand the mechanistic basis of their effects. In this article, we focus on different molecules and pathways associated with diseases that possess a duality in their function and thus prove to be the seat of hormesis. In particular, we have highlighted the pathways and factors involved in the progression of cancer and how the biphasic behavior of the molecules involved can alter the manifestations of cancer. Because of the pragmatic role that it exhibits, the imminent need is to draw attention to the concept of hormesis. Herein, we also discuss different stressors thattrigger hormesis and how stress-mediated responses increase the overall adaptive response of an individual to stress stimulus. We talk about common pathways through which cancer progresses (such as nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2-Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Nrf2-Keap1), sirtuin-forkhead box O (SIRT-FOXO) and others), analyzing how diverse molecules associated with these pathways conform to hormesis. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Unfolding stabilities of two homologous proteins, cardiotoxin III and short-neurotoxin (SNTX) belonging to three-finger toxin (TFT) superfamily, have been probed by means of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Combined analysis of data obtained from steered MD and all-atom MD simulations at various temperatures in near physiological conditions on the proteins suggested that overall structural stabilities of the two proteins were different from each other and the MD results are consistent with experimental data of the proteins reported in the literature. Rationalization for the differential structural stabilities of the structurally similar proteins has been chiefly attributed to the differences in the structural contacts between C- and N-termini regions in their three-dimensional structures, and the findings endorse the 'CN network' hypothesis proposed to qualitatively analyse the thermodynamic stabilities of proteins belonging to TFT superfamily of snake venoms. Moreover, the 'CN network' hypothesis has been revisited and the present study suggested that CN network should be accounted in terms of structural contacts and structural strengths in order to precisely describe order of structural stabilities of TFTs. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Many bacteria secrete a highly hydrated framework of extracellular polymer matrix on suitable substrates and embed within the matrix to form a biofilm. Bacterial biofilms are observed on many medical devices, endocarditis, periodontitis and lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients. Bacteria in biofilm are protected from antibiotics and >1,000 times of the minimum inhibitory concentration may be required to treat biofilm infections. Here, we demonstrated that shock waves could be used to remove Salmonella, Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus biofilms in urinary catheters. The studies were extended to a Pseudomonas chronic pneumonia lung infection and Staphylococcus skin suture infection model in mice. The biofilm infections in mice, treated with shock waves became susceptible to antibiotics, unlike untreated biofilms. Mice exposed to shock waves responded to ciprofloxacin treatment, while ciprofloxacin alone was ineffective in treating the infection. These results demonstrate for the first time that, shock waves, combined with antibiotic treatment can be used to treat biofilm infection on medical devices as well as in situ infections.},

abstract={Crystalline vanadium oxide (V2O5) thin films were grown over zinc oxide (ZnO) buffer layer-coated glass substrates at room temperature by magnetron sputtering technique. Initially, ZnO thin films have been formed by oxidizing sputtered zinc films at different annealing temperatures (300–500°C) in ambient air for 1 h. The influence of ZnO buffer layer on the structural, morphological, optical and electrical properties of the V2O5 films was studied using the X-ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive analysis of X-rays, ultraviolet– visible spectrophotometry and four-point probe method. The thickness values of the deposited films were measured using the stylus probe profilometer. XRD patterns of the V2O5 deposited over ZnO (VZO) showed reflection planes corresponding to V2O5 and ZnO buffer layer. The optical studies showed the enhancement on the optical properties of V2O5 films deposited over ZnO buffer layer. The electrical studies of the VZO films showed that the resistivity of VZO films varied from 400 to 60 Ω cm. The enhancement in the optical and electrical properties may be due to the improvement in the crystallinity of the film because of ZnO buffer layer. © 2015, ICE Publishing. All rights reserved.},

As cloud computing has become a developing and emerging area, the need for a cloud becomes mandatory in working areas. The advantage of technology in their own data centers to evolve a private cloud. Due to the presence of private cloud and to fulfill its unique characteristics and special requirements, it becomes a challenging task to optimally schedule virtual machine instances requests onto nodes to compute when there are multiple tasks to satisfy. In this paper, we discuss about load balancing, which is to schedule task among various end users. The scheduling algorithm used is Round Robin algorithm. This algorithm reduces the response time and improves the processing speed. According to this algorithm the nodes are allocated to the virtual machines along with their corresponding task to a particular node in a cyclic fashion. Each node in the cloud is scheduled equally with the task until all the tasks in the global queue all allocated. © 2015.},

abstract={Background/Objectives: Cloud computing is an emerging area that is currently pulling towards many of us. Cloud deployment is a difficult task in this layered structure. Handling the cloud environment itself an optimally a challenging job. This can be made feasible by using fault tolerance and monitoring services. Methods/Statistical Analysis: Fault Tolerance (FT) facilitates the process or the component to work smoothly even though in the occurrence of failure. Monitoring is a technique collects the information and to predict the fault before it occurs. Proactive and reactive measures can take place to run the cloud environment with tolerance in failure occurrence. Reviewing the potential of FT and monitoring services is to make out the technique that serves in certain purpose. Fault tolerance systems are important for both cloud provider and cloud customer. Findings: Based on this idea, this paper provides the different or diverse fault tolerance and monitoring mechanism to improve the reliability in a cloud environment. Applications/Improvements: It presents the information about the various techniques and methods used in the FT and also a future research direction in cloud FT.},

abstract={Background: In past years, many methods have been implemented for maintaining and supervising uncertain data that may occur due to collection of data in new ways which results in missing values, erroneous data. The main aim of this work is to help the end user to get correct information about spatial data. Method: The behaviour of data as an outlier is the result of uncertainty. The challenge in spatial data sets is to cluster uncertain objects. Hence, unsupervised clustering can be used to deal with this type of data. In this paper, the difficulty of outlier detection with uncertain data is examined. Finding: To improve the performance and quality, Voronoi Diagram is used which partition the objects into each cell and helps to see the exact location of an object. The integral part is the pre-processing step of removing uncertainty to avoid wrong interpretation. Furthermore, CLARA (Clustering LARge Applications) algorithm is applied to produce the high quality clusters. It has an in-built function of outlier detection too and it is suitable for large data set. This algorithm uses Mahalanobis Distance to calculate the distance between cluster and its members, to remove outliers and reduce uncertainty for feasible and supporting inputs. This procedure can be a valid provision to be use in geo-database creation. Improvement: The methodology can be enhanced by designing the procedure to develop a Decision Support System (DSS) for spatial database creation.},

abstract={The evolving need for advanced care of patients at their homes along with the enormous growth in usage of mobile devices has resulted in the development of numerous mobile applications in enabling E-Medicine care. Cloud operations along with the developing mobile technologies is helping doctors in proper care of patients by enabling easy monitoring and assessing patient's health within their comfort limits. As such this leads to increase in frequency of sharing health information between doctors and nurses to provide better and safer care of patients. However in sharing information the hinders, privacy and safety issues may conflict with HIPAA standards. Through this paper we try to correct the privacy and security issues with E-Medicine care and cloud computing. We via cloud computing demonstrate a telemedicine application that allows doctors to monitor their patients remotely, and using this function as a base we tend to develop our model that tends to allow patients to share their health information with other doctors and medical professionals in a privilege and secure manner. The other indigenous feature includes the ability to handle big data and efficient counter mending.},

This approach has great applications in the fields of motion planning, object representation, tracking, information retrieval, topology representation, sensor distribution and location, facility location, forestry application, building constructions etc. Skeletons naturally provide a pixel to boundary mapping through which the path between points can be found in a terrain map. Many approaches for determining the skeleton of a terrain exist. In this paper, the different methods for Skeletonisation are discussed. Initially the various categorizations of Skeletonisation is discussed which is further followed by application of those algorithms for path determining. Quantitative measures for validating the skeleton are also discussed. Finally, the applications of Skeletonisation in various domains are elaborated.},

abstract={Image fusion, the process of combining multi-modal or multi-focus images to form a new informative image than input images. The fused image contains more information than their input images which helps remote sensing applications for image analysis efficiently. Many image fusion algorithms have been developed, but all of them introduced a term called as color distortion. The huge difference between the intensity of input images leads to the color distortion. The Intensity-Hue-Saturation fusion technique gives more access to the user to work on pixel by pixel. This method accessibility delivers the good fusion technique base to reduce the color distortion. We proposed an algorithm which solves the color distortion problem effectively and it can produce an output image as highly informative. The difference in intensity of input images reduced by injecting the intensity of the high resolution image. The proposed work performs better than existing algorithms and it is proved by statistical measures like a correlation coefficient, mean, standard deviation, ERGAS, UIQI and spectral angle mapper.},

abstract={This article mainly focused on cloud scheduling with constraint based decentralized task routing. The job of scheduling tasks across various nodes in a hierarchical network scenario is an exigent problem. The concept of decentralized distribution scheme proposed in base paper is time-consuming since it has to compute the availability function for each and every node. In this paper we proposed a CBDA (Constraint Based Decentralized Algorithm) which offers the expediency of being quick and "Make-span minimization policy" is implemented to reduce the completion time of the currently executing nodes. In our presumption, the submission nodes are semi centralized and it can store the availability information of the nodes or routers within its area. This paper considers the allotment of the tasks to the execution nodes which are unoccupied by other tasks. The dynamic allotment of the tasks to the nodes in the tree based approach is the major criteria for selecting the desired node. This paper proposes a trade-off between fully centralized model and the decentralized model by implementing a new constraint based decentralization scheme which saves time consumption and enhances efficiency of task scheduling. © 2015.},

This article concentrates in studying the model by simulating with different values and stating why generic value fit is taken into consideration, while others are not. The choice of generic value for the inactivation reaction of photopigment and phosphodiesterase is reasoned in greater detail. This paper states the flaws present in the previous mentioned computational model and put forth that photoreceptor works as a band pass filter and not as low pass filter which might help to overcome chromotacity adaptation in the given model.},

abstract={Local features of an image are used in many computer vision applications such as object detection and scene matching. The gradient orientation histogram is used by many local features such as Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), a widely used image local feature. This paper discusses various distance functions that can be used to measure the similarity between the local features described by the gradient orientation histogram. A distance function, based on the quadratic form is proposed for the SIFT descriptor. The state of the art distance functions - Euclidean, Chi-square, Manhattan and the proposed quadratic form based distance function are calculated between the features extracted from the images. Nearest neighborhood ratio strategy is used to find the corresponding features based on the distance measure. Correct matches are estimated using the ground truth transformation function between the images, present in the form of homograph matrix. It is experimentally found that the proposed distance function has an execution time reduced by 21% compared to the Euclidean distance for a similar accuracy performance. The proposed distance retrieves more number of correct matches compared to the modified Earth Mover distance which is fastest among the evaluated distance functions. The future work will be aimed at improving the time taken for computing the distance matrix between the feature sets and a better strategy for computing the matches.},

abstract={This article aims to focus on encryption based algorithm on ASCII value and Random number generator. Proposed algorithm has been developed with the view to achieve data security and prevent unauthorized persons from meddling with such secret data. An ASCII based conversion has been implemented to encrypt shorter length messages through a symmetric key. The algorithm specifically accommodates the concept of random number generation that makes it tough for the hackers to decrypt despite accidentally discovering the key. This concept also involves floating point numbers for encryption to enhance the difficulty level of cryptanalysis. Hence this algorithm will provide an efficient way to make it almost impossible for the intruders to track the message.},

abstract={Image encryption is used to protect the data of an image in the most secure way. In this paper, we perform encryption and decryption of the three color planes based on gray code effect and fast Fourier transform. Gray level codes indicate that occurrence of one bit changes from a previous state of current. This process allows the system to detect the error when more than one bit changes occur. It is more efficient than binary bit plane decomposition. The Fourier transform is mainly used to represent the frequency characteristic of a spatial domain image. The color plane scrambling process is done by combining three individual encrypted planes into one composite image. This method which is applicable for any type of image formats as bmp, JPEG, GIF. This paper gives a simple way to scramble the image in unpredictable way. It provides more security than other encryption algorithm. The original images can be retrieved using a correct security key which achieves better results than the other existing methods. By exploiting gray code and Fourier transforms it increases the difficulty of decoding.},

abstract={Cognitive radios are a good fit for overcoming inefficient usage of the available radio spectrum, allowing secondary users to utilize the spectrum when the primary licensed users are not consuming it. This requires secondary users to continuously observe their spectrum utilization to prevent interfering with the primary user's transmissions. However, an adversary can exploit this to gain unfair use of the spectrum. Such an attack is known a primary user emulation attack. To avoid these attacks, a method of authenticating the primary user's signal is required. This work addresses embedding such an authentication message with the binary phase shift keying and eight-phase shift keying modulation techniques, parity bits of the error control codes, and pre-coder bit of the modified duo-binary scheme, and analyses of the error performance have been carried out with the aid of their performance graphs. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={A density functional theory analysis on the encapsulation of sulphur mustard (HD), oxygen mustard (OM), and nitrogen mustard (N1) by cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) molecule was carried out using the dispersion corrected B3LYP-D/6-311+G(d,p) method. The encapsulation of HD, OM and N1, have favorable interaction energy and are found to be functional dependent. Amongst the encapsulated molecules, N1@CB[7] has the least highest occupied molecular obitual- lowest unoccupied molecular orbital gap, which indicates that nitrogen mustard can be reversible stored inside CB[7]. Molecular electrostatic potential studies shows that charge transfer occurs between the host and guest molecule during the complexation process. Atoms-in-molecules analysis at the intermolecular bond critical points, have positive charge density, negative Laplacian and close to zero value of total energy density, indicating the depletion of electronic charge along the bond paths, which implies an electrostatic nature of bonding. The natural bond order analysis of N1@CB[7] complex with highest strongest second order perturbation energies are due to the donation of lone pair nitrogen of CB molecule to the guest molecule and the back donation of charge, leads to the high interaction energy. Non covalent index isosurface clearly show the existence of hydrogen bonding and van der Walls intermolecular interaction between the guest molecule and the host CB[7]. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media.},

abstract={In this paper, the choice of power quality compensator is a DSTATCOM which constitutes a three phase four leg voltage source converter (VSC) with a DC capacitor. The control strategy proposed for the DSTATCOM is a neural network based one cycle control (OCC). This control strategy involves neural network block, digital circuits and linear elements, which eliminates the sensors required for sensing the load current and coupling inductor current in addition to the multiplier employed in the conventional method. The calculation of harmonic and reactive currents for the reference current generation is also eliminated, thus minimizing the complexity in the control strategy. The control strategy mitigates harmonic/reactive currents, ensures balanced and sinusoidal source current from the supply mains that are nearly in phase with the supply voltage, compensates neutral current, and maintains voltage across the capacitor under unbalanced source and load conditions. The performance of the DSTATCOM with the proposed artificial neural network (ANN) controllers is validated and investigated through simulations using Matlab software. The simulation results prove the efficacy of the proposed neural network based control strategy under varying source and load conditions. © 2015, Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

XRD patterns showed the formation of (101) crystal anatase facets. The grain size values of the film increased with increased deposition time, and the films deposited at 40 min exhibited a porous structure. Anatase TiO2thin films exhibited excellent sensing response, fast response and recovery time, as well as good stability and selectivity towards ammonia (NH3).

abstract={The present study investigated the stability of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) by the adsorption of humic acid (HA) and the mechanism of adsorption. The effect of humic acid on NP toxicity was determined by Escherichia coli (ATCC 13534), E. coli (ATCC 25922), and Pseudomonas putida (MTCC 4910). The nanoparticles showed low zeta potential and were least stable in the absence of HA. However, the negative surface charge of the particles increased in the presence of HA (0-50 mg/L) that reduced the propensity of nanoparticles to aggregate in water. A decrease in absorbance of ZnO NPs at 375 nm (plasmon peak) was noted in the presence of HA by UV-visible spectrophotometric analysis. A blue shift towards 370 nm was noted when the concentration of HA was above 20 mg/L. The HA adsorbed ZnO NPs showed higher zeta potential (>- 30 mV) and were highly stable. HA reduced the photocatalytic activity of ZnO and at the same time increased the photostability of ZnO. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Multimedia is ruling the digital era where data storage and transmission have gained huge importance. The refuge of such data transfer has been a chief apprehension and becomes the study in the limelight, probably, forever. The universal phenomenon is to send the desired data in disguise so that only the beneficiary can avail it. In this paper, a combination of space-filling curve with chaos has been used for encryption process. Initially, three chaotic sequences were generated using Chua's equations followed by quantification of those sequences. Key based on Hilbert curve is used for scrambling. For introducing confusion, the image is further scrambled using row and column shifting operations using the first two chaotic sequences used with space-filling curve. Then pixel replacement has been done by bit XOR between scrambled image and the third chaotic sequence. Finally, Gould transform is applied to enhance image authentication and tamper proofing of the encrypted image. In addition, deoxyribonucleic acid-based complementary addition rule is integrated to make the proposed scheme robust against statistical attacks, which also provides immense parallelism to generate the final encrypted image. The proposed methodology has been implemented in MATLAB 7.1. The results are compared with the existing methods. To validate the proposed system, image metrics like correlation coefficient, number of pixels change rate, unified average changing intensity, key sensitivity, cropping attacks, and noise have been computed.

abstract={Vanadium pentoxide (V 2 O 5 ) thin films were deposited over thoroughly cleaned silicon dioxide (SiO 2 )-coated silicon (Si) (100) substrates by reactive dc magnetron sputtering technique at various substrate bias voltages keeping the other deposition parameters constant.

The films were characterized for their structural, morphological, optical and electrical properties using X-ray diffractometry, field emission scanning electron microscopy, UV-Vis spectroscopy and four-point probe method, respectively. The crystallinity of the films was improved at higher substrate bias voltages, which in turn had influence on the optical bandgap value and electrical resistivity. The optical bandgap of the deposited films were decreased to 2·68 eV from 2·71 eV as a result of removal of defects. The temperature coefficient of resistivity value of V 2 O 5 films deposited at −100 V was found to be −1·9%/K.

abstract={The paper develops a lumped small signal equivalent circuit of a Single Inductor Dual Output (SIDO) Buck DC-DC Converter. It engages the principles of state space averaging technique to arrive at its equilibrium state from the operating modes of the converter. The philosophy involves the theory of linearized perturbation for articulating the small signal ac model at a chosen quiescent point. It forges to out leave the transfer function model and incorporates the attributes of a compensator to extricate the stability of the system. It includes the design of a compensator to entail the benefits of the mechanism in terms of a regulated output with lower ripple content and suit the demands of low voltage high power applications. The MATLAB® based simulation results exhibit the ability of the methodology through Bode plot and step response analysis and avails the response from the use of discrete components to validate the same. The Data Acquisition Module DT9834 helps to interface the developed compensator in MATLAB/ Simulink® with the prototype model of the converter.

abstract={The primary objective of this proposal is to explore the areas of applications for a Reconfigurable computing system and further to analyze the challenges in designing an Operating System suitable for such a computing environment. Method: In this paper we have discussed at length the issues in designing an operating system which will practically be suitable for a Reconfigurable computing environment. The different challenges faced by an Operatin System in handling the applications executed by a conventional CPU are analysed. The advantages of using the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) in Reconfigurable Computing System (RCS) to handle complex applications and to increase the efficiency and throughput of the system are also discussed. Findings: A primary comparison was made with all existing strategies used in Reconfigurable Computing Systems. The inferences obtained from this analysis gave a clear picture that the objective can be achieved by designing a new OS or making some modifications in the kernel of the OS. By achieving this task, multitasking between the applications or processes can be done frequently yielding a far better performance and throughput. The challenges faced by an OS in dealing with the applications executed by the RCS can be eliminated to a greater extent. Improvements: By adopting these kind of designing strategies for the OS in a system with the programmable gate array, there is a considerable improvement and performance of the device also the life span of the device is increased which is considered as most important criteria for any users in computing environment. The new architecture and performance analysis is a research prone area in many of the leading Universities.},

abstract={Robot Path Planning (RPP) is solved using Genetic Algorithm (GA) principle for collision-free navigation for the three dimensional static space to find the optimal path. In this paper, Layered Approach is employed where the whole three dimensional space is considered as layers of two dimensional spaces to accomplish the RPP to reach the target by avoiding obstacles and find the shortest path. The quality of the path is ensured by nearest neighbourhood approach. Implementation of the principle of GA to solve RPP is effective where the environment contains huge number of solution paths compared to the classical methods to obtain the shortest path from source to target. This approach is tested for different number of layers and the results are tabled. The path generated and optimal path obtained by the implementation of this approach has been compared with the cost of the optimal path obtained manually. © 2015.},

abstract={This study is focussed on the optimization of residential building roof insulation layers that includes weathering tile, wood wool and phase change material through grey relation analysis and numerical simulation techniques. The optimum thickness of insulation layers is determined for the quality objective of minimization of insulation material cost and energy consumption cost by air conditioning system over a life time of 10 years. For optimization of roof insulation layer, the insulation layers are varied to five levels with reference to the height of concrete (HC) layer and various combination of roof layers are obtained from Taguchi’s L25 orthogonal array. The 25 combination of roof structures are analysed by Numerical simulation technique to determine yearly heating transmission load and in turn used to calculate the cost of energy consumption for cooling a period of 10 years. As a result, the optimum thickness value of roof insulation layer - weathering tile, wood wool and phase change material are predicted as 0.33*HC, 0.33*HC and 0.066*HC respectively and this optimum value will have the cost of insulation and yearly electricity cost of cooling for 10 years as 92 $/m2 and 12.45$/m2 respectively. © School of Engineering, Taylor’s University.},

abstract={The main complication in betulinic acid (BA) based drug delivery has been observed due to its bulk structure. The present study demonstrates the potential effects of self assembled nano size betulinic acid (SA-BA) by treating human leukemic cell lines (KG-1A and K562) and its normal counterpart. Self assembly property of BA was investigated using SEM and DLS study which showed that the BA forms fibrous structure having few nanometers in diameter. Selective anti-leukemic efficacy study of SA-BA was investigated by cell viability assay. Mode of leukemic cell death and probable pathway of apoptosis was monitored by measuring ROS level, pro and anti-inflammatory cytokine status and expression of caspase-8 and caspage-3 by immunocytochemistry. Higher efficacy of SA-BA over non-assemble BA was monitored toward cancer cells, with no relevant toxicity to normal blood cells. SA-BA facilitated reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediated leukemic cell death, confirmed by pre-treatment of N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Induction of apoptosis by SA-BA treatment increased pro-inflammatory cytokines, specifically potentiated TNF-α mediated cell death, confirmed by expression of caspase-8 and caspage-3 by immunocytochemistry. This study explored the better anti-leukemic efficacy of SA-BA over BA and this modification will enrich the use of BA in cancer therapy. © 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Cancer is a key health issue across the world, causing substantial patient morbidity and mortality. Patient prognosis is tightly linked with metastatic dissemination of the disease to distant sites, with metastatic diseases accounting for a vast percentage of cancer patient mortality. While advances in this area have been made, the process of cancer metastasis and the factors governing cancer spread and establishment at secondary locations is still poorly understood. The current article summarizes recent progress in this area of research, both in the understanding of the underlying biological processes and in the therapeutic strategies for the management of metastasis. This review lists the disruption of E-cadherin and tight junctions, key signaling pathways, including urokinase type plasminogen activator (uPA), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene (PI3K/AKT), focal adhesion kinase (FAK), β-catenin/zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB-1) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), together with inactivation of activator protein-1 (AP-1) and suppression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) activity as key targets and the use of phytochemicals, or natural products, such as those from Agaricus blazei, Albatrellus confluens, Cordyceps militaris, Ganoderma lucidum, Poria cocos and Silybum marianum, together with diet derived fatty acids gamma linolenic acid (GLA) and eicosapentanoic acid (EPA) and inhibitory compounds as useful approaches to target tissue invasion and metastasis as well as other hallmark areas of cancer. Together, these strategies could represent new, inexpensive, low toxicity strategies to aid in the management of cancer metastasis as well as having holistic effects against other cancer hallmarks. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Genomic instability can initiate cancer, augment progression, and influence the overall prognosis of the affected patient. Genomic instability arises from many different pathways, such as telomere damage, centrosome amplification, epigenetic modifications, and DNA damage from endogenous and exogenous sources, and can be perpetuating, or limiting, through the induction of mutations or aneuploidy, both enabling and catastrophic. Many cancer treatments induce DNA damage to impair cell division on a global scale but it is accepted that personalized treatments, those that are tailored to the particular patient and type of cancer, must also be developed. In this review, we detail the mechanisms from which genomic instability arises and can lead to cancer, as well as treatments and measures that prevent genomic instability or take advantage of the cellular defects caused by genomic instability. In particular, we identify and discuss five priority targets against genomic instability: (1) prevention of DNA damage; (2) enhancement of DNA repair; (3) targeting deficient DNA repair; (4) impairing centrosome clustering; and, (5) inhibition of telomerase activity. Moreover, we highlight vitamin D and B, selenium, carotenoids, PARP inhibitors, resveratrol, and isothiocyanates as priority approaches against genomic instability. The prioritized target sites and approaches were cross validated to identify potential synergistic effects on a number of important areas of cancer biology. © 2015 The Authors.},

abstract={The evasion of anti-growth signaling is an important characteristic of cancer cells. In order to continue to proliferate, cancer cells must somehow uncouple themselves from the many signals that exist to slow down cell growth. Here, we define the anti-growth signaling process, and review several important pathways involved in growth signaling: p53, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), retinoblastoma protein (Rb), Hippo, growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), AT-rich interactive domain 1A (ARID1A), Notch, insulin-like growth factor (IGF), and Krüppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) pathways. Aberrations in these processes in cancer cells involve mutations and thus the suppression of genes that prevent growth, as well as mutation and activation of genes involved in driving cell growth. Using these pathways as examples, we prioritize molecular targets that might be leveraged to promote anti-growth signaling in cancer cells. Interestingly, naturally occurring phytochemicals found in human diets (either singly or as mixtures) may promote anti-growth signaling, and do so without the potentially adverse effects associated with synthetic chemicals. We review examples of naturally occurring phytochemicals that may be applied to prevent cancer by antagonizing growth signaling, and propose one phytochemical for each pathway. These are: epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) for the Rb pathway, luteolin for p53, curcumin for PTEN, porphyrins for Hippo, genistein for GDF15, resveratrol for ARID1A, withaferin A for Notch and diguelin for the IGF1-receptor pathway. The coordination of anti-growth signaling and natural compound studies will provide insight into the future application of these compounds in the clinical setting. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={One of the hallmarks of malignant cell populations is the ability to undergo continuous proliferation. This property allows clonal lineages to acquire sequential aberrations that can fuel increasingly autonomous growth, invasiveness, and therapeutic resistance. Innate cellular mechanisms have evolved to regulate replicative potential as a hedge against malignant progression. When activated in the absence of normal terminal differentiation cues, these mechanisms can result in a state of persistent cytostasis. This state, termed "senescence," can be triggered by intrinsic cellular processes such as telomere dysfunction and oncogene expression, and by exogenous factors such as DNA damaging agents or oxidative environments. Despite differences in upstream signaling, senescence often involves convergent interdependent activation of tumor suppressors p53 and p16/pRB, but can be induced, albeit with reduced sensitivity, when these suppressors are compromised. Doses of conventional genotoxic drugs required to achieve cancer cell senescence are often much lower than doses required to achieve outright cell death. Additional therapies, such as those targeting cyclin dependent kinases or components of the PI3K signaling pathway, may induce senescence specifically in cancer cells by circumventing defects in tumor suppressor pathways or exploiting cancer cells' heightened requirements for telomerase. Such treatments sufficient to induce cancer cell senescence could provide increased patient survival with fewer and less severe side effects than conventional cytotoxic regimens. This positive aspect is countered by important caveats regarding senescence reversibility, genomic instability, and paracrine effects that may increase heterogeneity and adaptive resistance of surviving cancer cells. Nevertheless, agents that effectively disrupt replicative immortality will likely be valuable components of new combinatorial approaches to cancer therapy. © 2015 The Authors.},

abstract={Cancer arises in the context of an in vivo tumor microenvironment. This microenvironment is both a cause and consequence of tumorigenesis. Tumor and host cells co-evolve dynamically through indirect and direct cellular interactions, eliciting multiscale effects on many biological programs, including cellular proliferation, growth, and metabolism, as well as angiogenesis and hypoxia and innate and adaptive immunity. Here we highlight specific biological processes that could be exploited as targets for the prevention and therapy of cancer. Specifically, we describe how inhibition of targets such as cholesterol synthesis and metabolites, reactive oxygen species and hypoxia, macrophage activation and conversion, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase regulation of dendritic cells, vascular endothelial growth factor regulation of angiogenesis, fibrosis inhibition, endoglin, and Janus kinase signaling emerge as examples of important potential nexuses in the regulation of tumorigenesis and the tumor microenvironment that can be targeted. We have also identified therapeutic agents as approaches, in particular natural products such as berberine, resveratrol, onionin A, epigallocatechin gallate, genistein, curcumin, naringenin, desoxyrhapontigenin, piperine, and zerumbone, that may warrant further investigation to target the tumor microenvironment for the treatment and/or prevention of cancer. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Deregulation of angiogenesis - the growth of new blood vessels from an existing vasculature - is a main driving force in many severe human diseases including cancer. As such, tumor angiogenesis is important for delivering oxygen and nutrients to growing tumors, and therefore considered an essential pathologic feature of cancer, while also playing a key role in enabling other aspects of tumor pathology such as metabolic deregulation and tumor dissemination/metastasis. Recently, inhibition of tumor angiogenesis has become a clinical anti-cancer strategy in line with chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery, which underscore the critical importance of the angiogenic switch during early tumor development. Unfortunately the clinically approved anti-angiogenic drugs in use today are only effective in a subset of the patients, and many who initially respond develop resistance over time. Also, some of the anti-angiogenic drugs are toxic and it would be of great importance to identify alternative compounds, which could overcome these drawbacks and limitations of the currently available therapy. Finding "the most important target" may, however, prove a very challenging approach as the tumor environment is highly diverse, consisting of many different cell types, all of which may contribute to tumor angiogenesis. Furthermore, the tumor cells themselves are genetically unstable, leading to a progressive increase in the number of different angiogenic factors produced as the cancer progresses to advanced stages. As an alternative approach to targeted therapy, options to broadly interfere with angiogenic signals by a mixture of non-toxic natural compound with pleiotropic actions were viewed by this team as an opportunity to develop a complementary anti-angiogenesis treatment option. As a part of the "Halifax Project" within the "Getting to know cancer" framework, we have here, based on a thorough review of the literature, identified 10 important aspects of tumor angiogenesis and the pathological tumor vasculature which would be well suited as targets for anti-angiogenic therapy: (1) endothelial cell migration/tip cell formation, (2) structural abnormalities of tumor vessels, (3) hypoxia, (4) lymphangiogenesis, (5) elevated interstitial fluid pressure, (6) poor perfusion, (7) disrupted circadian rhythms, (8) tumor promoting inflammation, (9) tumor promoting fibroblasts and (10) tumor cell metabolism/acidosis. Following this analysis, we scrutinized the available literature on broadly acting anti-angiogenic natural products, with a focus on finding qualitative information on phytochemicals which could inhibit these targets and came up with 10 prototypical phytochemical compounds: (1) oleanolic acid, (2) tripterine, (3) silibinin, (4) curcumin, (5) epigallocatechin-gallate, (6) kaempferol, (7) melatonin, (8) enterolactone, (9) withaferin A and (10) resveratrol. We suggest that these plant-derived compounds could be combined to constitute a broader acting and more effective inhibitory cocktail at doses that would not be likely to cause excessive toxicity. All the targets and phytochemical approaches were further cross-validated against their effects on other essential tumorigenic pathways (based on the "hallmarks" of cancer) in order to discover possible synergies or potentially harmful interactions, and were found to generally also have positive involvement in/effects on these other aspects of tumor biology. The aim is that this discussion could lead to the selection of combinations of such anti-angiogenic compounds which could be used in potent anti-tumor cocktails, for enhanced therapeutic efficacy, reduced toxicity and circumvention of single-agent anti-angiogenic resistance, as well as for possible use in primary or secondary cancer prevention strategies. © 2015 The Authors.},

abstract={Cancer immune evasion is a major stumbling block in designing effective anticancer therapeutic strategies. Although considerable progress has been made in understanding how cancers evade destructive immunity, measures to counteract tumor escape have not kept pace. There are a number of factors that contribute to tumor persistence despite having a normal host immune system. Immune editing is one of the key aspects why tumors evade surveillance causing the tumors to lie dormant in patients for years through "equilibrium" and "senescence" before re-emerging. In addition, tumors exploit several immunological processes such as targeting the regulatory T cell function or their secretions, antigen presentation, modifying the production of immune suppressive mediators, tolerance and immune deviation. Besides these, tumor heterogeneity and metastasis also play a critical role in tumor growth. A number of potential targets like promoting Th1, NK cell, γδ T cell responses, inhibiting Treg functionality, induction of IL-12, use of drugs including phytochemicals have been designed to counter tumor progression with much success. Some natural agents and phytochemicals merit further study. For example, use of certain key polysaccharide components from mushrooms and plants have shown to possess therapeutic impact on tumor-imposed genetic instability, anti-growth signaling, replicative immortality, dysregulated metabolism etc. In this review, we will discuss the advances made toward understanding the basis of cancer immune evasion and summarize the efficacy of various therapeutic measures and targets that have been developed or are being investigated to enhance tumor rejection. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Cancers harbor significant genetic heterogeneity and patterns of relapse following many therapies are due to evolved resistance to treatment. While efforts have been made to combine targeted therapies, significant levels of toxicity have stymied efforts to effectively treat cancer with multi-drug combinations using currently approved therapeutics. We discuss the relationship between tumor-promoting inflammation and cancer as part of a larger effort to develop a broad-spectrum therapeutic approach aimed at a wide range of targets to address this heterogeneity. Specifically, macrophage migration inhibitory factor, cyclooxygenase-2, transcription factor nuclear factor-κB, tumor necrosis factor alpha, inducible nitric oxide synthase, protein kinase B, and CXC chemokines are reviewed as important antiinflammatory targets while curcumin, resveratrol, epigallocatechin gallate, genistein, lycopene, and anthocyanins are reviewed as low-cost, low toxicity means by which these targets might all be reached simultaneously. Future translational work will need to assess the resulting synergies of rationally designed antiinflammatory mixtures (employing low-toxicity constituents), and then combine this with similar approaches targeting the most important pathways across the range of cancer hallmark phenotypes. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Apoptosis or programmed cell death is natural way of removing aged cells from the body. Most of the anti-cancer therapies trigger apoptosis induction and related cell death networks to eliminate malignant cells. However, in cancer, de-regulated apoptotic signaling, particularly the activation of an anti-apoptotic systems, allows cancer cells to escape this program leading to uncontrolled proliferation resulting in tumor survival, therapeutic resistance and recurrence of cancer. This resistance is a complicated phenomenon that emanates from the interactions of various molecules and signaling pathways. In this comprehensive review we discuss the various factors contributing to apoptosis resistance in cancers. The key resistance targets that are discussed include (1) Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 proteins; (2) autophagy processes; (3) necrosis and necroptosis; (4) heat shock protein signaling; (5) the proteasome pathway; (6) epigenetic mechanisms; and (7) aberrant nuclear export signaling. The shortcomings of current therapeutic modalities are highlighted and a broad spectrum strategy using approaches including (a) gossypol; (b) epigallocatechin-3-gallate; (c) UMI-77 (d) triptolide and (e) selinexor that can be used to overcome cell death resistance is presented. This review provides a roadmap for the design of successful anti-cancer strategies that overcome resistance to apoptosis for better therapeutic outcome in patients with cancer. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Proliferation is an important part of cancer development and progression. This is manifest by altered expression and/or activity of cell cycle related proteins. Constitutive activation of many signal transduction pathways also stimulates cell growth. Early steps in tumor development are associated with a fibrogenic response and the development of a hypoxic environment which favors the survival and proliferation of cancer stem cells. Part of the survival strategy of cancer stem cells may manifested by alterations in cell metabolism. Once tumors appear, growth and metastasis may be supported by overproduction of appropriate hormones (in hormonally dependent cancers), by promoting angiogenesis, by undergoing epithelial to mesenchymal transition, by triggering autophagy, and by taking cues from surrounding stromal cells. A number of natural compounds (e.g., curcumin, resveratrol, indole-3-carbinol, brassinin, sulforaphane, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, genistein, ellagitannins, lycopene and quercetin) have been found to inhibit one or more pathways that contribute to proliferation (e.g., hypoxia inducible factor 1, nuclear factor kappa B, phosphoinositide 3 kinase/Akt, insulin-like growth factor receptor 1, Wnt, cell cycle associated proteins, as well as androgen and estrogen receptor signaling). These data, in combination with bioinformatics analyses, will be very important for identifying signaling pathways and molecular targets that may provide early diagnostic markers and/or critical targets for the development of new drugs or drug combinations that block tumor formation and progression. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Cancer is a disease characterized by unrestrained cellular proliferation. In order to sustain growth, cancer cells undergo a complex metabolic rearrangement characterized by changes in metabolic pathways involved in energy production and biosynthetic processes. The relevance of the metabolic transformation of cancer cells has been recently included in the updated version of the review "Hallmarks of Cancer", where dysregulation of cellular metabolism was included as an emerging hallmark. While several lines of evidence suggest that metabolic rewiring is orchestrated by the concerted action of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, in some circumstances altered metabolism can play a primary role in oncogenesis. Recently, mutations of cytosolic and mitochondrial enzymes involved in key metabolic pathways have been associated with hereditary and sporadic forms of cancer. Together, these results demonstrate that aberrant metabolism, once seen just as an epiphenomenon of oncogenic reprogramming, plays a key role in oncogenesis with the power to control both genetic and epigenetic events in cells. In this review, we discuss the relationship between metabolism and cancer, as part of a larger effort to identify a broad-spectrum of therapeutic approaches. We focus on major alterations in nutrient metabolism and the emerging link between metabolism and epigenetics. Finally, we discuss potential strategies to manipulate metabolism in cancer and tradeoffs that should be considered. More research on the suite of metabolic alterations in cancer holds the potential to discover novel approaches to treat it. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Advancements in wireless communication and computing devices have made Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) interesting. Since WSN is deployed in hostile environments, the security becomes a common concern. WSN demands for lightweight security schemes due to the fact that the nodes in the networks are resource constrained. In order to provide secure data transmission in wireless sensor networks, cryptographic algorithms has to be incorporated. RC4 is one of the commonly used stream cipher due to its speed and simplicity in implementation. The drawback of RC4 is weakness in the permutation of internal state table during initial phase. To overcome the limitations in existing RC4, RC4 stream cipher with modified state table is proposed. The system reduces the known outputs of the internal state and also improves the execution speed. Modification is made on computational steps of the initialisation phase. The modified method tends to provide high degree of randomness in the permutation of the state variable than the original RC4. The algorithm design is targeted to encrypt/decrypt 8-bit ADC reading of TICC2431.},

The 8:2 and 9:1 P/G hydrogels exhibited comparable pore size and porosity (P > 0.05). The tensile strength of the fabricated 8:2 and 9:1 P/G hydrogel scaffolds were found to be in accordance with native human liver. Pore interconnectivity of both the P/G hydrogel scaffolds was confirmed by scanning electron micrographs and liquid displacement method. Further galactose containing hydrogel promoted cell–cell and cell-hydrogel interaction, aiding cellular aggregation leading to spheroids formation compared to void P/G hydrogel by 7 days. Hence, galactose containing P/G hydrogel could be more promising substrate as it showed significantly higher cell proliferation and albumin secretion for 21 days when compared to non-galactose P/G hydrogels (P < 0.05). © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Computational experiments were performed to study the influence of microchannel width and aspect ratio on performance of a four-compartment, microchannel heat sink with dedicated coolant inlet and outlet for each compartment. Wide range of coolant velocity (0.25-2 m/s) & aspect ratio (2-10) and a reasonable range of microchannel width (100-200 μm) have been simulated. The appropriate microchannel width and aspect ratio were found to be 200 μm and 6, as evidenced from lowest total thermal resistance and lowest non-uniformity of substrate temperature at comparable power consumption among different microchannel widths and aspect ratios simulated. A new parameter 'ω' has been proposed for representation of substrate temperature gradient considering maximum, average and minimum substrate temperatures. Correlations have been developed for prediction of dimensionless pumping power, Nusselt number and dimensionless total thermal resistance.

The bias voltage drives the electrons across V<inf>2</inf>O<inf>5</inf> scattering region, where the transmission along V<inf>2</inf>O<inf>5</inf> molecular device mainly depends on the bias voltage. The findings of the present work give insights to fine-tune the transport property of V<inf>2</inf>O<inf>5</inf> molecular device upon varying the bias voltage. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Tumor microenvironment play role in angiogenesis and carcinogenesis. Etoposide, a known topoisomerase II inhibitor induces DNA damage resulting in cell cycle arrest. We developed a novel Etoposide analogue, Quinazolino-4β-amidopodophyllotoxin (C-10) that show better efficacy in regulating cell proliferation and angiogenesis. We evaluated its role on expression of microRNAs-15,16,17 and 221 and its targets Bcl-2, STAT3 and VEGF that dictate cell proliferation and angiogenesis. Docking studies clearly demonstrated the binding of Etoposide and C-10 to STAT3. We conclude that combination of Etoposide or C-10 with miR-15,16,17 and 221 as a new approach to induce apoptosis and control angiogenesis in breast cancer. © Copyright: 2015 Srinivas et al.

abstract={In the field of image processing, contrast enhancement is a vital area to enhance contrast of images which are having poor contrast. Histogram Equalization (HE) is the method used to increase contrast in images. To improve contrast in images several HE methods persist. By determining the Probability Density Function (PDF) and Cumulative Density Function (CDF), HE expands the distribution of pixels. The overall brightness would be altered while the histogram equalization is being applied is a one kind of disadvantage. The drawback which is mentioned here can be avoided by, classifying the image based on intensity exposure and is divided into sub images based on the median value. To minimize the over enhancement, the sub images are clipped using the threshold value. Equalization can be done separately for each sub images, and the equalized sub images are combined to form a single image. Thus, to keep the brightness and to bring limitation in enhancement rate the classification and subdivision based HE method was proposed which equalizes the image. For color images, this method of equalization performs better than gray scale images. The simulation results for several test images are obtained using Matlab software tool. The results show that the entropy of the proposed method is compared with the standard HE method and it determines the amount of information available in the image. The proposed method provides better enhancement than other methods of equalization by controlling the enhancement rate. Improvements can be done by selecting the threshold values for clipping and intensity exposure. Contrast enhancement is applied in the areas of photography, medical imaging and video surveillance systems to enhance quality in images and the image looks natural.},

Vessel segmentation, region of interest (ROI) detection, image normalization, classification of vessels, artery-vein ratio (AVR) calculation are few significant measures that resulted in promising outcomes which presents a preliminary step for the detection of hypertensive retinopathy (HR). All of these methods require the automation process to display the status of the person. This paper presents the approach how the required functionalities are integrated through a Graphical User Interface (GUI) which assists the medical professional to perform further treatment according to medical protocols. Performance analysis of the proposed system is done with the help of Inspire-AVR, VICAVR database. Ground truth values and practical values obtained by using the method are used for evaluating the performance of the algorithm. Sensitivity of 0.8571 is obtained in case of INSPIRE-AVR Database, 0.8 is obtained in VICAVR database. The Promising result obtained using the method, indicates its usefulness in mass screening operation.

abstract={Zinc oxide (ZnO) thin films were deposited on glass substrates using spray pyrolysis technique at various substrate temperatures such as 523 K, 623 K and 723 K. Zinc nitrate hexahydrate was used as precursor salt. Structural studies revealed that all the films were preferably oriented towards (0 0 2) crystal plane. Depending on the substrate temperature, the intensity of the (0 0 2) plane was found to be varied. Uniformly distributed spherical nano-grains were formed in all the deposited films and their size was increased with respect to increased substrate temperature. Optical band gap was found to be 3.15, 3.12 and 3.19 eV for films deposited at 523 K, 623 K and 723 K respectively. Thickness of the films was modulated by varying the substrate temperature. The influence of film thickness on the room temperature sensing characteristics of ZnO thin films was investigated. The film with lower thickness showed better response towards acetaldehyde vapour and the lowest detection limit (LDL) was found to be 5 ppm. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved Printed in the United States of America.},

abstract={Spectrum sensing is the major tasks of cognitive radio for utilizing spectrum resources efficiently thereby identifying and making use of spectrum holes is the objective of sensing. Energy detection technique is adopted to compare the performance of different modulated signals in poor and good SNR. Probability of detection and false alarm are the metrics used to identify the number of primary users over a bandwidth of 5MHz. False alarm is kept constant to increase the detection probability. Simulink model for detections based on FFT and Welch periodogram are implemented. Modulated signals having high data rates can occupy more number of users thereby increasing the usage of spectrum. Also increase in noise should not affect the detection of primary users and reduce the probability of misdetection. Receiver operating characteristic curve is used to analyze the detections with respect to false alarm probability for different ranges of SNR. Noise uncertainty and SNR wall which can limit the performances are also taken into consideration. A unique approach to energy detection based on FFT shows increase in the sensing in the form of spectrum estimation with four primary users and the noise is assumed to be additive white Gaussian. Neyman Pearson hypothesis is considered for determining the presence and absence of users. Noise is the factor which decreases the performance of energy detector in case of blind sensing which can be limited with the help of highly modulated signals. The growing demand for spectrum makes cognitive radio an important technology to be focused in which the sensing process can reduce the interference caused to the primary users.},

abstract={Image enhancement is one of the major research areas in the field of digital image processing. The sole objective of this domain is to enhance the quality of a poor contrast image. As a result, the final processed image becomes much more understandable than the original one. A new edge based histogram equalization method is proposed in this study. A high pass filter is used to detect edges with a help of an appropriate gradient operator. In general, a convolution mask is used for this kind of area processes like filtering. This proposed method increases the quality of the poor contrast area. This method does not create an impact on brighter area in the given input image. A few portion of the poor contrast is raised and few others contrast are being reduced. The simulation results of this study are compared with the conventional histogram equalization. Our experimental results show that the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) is better than the regular Histogram Equalization (HE) method. All simulation results are obtained using Matlab simulation software tool with standard color test images. Color image enhancement methods are applicable in the areas such as iris recognition, digital photography, remote sensing, biology, medicine, geophysics and microarray techniques, etc.},

abstract={Panchadeepakini choornam is a herbal drug prepared from five different spices (ginger, black pepper, long pepper, cardamom and cumin) and used in Siddha system of medicine to cure various gastro-intestinal problems. Even though this drug has been used based on traditional knowledge, no scientific work has been done to evaluate its physico-chemical properties and antioxidant power. Hence, in the present study, we have analyzed the physico-chemical, antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of panchadeepakini choornam using in vitro methods. The choornam revealed high water soluble extractive value (51.19%), bulk and tap densities of 2.49 g, total ash and insoluble ash contents of 5.24 and 0.14 %, pH value of 7.04, loss on drying value of 5.63% and particle size of 600, 425, 300 and 75 microns. Three different solvent system such as water, ethanol and methanol were employed for preparing the extract and analyzed for antioxidant capacity. The results revealed that the water extract has higher level of total phenolic concentration and maximum level of antioxidant power in terms of phosphomolybdate reducing power, ferric reducing power, radical scavenging activity against DPPH, superoxide, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals. Hence, the results gives scientific evidence for the use of this drug in water medium, which is rich in total phenolic content and high antioxidant power in Siddha system of medicine for various gastro-intestinal problems. © 2015, Global Research Online.

The vertical ionization potential (VIP) values for the anionic clusters increase monotonically with the cluster size. Among the neutral clusters YO3 and YO8 have the least chemical hardness values, where in anionic clusters with size n<4 possesses the least chemical hardness. Anionic clusters have more electrons attracting tendency than the neutral clusters. The computed static mean polarizability of neutral yttrium oxides has positive values but is close to zero. The incorporation of oxygen atom quenches the polarizability of yttrium. The computed polarizability anisotropy of neutral clusters shows an oscillatory effect both at static and at dynamic conditions. The first hyperpolarizability for many YOn clusters are close to zero. The existence of high symmetry in these clusters reduces the first hyperpolarizability values which was supported by the small dipole moments. The computed γ values for the static neutral and anionic clusters show only a small variation. The decrease in the polarizability and second hyperpolarizability with size can be interpreted in terms of the electronic delocalization and chemical bonding in the clusters. © 2015 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

Sodium thiosulfate (STS) due to its multiple properties such as antioxidant and calcium chelation has been reported to prevent vascular calcification in uremic rats, without mentioning its impact on cerebral function. Moreover, the previous studies have not explored the effect of STS on the mitochondrial dysfunction, one of the main pathophysiological features associated with the disease and the main site for STS metabolism. The present study addresses this limitation by using a rat model where 0.75% adenine was administered to induce vascular calcification and 400 mg/kg b wt. of STS was given as preventive and curative agent. The blood and urine chemistries along with histopathology of aorta confirms the renal protective effect of STS in two modes of administration. The brain oxidative stress assessment was made through TBARS level, catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities, found to be in the near normal level. STS administration not only reduced the mitochondrial oxidative stress (measured by TBARS, SOD, GPx and CAT) but also preserved the mitochondrial respiratory enzyme activities (NADH dehydrogenase, Succinate dehydrogenase and Malate dehydrogenase) and its physiology (measured by P/O ratio and RCR). In fact, the protective effect of STS was prominent, when it was administered as a curative agent, where low H2S and high thiosulfate level was observed along with low cystathionine β synthase activity, confirms thiosulfate mediated renal protection. In conclusion, STS when given after induction of calcification is protective to the brain by preserving its mitochondria, compared to the treatment given concomitantly. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Recently, several biometric and tele-care based user authentication schemes have been proposed to enhance the safe and security of the systems. In 2013, the authors, namely Das et al. improved the authentication scheme of Chang et al. to overcome the severe security flaws, such as failed to protect man-in-the-middle attack, failed to provide the reliable authentication and flaws in client login-phase. Besides, the authors evaluated the authentication in the simulation tool of AVISPA. In the same year, the authors, namely Khurram et al. proposed an improved the authentication scheme of Youngwa An to eradicate the security flaws, like impersonation attack, mutual authentication and user anonymity. The authors, like Das et al. and Khurram et al. have had their own strategies to mitigate the security flaws, though they are still not able to evaluate their schemes in the real time medical information systems. Besides, both authors fail to prove the privacy preservation to the user systems. Thus, this paper proposes a dynamic-identity based multimedia server client authentication scheme to resolve the major security threats of Das et al. and Khurran et al. We prove that our proposed scheme is secure and efficient in comparison with the authentication schemes, namely Youngwa An, Khurram et al., Das et al. and Chang et al. We also depict that our proposed scheme can offer the features like privacy preservation and service scalability reliably for the user systems. Eventually, we design an develop a real time testbed of multimedia medical information system to cross-examine the authentication schemes. In the cross-examination, our authentication scheme shows the most achievable results for the metrics like call setup time, signal congestion and bandwidth consumption in relation to the other authentication schemes, such as Youngwa An, Khurram et al., Das et al. and Chang et al. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Biodiesel is a clean renewable fuel derived from vegetable oils and animal fats. It is biodegradable, oxygenated, non toxic and free from sulfur and aromatics. The biodiesel prepared from pinnai oil undergoes acid esterification followed by alkaline transesterification process. The fatty acid methyl esters components were identified using gas chromatography and compared with the standard properties. The properties of biodiesel are comparable with diesel. The yield of the biodiesel production depends upon the process parameters such as reaction temperature, pH, time duration and amount of catalyst. The yield of biodiesel by transesterification process was 73% at 55 °C. This fuel was tested in a variable compression ratio engine with blend ratios of B10 and B20. During the test runs the compression ratio of the engine was varied from 15:1 to 18:1 and the torque is adjusted from zero to maximum value of 22 Nm. The performance characteristics such as the brake thermal efficiency, brake specific energy consumption and exhaust gas temperature of the engine are analyzed. The combustion characteristics of biodiesel like ignition delay, combustion duration and maximum gas temperature and the emission characteristics are also analyzed. The performance characteristics, combustion characteristics and engine emission are effective in the variable compression ratio engine with biodiesel and it is compared with diesel. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive form of cancer with poor survival rates. The increased mortality due to pancreatic cancer arises due to many factors such as development of multidrug resistance, presence of cancer stem cells, development of a stromal barrier and a hypoxic environment due to hypo-perfusion. The present study aims to develop a nanocarrier for a combination of drugs that can address these multiple issues. Quercetin and 5-fluorouracil were loaded in chitosan nanoparticles, individually as well as in combination. The nanoparticles were characterized for morphology, size, zeta potential, percentage encapsulation of drugs as well as their release profiles in different media. The dual drug-loaded carrier exhibited good entrapment efficiency (quercetin 95% and 5-fluorouracil 75%) with chitosan: quercetin: 5-fluorouracil in the ratio 3:1:2. The release profiles suggest that 5-fluorouracil preferentially localized in the periphery while quercetin was located towards the core of chitosan nanoparticles. Both drugs exhibited considerable association with the chitosan matrix. The dual drug-loaded carrier system exhibited significant toxicity towards pancreatic cancer cells both in the 2D as well as in the 3D cultures. We believe that the results from these studies can open up interesting options in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

Amorphous DLC films doped with different concentrations of Chromium (Cr) (5, 10, 15 &amp; 20 at%) were deposited on to stainless steel (AISI SS304) substrate using Nd-YAG pulsed laser deposition technique (PLD). Raman spectroscopy was used to calculate the internal stress of the films. DLC with lower Cr concentration (5 at%) showed significant internal stress reduction (3 GPa) compared to DLC with higher Cr concentration. Formation of Cr3C2 nanoclusters in the DLC matrix was confirmed by XPS and TEM analysis which enhanced the adhesion strength of the film. DLC films with lower Cr concentration exhibited ultra-low friction coefficient (0.04-0.09) and the value increased significantly in higher Cr concentration. An optimum metal concentration in DLC film leads to improved adhesion and friction behaviour that houses many engineering applications. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Nonlinear localized magnetic excitations in 1-D bicomponent magnonic crystal are investigated under periodic magnetic field of spatially varying strength with spin current. The governing modified Landau-Lifshitz equation with spin current is transformed into the variable coefficient nonlinear Schrödinger (VCNLS) equation using a stereographic projection. In general, the VCNLS equation is nonintegrable and by using similarity transformation technique, the VCNLS equation is reduced into the standard NLS equation with certain integrability conditions. A systematic connection between the solution of VCNLS and NLS equations is established. The solution of VCNLS equation is obtained using the solution of the NLS equation. The excitation of magnetization is in the form of solitons on the oscillatory background with structure similar to the form of spin Bloch waves, and in addition, the spin current controls the soliton velocity. The velocity of soliton is directly proportional to the strength of current density and inversely proportional to the average saturation magnetization value, which is the value of saturation magnetization of the composite material at the interface of the two ferromagnetic materials, which are used to form the bicomponent magnonic crystal. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disorder involving genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors and has higher incidence in women. In this study, we explored the association of estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) rs2234693 (PvuII) and rs9340799 (XbaI) polymorphisms with susceptibility to SLE. PCR-RFLP and ELISA were used for genetic analysis and determination of specific autoantibodies, respectively. The univariate analysis showed no independent association of rs2234693 (OR: 1.14, 95% CI: 0.87 - 1.49, p = 0.36) and rs9340799 (OR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.66-1.14, p = 0.34). The haplotype analysis using SHEsis platform revealed strong linkage disequilibrium between these two polymorphisms (D': 0.81, r2: 0.55). Among the four haplotype groups, the C-A haplotype (rs2234693-rs9340799) was strongly associated with the risk for SLE (OR: 2.10, 95% CI: 1.32 - 3.34, p = 0.001). The homozygous variant genotype of rs2234693 exhibited elevated TNF-α and depleted IFN-α, while the effects of rs9340799 were contradictory. The wild genotype of rs2234693 exhibited lower levels of IL-12 with number of rs9340799 variant alleles pronouncing this effect. From this study, it is concluded that the ESR1 haplotypes may influence the Th2 cytokine profile and susceptibility to SLE among the South Indians. © 2015, National Institute of Science Communication.

abstract={In this article, we have investigated the down-conversion luminescence properties of Ca0.5La(MoO4)2 doped with trivalent Pr3+ (substitute for La3+ site) and codoped with Mn2+ (substitute for Ca2+ site). The powder X-ray diffraction patterns confirm that the single crystalline phosphor powders belong to the scheelite-type tetragonal crystal structure. The photoluminescence (PL) excitation spectra of Ca0.5La(MoO4)2:Pr3+ exhibits a charge transfer band centered at 276 nm along with three intense sharp absorption bands identified at 449, 475, and 488 nm which are attributed to the f–f electronic transitions of 3H4 (1) → 3P2, 3H4 (1) → 3P1, 3H4 (1) → 3P0 of Pr3+, respectively. Upon optical excitation, the depopulation of excited 3P0 level into the 3F2 lower levels of Pr3+ is governed by radiative transfer of energy, as a result, high intense red emission peak was observed at 647 nm. The change in PL emission intensity as a function of Pr3+ concentrations, Mn2+ concentrations, and different excitation wavelengths have been investigated in detail. Further, the codoping of alkali metal chlorides MCl (M = Na, K, Li) into the Ca0.5La(MoO4)2:Pr3+ phosphor greatly improves the luminescence intensity of the transition 3P0 → 3F2 which can be explained by charge compensation effect. To ensure the colour richness and quality of its emission, the photometric parameters were estimated using spectral energy distribution functions of Ca0.5La(MoO4)2:Pr3+. The luminous efficacy of radiation for NaCl codoped Ca0.5La(MoO4)2:Pr3+ phosphor was estimated to be 154 lm/W and the percentage of luminous efficiency is 23 %. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Sputtering power variation plays a vital role in controlling the properties of titanium dioxide (TiO2) films, which in turn have influence on ammonia (NH3) sensing properties. In the present work, TiO2 films were deposited on glass substrates using reactive dc magnetron sputtering at different sputtering powers (100, 150 and 200 W). X-ray diffraction patterns revealed the formation of single phase (anatase) at lower power and mixed phase (anatase and rutile) at higher power. NH3 sensing response was found to be high for the anatase TiO2 film deposited at 150 W. The response values were found to be 1.9–772 for 10–100 ppm of NH3 at room temperature with fast response time (12 s) and recovery time (63 s). The obtained results highlighted the better sensing performance of anatase-TiO2 films towards NH3, due to oxygen vacancies and greater catalytic activity than the mixed phase films. The NH3 adsorption on the TiO2 films followed Elovich equation and the response kinetics were of first order. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Atorvastatin is a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A reductase inhibitor used in the treatment of atherosclerosis and dyslipidemia. Studies have evaluated the utility of statins in the treatment of skin inflammation but with varied results. In the present study, we investigated the effect of atorvastatin on TNF-α release and keratinocyte proliferation in vitro and in acute and chronic 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) induced skin inflammation in vivo. Atorvastatin significantly inhibited lipopolysacharide induced TNF-α release in THP-1 cells and keratinocyte proliferation in HaCaT cells. In an acute study, topical atorvastatin showed dose dependent reduction in TPA induced skin inflammation with highest efficacy observed at 500 μg/ear dose. In chronic study, topical atorvastatin significantly reduced TPA induced ear thickness, ear weight, cutaneous cytokines, MPO activity and improved histopathological features comparable to that of dexamethasone. Atorvastatin also inhibited TPA stimulated NF-κB activation in mouse ear. In conclusion, our results suggest that atorvastatin ameliorates TPA induced skin inflammation in mice at least in part, due to inhibition of cytokine release and NF-κB activation and may be beneficial for the treatment skin inflammation like psoriasis. © 2014 The Pharmaceutical Society of Korea.},

abstract={In 3G, the server platform of IP multimedia subsystem (IMS) offers multimedia service to the multimedia clients through the exchange of authenticated key agreement (AKA) scheme. Since the IMS service is transmitted over public networks, the server and client of IMS shares a common session-key via the execution of AKA scheme to secure the communication service over a public network. Though there are some identical steps involved in the key authentication Scheme of IMS, the communication efficiencies of IMS server and client are still conciliating. Besides, it is having the issues of insecurity and session compatibility dealt with the real time transport protocol (RTP). To resolve the issues of IMS, this paper proposes three novel schemes: (1) The first scheme is multimedia server–client authentication scheme and its purpose is to mitigate the packet congestion on the networks; (2) The second scheme is traffic on background and its purpose is to analyze the signal congestion, bandwidth consumption and network utilization of the system; and (3) The last one is fault detection index and its purpose is to prevent the SIP vulnerabilities, like bye and invite. In addition, we integrate the proposed and existing authentication schemes, such as EPS-AKA, AP-AKA, UMTS-AKA, X-AKA, S-AKA and so on., in the IMS server and client environments to testify the metrics, namely round trip time, call response time, packet generation, flow analysis, RTP session, network utilization, throughput analysis, bandwidth utilization and flooding attack detection realistically. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={A common external forcing can cause a saddle-node bifurcation in an ensemble of identical Duffing oscillators by breaking the symmetry of the individual bistable (double-well) unit. The strength of the forcing determines the separation between the saddle and the node, which in turn dictates different dynamical transitions depending on the distribution of the initial states of the oscillators. In particular, chimera-like states appear in the vicinity of the saddle-node bifurcation for which theoretical explanation is provided from the stability of the steady state of the slow-scale dynamics of the original system of equations. Further, we have also established similar states by replacing the external forcing with an appropriate coupling between the oscillators in the same parameter space. Additionally, we have also designed an appropriate coupling that can lead to saddle-node bifurcation due to symmetry breaking of the bistable systems in the vicinity of which the synchronized and desynchronized domains coexist. ï¿½ EPLA, 2015.},

abstract={Cancer is considered a complicated health issue worldwide. The mean cancer survival through standard therapeutic strategies has not been significantly improved over the past few decades. Hence, alternate remedies are needed to treat or prevent this dreadful disease being explored. Currently, it has been recognized that repeated treatment with chemotherapeutic agents has been largely ineffective due to multidrug resistance and further conventional treatment possesses limited drug accessibility to cancerous tissues, which in turn necessitates a higher dose resulting in increased cytotoxicity. Drug combinations have been practiced to address the problems associated with conventional single drug treatment. Recently, natural dietary agents have attracted much attention in cancer therapy because of their synergistic effects with anticancer drugs against different types of cancer. Natural phytochemicals may execute their anticancer activity through targeting diverse cancer cell signaling pathways, promoting cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, regulating antioxidant status and detoxification. This review focuses mainly on the anticancer efficacy of dietary phytochemicals in combination with standard therapeutic drugs reported from various in vitro and in vivo experimental studies apart from clinical trials. This review adds knowledge to the field of intervention studies using combinational modalities that opens a new window for cancer treatment/chemoprevention.

abstract={Optimization techniques are generally used to study and evaluate the performance of the processes or operations under which the work or the product is made. An attempt is initiated in this paper, to optimize the densification and deformation characteristics of the sintered plain carbon steel (Fe-0.5%C) processed through the powder metallurgy using Taguchi-grey relational analysis. Atomized iron powders (Fe) of size 100 μm and graphite (C) were accurately weighed on the basis of weight and homogeneously blended in an indigenously fabricated pot mill. Compacts of various aspect ratios (ARs), viz., 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 1.1, and 1.3, were made using a suitable cylindrical die and punch set up on a 1000 kN computer interfaced universal testing machine. The green compacts were then sintered in a nitrogen purged muffle furnace. The sintered preforms of various ARs of the plain carbon steel were subjected to cold upset forging to study their deformation and densification properties. Taguchi-grey optimization technique was then applied to optimize the parameters such as AR and load for maximum deformation and density. The preforms of higher AR are found to be the better for higher axial, lateral deformations, and relative density at lesser load or stress value. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Until now, most of the studies reported in the field of inhibition assay focused on the use of high and low substrate concentrations for the detection of inhibitors in real samples. However, optimizing the ratio of inhibitor to substrate concentration in order to highlight the inhibition of enzyme activity has not been reported. Hence a modified model based on the percentage inhibition has been framed by considering enzyme inhibition at various substrate concentrations. In this work measurement of an enzyme inhibition reaction for varying substrate concentrations in the presence of an inhibitor was utilized to illustrate the utility of the proposed model in the field of inhibition assay. The proposed model is novel because it requires no special parameters such as pH, temperature and incubation time. Using this bio-analytical approach, the accurate quantification of inhibitors in real time samples can be determined. Copyright © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.},

abstract={Edible oil is the source of energy that is consumed on large quantities across the world. Sunflower oil consumption has increased as it contains linoleic acid that washes the cholesterol from arteries, also lowers low density level cholesterol. Hazardous Heavy metals even in trace levels are toxic to human beings as they cause various disorders. Mercury and cadmium in edible sunflower oil were determined using Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy. The levels of Hg and Cd in sunflower oil were above the acceptable limit, hence to identify source of the heavy metals was carried out in soil, water and in sunflower seeds from the regions where they are cultivated. The statistical descriptive measures and correlation were determined. The presence of heavy metals could be due adulteration with palm oil or other source. © 2015 RASĀYAN. All rights reserved.},

abstract={An attempt has been made to understand the impact of thermal aging with copper sulphide diffused oil impregnated pressboard (OIP) material for surface discharge inception voltage (SDIV) variation. The SDIV of Copper sulphide diffused OIP material reduces with increase in thermal aging. The UHF signals generated due to surface discharges with copper sulphide diffused OIP at the point of inception have frequency content in the range 0.7-1.5 GHz with its dominant frequency at 0.9GHz. HFCT measurement indicated that the rise time of injected current pulse due to surface discharge activity in the negative and positive half cycle of the AC voltage are about 0.8ns and 1ns respectively. It is also found that increase in thermal aging of copper sulphide diffused OIP, the amplitude and width of the current pulse increases. The magnitude of surface charge and its mean life is high with thermal aging temperature of copper sulphide diffused OIP material. Polarity of surface charge acquired by OIP due to AC corona charging depends on the surface condition of the pressboard material and its charge decay rate is lower than under DC voltage. Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) and Energy Dispersive Spectrometry (EDS) study confirms the presence of copper sulphide on the surface of OIP and is found to be increased for copper sulfide diffused OIP material compare to unused OIP material. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) analysis indicates formation of cracks with thermally aged OIP material. Phase Resolved Partial Discharge (PRPD) study indicates that the surface discharge activity occurs near the peaks of the applied AC voltage at inception and at the rising portion of the applied AC voltage at higher voltages. It is found that the tensile and flexural strength reduces drastically for thermally aged copper sulphide diffused OIP material compare to unused specimen. © 1994-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={In a manufacturing industry, mixed model assembly line (MMAL) is preferred in order to meet the variety in product demand. MMAL balancing helps in assembling products with similar characteristics in a random fashion. The objective of this work aims in reducing the number of workstations, work load index between stations and within each station. As manual contribution of workers in final assembly line is more, ergonomics is taken as an additional objective function. Ergonomic risk level of a workstation is evaluated using a parameter called accumulated risk posture (ARP), which is calculated using rapid upper limb assessment (RULA) check sheet. This work is based on the case study of an MMAL problem in Rane (Madras) Ltd. (India), in which a problem based genetic algorithm (GA) has been proposed to minimize the mentioned objectives. The working of the genetic operators such as selection, crossover and mutation has been modified with respect to the addressed MMAL problem. The results show that there is a significant impact over productivity and the process time of the final assembled product, i.e., the rate of production is increased by 39.5% and the assembly time for one particular model is reduced to 13 min from existing 18 min. Also, the space required using the proposed assembly line is only 200 m2 against existing 350 m2. Further, the algorithm helps in reducing workers fatigue (i.e., ergonomic friendly). © 2015, Central South University Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Studies relating to the adjuvanic role of self assembly, nanosized betulinic acid (SA-BA) are relatively limited. The concept of immunostimulatory activity of SA-BA is based on the activation of immune system against cancer antigen. This study showed that SA-BA, a pentacyclic triterpene isolated from the bark of the Ziziphus jujube tree, elevated the immunological functions of cancer antigen in anticancer immunotherapy. We found that, SA-BA pulsed human macrophages secreted elevated level of pro-inflammatory cytokines with an increased CD4+ cell population. Pulse macrophages were also significantly arrested the KG-1A and K562 cell growth in vitro setup at 1:10 ratio for 48h. The use of TNF-α inhibitors confirmed the association between SA-BA with TNF-α function. SA-BA pulsed macrophages displayed substantial T cell allostimulatory capacity and promoted the generation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). The adjuvanticity of SA-BA was proved by the generation of in vivo IgG response. Collectively, these findings will enrich the biomedical applications of SA-BA as a potent immune stimulating agent. Moreover, the macrophage stimulating efficacy of SA-BA might be an effective way in the cancer immunotherapy. © 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

abstract={Two phase flow regime identification and void fraction measurement is an area of considerable interest because of its wide applications in process industries. The principle involved in dielectric measurement is that the two phase flow regime is characterized by the changes in effective permittivity of the two phase fluid mixture. In the present work, a pair of parallel copper electrodes on the two sides of a glass tube acts as a dielectric sensor. As the void fraction in the glass tube changes, the effective permittivity of the medium changes. This causes a variation in the capacitance value across the electrodes. A standard IC, Oscillator 555 is employed as a tool to generate a rectangular wave. The variation in dielectric constant is analyzed based on the change in time period of the trough (T<inf>0</inf>) of the rectangular wave that is recorded online by a data acquisition system. Experiments were performed in a 4.7mm diameter tube with air-water, air-palmolein oil two phase fluids to study the variation in dielectric constant which is indicated as a change in time period of trough. The effect of conductivity of water on the capacitance variation is examined with water having Total dissolved solids (TDS) which is a measure of movable ions in the range 10-4000ppm (16μS/cm-6.3mS/cm). The novelty in the present work is the determination of changes in capacitance value based on the change in time of trough of the rectangular wave. The technique does not require amplification or a filtering circuit, thereby leading to a precise identification of two phase flow regime. © 2015.},

abstract={In a previous study we reported the role of potent bisindole-PBD conjugate as an inclusion in the arsenal of breast cancer therapeutics. In breast cancer cell proliferation, PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway plays a crucial role by prosurvival mechanism that inhibits programmed cell death. Here, 2 breast cancer cells lines, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 were treated with Vorinostat (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid / SAHA) and bisindole-PBD (5b). We have investigated the effect on PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and SIRT expression including epigenetic regulation. There was consistent decrease in the level of PI3K, AKT, mTOR proteins upon treatment of 5b in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines compared to untreated controls. Treatment with caspase inhibitor (Q-VD-OPH) confirmed that the effect of 5b on PI3K signaling was ahead of apoptosis. Real time PCR and western blot analysis showed profound reduction in the mRNA and protein levels of SIRT1 and SIRT2. Molecular docking studies also supported the interaction of 5b with various amino acids of SIRT2 proteins. Treatment with 5b caused epigenetic changes that include increase of acetylated forms of p53, increase of histone acetylation at p21 promoter as well as decrease in methylation state of p21 gene. Compound 5b thus acts as SIRT inhibitor and cause p53 activation via inhibition of growth factor signaling and activation of p53 dependent apoptotic signaling. This present study focuses bisindole-PBD on epigenetic alteration putting 5b as a promising therapeutic tool in the realm of breast cancer research. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Experiments were performed to establish a feasible treatment process for the solidification and stabilization (S/S) of soil contaminated by leaching of Cr(VI) from Chromite ore processing residue (COPR). Reduction of the highly mobile Cr(VI) was performed using calcium polysulfide (CaS<inf>5</inf>) with a dosage of 3 times the molar stoichiometric ratio for the initial concentration of Cr(VI) present in the chromium contaminated soil (CCS). The CCS was solidified and stabilized (S/S) using fly ash (FA) in various proportions i.e., 1:1, 1:2, 1:3 (FA: CCS) with and without using reducing agent i.e., CaS<inf>5</inf>. Leachability tests such as Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) and semi-dynamic long term leachability tests indicated that the CaS<inf>5</inf> was effective in reduction of Cr(VI) followed by the S/S process. Leachability Index was derived from the results of the semi-dynamic long term leachability tests and was between 8 and 9, indicating that FA is an effective treatment for disposal into secured landfills for CCS. The characteristic compressive strength of the CaS<inf>5</inf> treated CCS with FA mortar blocks were between 24.47 and 40.49 kg/cm2. Considering the cost of CaS<inf>5</inf> and FA, a total expenditure of Rs. 7826 i.e., US $ 130.4 would be required for remediation of one tonne of CCS. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In Recent days, Information Technology walks into all spheres of life. The need for processing the information and analysing the processed information is one of the challenging task in any domain. Naive Bayes is one of the most elegant and simple classifier in data mining field. Irrespective of its feature independence assumptions, it surpasses all other classification techniques by yielding very good performance. In this paper, we attempted to increase the prediction accuracy of Naive Bayes model by integrating it with K nearest neighbours (KNN) and Random forest (RF). We believe that the simplicity of this approach and its great performance will be helpful for any classification. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={When a patient comes to hospital and able to walk then he could be conscious, walking but he need help from hospital staff if he is not feeling well. The time he comes for consolation to doctor, it may be late and he may be more critical. Lets call this situation ‘pre-consultation urgent help needed.’ Many times it happened that when person coming to hospital is not well and needs urgent attention, he is pointed to reception counter to queue in for consultation. So, some mechanism is needed to detect that person coming to hospital needs urgent help or not. Gait is considered best for this situation where person might not be able to come to machine to give biometric information. This paper discusses gait recognition and its suitability in the case of ‘pre-consultation urgent help needed’ and implements this functionality. Also with the gait, it could be detected whether a person has homeostasis or not. Feature extraction was performed on each image frame of live video, and SVM was used to classify the gait detected from the person’s live image frame. The system uses MS Kinect as hardware and is very cost-effective. Experimental results show 96 % recognition accuracy. © 2014, Springer-Verlag London.},

Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) is one of the estimation technique used for estimating the non-linear system, will estimate the future state of the system and determines the error involved in the system. Also this paper justifies that UKF is worthwhile than the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). Due to various drawbacks that have been noted in the EKF, thus there is a switch over to the UKF which does not linearize the non-linear function and it is free from calculating the Jacobianmatix, taylor series expansion. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Environmental pollution is a major concern for textile industries. The generation of voluminous amounts of effluent and their disposal into the water bodies without proper treatment has lead to detrimental effects on environment. The textile effluent is characterized by high chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD), total dissolved solids (TDS), pH, and color. Fabric preparation steps like, desizing, scouring, bleaching, mercerizing, involve the use of various chemicals and plenty of water. Desizing process alone has been reported to account for about 50 % volume of effluent generated in textile industries. On the other hand, dyeing operation makes use of huge amount of dyes. During dyeing, in order to increase the amount of dye fixed to the cloth, auxiliary chemicals including sodium chloride and sodium carbonate are added in conventional process. In spite of this, large amount of dyes remain unconsumed in the process and find their way to the effluent along with the electrolytes added and pose serious threat to the environment by making the receiving water reservoirs unsuitable for agriculture and human consumption. The available end-of-pipe treatment procedures are either expensive or less efficient. Hence a large number of small-scale industries succumb to this problem. So finding an alternative eco-friendly process of textile production is of paramount interest. Here we review three potential eco-friendly systems in textile dyeing processes to minimize salt and water consumption. First, we review application of enzymatic processing in fabric preparation. Some of the enzymes involved in desizing, scouring and bleaching operations are amylases, pectinases, glucose oxidases, catalases, etc. Enzymes can eliminate use of strong alkali and subsequent water washes. It has been reported that 10 kg of enzyme can save up to 20,000 kg of water consumption per ton of yarn processed. Secondly, we review the use of bio-degradable organic salts like trisodium citrate, magnesium acetate, tetrasodium edate, sodium salts of polycarboxylic acids etc., as fixation and exhaustion agents. It is reported that total dissolved solids content in the spent liquor released from trisodium citrate dyeing process is about 40-65 % less than that of conventional sodium chloride dyeing. Finally, we review surface modifications of cotton to reduce the volume of effluent and total dissolved solids. Cationization of fibre surface results in salt-free dyeing process. Various monomers, polymers, dendrimers, chitosan etc. are used for cationization. The effects of other surface modification techniques like plasma treatment, corona discharge are also reviewed. It has been reported that plasma treatment of cotton fiber increases percentage exhaustion and K/S by about 10 % and 14 % respectively in reactive dyeing. These aspects can contribute to a more eco-friendly textile processing. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The extraordinary ligand binding properties of albumin makes it a key player in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of many vital drugs. Albumin is highly susceptible for nonenzymatic glycation mediated structural modifications, and there is a need to determine structural and functional impact of specific AGEs modifications. The present study was aimed toward determining the AGE mediated structure and function changes, primarily looking into the effect on binding affinity of drugs in the two major drug binding sites of albumin. The impact of the two most predominant AGEs modifications, i.e., carboxyethyllysine (CEL) and argpyrimidine (Arg-P), was studied on the basis of the combination of in vitro and in silico experiments. In vitro studies were carried out by AGEs modification of bovine serum albumin (BSA) for the formation of Arg-P and CEL followed by drug interaction studies. In silico studies involved molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and docking studies for native and AGEs modified BSAs. In particular the side chain modification was specifically carried out for the residues in the drug binding sites, i.e., Arg-194, Arg-196, Arg-198, and Arg-217, and Lys-204 (site I) and Arg-409 and Lys-413 (site II). The equilibrated structures of native BSA (n-BSA) and glycated BSA (G-BSA) as obtained from MD were used for drug binding studies using molecular docking approach. It was evident from the results of both in vitro and in silico drug interaction studies that AGEs modification results in the reduced drug binding affinity for tolbutamide (TLB) and ibuprofen (IBP) in sites I and II. Moreover, the AGEs modification mediated conformational changes resulted in the shallow binding pockets with reduced accessibility for drugs. © 2015 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Evaluation of land cover/use change and its impact on hydrological design aspects plays a vital role in assessing the capacity of existing storm water conveyance systems and its capability towards the anticipated peak flow. This paper attempts to illustrate an application of Soil Conservation Service (SCS-CN) method for runoff estimation using continuous time series rainfall. And also, the present work proposes a Land use factor based on the Curve Number to correct the infiltration rate according to the prevailing land cover/use. Indian remote sensing (IRS) satellite data for the years 1989, 1992, 1995, 1998, 2001, 2004, 2007, and 2010 are used to evaluate the growth of Tiruchirapalli city, India city and to assess its impact on surface runoff. The Geographical information system (GIS) is used to prepare the different layers belonging to various land covers identified from remotely sensed data. The sub-watersheds are created using Digital Elevation Model (DEM) prepared by ARC GIS software. The single storm event and 50-year return period rainfall data are used as a hydrological input to the model to evaluate the increase in runoff over the years due to change in the land cover of the study area. The study reveals that the impact of land cover/use change is more significant for longer duration storm than short duration storm at the same magnitude. Further, it is noticed from the study that the runoff depth and runoff co-efficient is large for short duration rainfall than long duration rainfall at the same magnitude. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

A comparative study on the performance of the low pass filters and the median filters for removing this kind of impulse noise from the images corrupted up to 90% of noise density is performed. In addition to the impulse noise models implemented in the Boundary Discriminative noise detection (BDND) algorithm, two new noise models are proposed in consideration to handle a high noise environment. The performance metrics like Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Image Enhancement Factor (IEF) are analyzed and compared for the proposed novel noise models using Matlab simulation software tool. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Wind tunnels are used in aerodynamic and heat transfer research to analyze various effects on solid objects when air is forced on to them. This is done using a powerful fan or by a blower. These wind tunnels are equipped with suitable sensors for sensing various parameters like pressure variation, calculating the aerodynamic forces and other fluid flow characteristics. In present work, velocity of air in wind tunnel is controlled by adjusting the fan speed. The fan speed is controlled by varying the voltage supplied to the motor using DAC0808. DAC0808 converts the digital value to analog voltage. The digital value is obtained by considering the set point given (required RPM) by the user through LabVIEW graphical interface.

abstract={In this study, wavelet based image resolution enhancement is proposed using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Stationary Wavelet Transform (SWT) through Fusion technique. By applying DWT, the image is divided into various subbands of frequency level. Interpolation techniques are employed to increase the size of image. By Fusing the SWT subbands with the high frequency components of DWT to get high frequency interpolated subband images, whereas low frequency is obtained from the original image which is interpolated to get low frequency components. Biorthogonal wavelets are used in the fusion process. Then the image is reconstructed using Inverse Discrete Wavelet Transform (IDWT). Histogram equalization is performed in order to increase the image brightness and then high resolution subbands are again with downsampled image using db 9/7 wavelet to get high resoluted image. This is tested in addition with one application of visible watermarking as a case study. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Distribution static compensator (DSTATCOM) is the optimal choice of power quality (PQ) compensator in a three-phase four-wire distribution system for the mitigation of PQ problems. The performance of the PQ compensator under varying load and nonideal source conditions relies on the control strategy. A neural network-based p-q control algorithm is proposed in this paper for the DSTATCOM, which comprises of a four-leg voltage-source converter with a dc capacitor. The proposed control strategy implements five artificial neural network controllers for, the conversion of nonideal voltage source into ideal sinusoidal voltage, the extraction of dc component $\overline p $ of load real power supplied to the load, maintenance of the voltage across the capacitor, and mitigation of neutral current. The performance of the proposed neural network-based p-q control strategy for DSTATCOM is evaluated under various possible source and load conditions by simulating in MATLAB/Simulink environment, and the results obtained through the simulation are validated experimentally by a prototype developed in the laboratory. Both the experimental and simulation results prove that the performance of the proposed neural network-based control strategy is superior to the conventional method. © 2003-2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Naturally occurring polymers such as alginate (AL) and chitosan (CS) are widely used in biomedical and pharmaceutical fields in various forms such as nanoparticles, capsules, and emulsions. These polymers have attractive applications in drug delivery because of their biodegradability, biocompatibility, and nontoxic nature. The pharmaceutical applications of essential oils such as turmeric oil and lemongrass oil are well-known, and their active components, ar-turmerone and citral, respectively, are known for their antibacterial, antifungal, antioxidant, antimutagenic, and anticarcinogenic properties. However, these essential oils are unstable, volatile, and insoluble in water, which limits their use for new formulations. Therefore, this study focuses on developing a CS-AL nanocarrier for the encapsulation of essential oils. The effects of process parameters such as the effect of heat and the concentrations of AL and CS were investigated. Various physicochemical characterization techniques such as scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy were performed. Results of characterization studies showed that 0.3 mg/mL AL and 0.6 mg/mL CS produced minimum-sized particles (<300 nm) with good stability. It was also confirmed that the oil-loaded nanocapsules were hemocompatible, suggesting their use for future biomedical and pharmaceutical applications. Furthermore, the antiproliferative activity of turmeric oil- and lemongrass oil-loaded nanocapsules was estimated using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay in A549 cell lines and it was found that both the nanoformulations had significant antiproliferative properties than the bare oil.

Salt and pepper noise is a form of noise it present itself as sparsely occurring white and black pixels. Median filtering is very widely used in digital image processing to remove noise because, under certain conditions, it preserves edges while removing noise. In the present study window boundary index is checked by means of iterative process. The window size is reshaped to 1-D, sorted to get a median value and thus the noise is filtered. Experimental results of the improved algorithm outperforms other two Algorithms in terms of metrics like MSE, PSNR, IEF(Image Enhancement Factor), ET(Elapsed Time) and the results are shown using MATLAB simulation software tool. The dominance of algorithm in this study is justified through visual interpretation. © 2015, International Journal of Pharmacy and Technology. All rights Reserved.},

abstract={The need for audio signal processing arises from the fact that all the systems that we deal in real are not ideal, as a result the signal gets corrupted and may loss the information embedded in it. Signals have to be processed so that the information that they contain can be displayed, analyzed, or converted to another type of signal that may be of use. The complexity of analog filter implementation can now be overcome by employing digital filters. In this study, a real time implementation of FIR digital filters on Altera DE1 FPGA Kit is done using Verilog Hardware Description Language to analyze the results of audio enhancement. The audio signal is sampled using audio codec and then fed to the 2,4,8,16 and 32 tap FIR digital filters which are implemented on FPGA for audio enhancement. A noise generator is executed on FPGA to corrupt the signal and it is filtered to recover the audio signal. We simulate the code using Altera Quartus II synthesis software and the compilation reports are generated to know the FPGA resource utilization summary. © 2015, International Journal of Pharmacy and Technology.

In the present work, the heat transfer characteristics of hollow cylindrical pin fin array on a vertical rectangular base plate is studied using commercial CFD code ANSYS FLUENTⒸ. The hollow cylindrical pin fins are arranged inline. The heat transfer augmentation is studied for different parameters such as inner radius, outer radius, height of the fins and number of pin fins. The base plate is supplied with a constant heat flux in the range of 20–500 W. The base plate dimensions are kept constant. The base plate temperature is predicted using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) by training the network based on the results of numerical simulation. The trained ANN is used to analyse the fin in terms of enhanced heat transfer and weight reduction when compared to solid pin fin. Optimization of the hollow cylindrical pin fin parameters to obtain maximum heat transfer from the base plate is carried out using Genetic Algorithm (GA) applied on the trained neural network. The analysis using the numerical simulation and neural network shows that the hollow fins provide an increased heat transfer and a weight reduction of about 90% when compared to solid cylindrical pin fins. © 2015, Indian Academy of Sciences.},

abstract={Jatropha tanjorensis (Euphorbeacea) leaves are used as a food and for various herbal medicines in India and African countries. But only diminutive information is available on the secondary metabolites and their correlation with its traditional uses. Reversed-phase Liquid chromatography with C18 bonded silica gel coupled to ultraviolet (UV) detection and mass spectrometer encompass of quadrupole mass analyzer with time-of-flight mass detection (micrOTOF-QII) was standardized for the identification of semipolar compounds in the extract. Total ion chromatogram (TIC) was processed using Hystar 3.2 software tools. Compounds were assigned by comparing their mass signals with compounds already reported and MS/MS spectral MassBank libraries. With this approach several compounds not reported previously from Jatropha tanjorensis were identified. The methanolic extract from leaves of Jatropha tanjorensis (MEJT) contained a complex mixture of 20 flavonoids predominantly as glycosides, with few aglycones. Isorhamnetin-3-glucoside-4′-glucoside, delphinidin-3-O-2″-O-β-xylopyranosyl-β-glucopyranoside, 6-c-hexosyl-8-c-pentosyl apigenin, cyanidin-3,5-di-O-glucoside, 3′,7-dimethoxy-3-hydroxyflavone and 2″,3″,4′,5,6″,7-hexa-O-methylisovitexin were found in the methanolic extract of J. tanjorensis leaves. The core aglycones of these flavonoids were identified as apigenin, luteolin, isorhamnetin, quercetin and kaempferol. Few other bioactive molecules like rhein, benzamidine and derivative of ellagic acid were also identified. Apart from phenolic compounds few medicinally potent alkaloids like norharman, harmane, salsolinol and anabasine were also identified. To depict its biological activity against cancer cells, inhibition of proliferation assay (MTT) was performed on human skin carcinoma cells (A431) with an IC50 of 58.53 μg/mL. The methanolic extract from leaves of Jatropha tanjorensis has shown potent antimicrobial activity against various strains of bacteria with an MIC of 7.8 μg/mL. The methanolic extract from leaves of Jatropha tanjorensis was also evaluated for its anti-inflammatory activity through proteinase inhibition activity (IC50 166.2 μg/mL), inhibition of protein denaturation (IC50 165.4 μg/mL) and membrane stabilization (IC50 160.4 μg/mL). Antioxidant property was evaluated using reducing hydroxyl ion assay with an IC50 of 46.43 μg/mL. Results acquired prove the potent efficiency of selected plant against various disease conditions progresses to cancer. Present study also provide the necessary information on the chemical composition of Jatropha tanjorensis, thus suggesting yet another "authentication" in the identification of the selected plant.},

abstract={Low Aspect Ratio (LAR, aspect ratio < 2) wings exhibit highly nonlinear lift curves. Controlling such LAR Mini Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) at high Angle of Attacks (AOA) and in cross-wind conditions is difficult due to the nonlinear lift. Also, maneuvering these MAVs at high AOA is highly constrained by elevator throw. However, high AOA is a requisite for MAVs to enable slow flight in constrained spaces. Conventional aircraft use devices called vortex generators (or turbulators) that delay the separation of boundary layer by artificially inducing vortices. A similar phenomenon is observed in golf balls, where the surface dimples mimic the above effect. It is also observed that the local vortices aid in additional lift generation. This paper presents a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) study on the effect of dimples over the aerodynamic performance of a LAR flying wing with aspect ratio 1.45 & SELIG4083 cross section. A Modified Inverse Zimmerman planform wing has been considered similar to the MAV (Black Kite) developed by the National Aerospace Laboratories Bangalore (NAL). The 3D model was generated in SolidWorks™ and CFD analysis was performed in SolidWorksTM Flow Simulation. The baseline smooth surface wing was validated with the aerodynamic data of SELIG4083 airfoil from literature. Following it, several dimpled wing configurations on the leading edge were created and analyzed. It was observed that dimples create local vortices that aid in lift generation, increasing the effective flight envelope. The associated drag due to local vortices should be overcome by generating additional thrust at high AOA.},

abstract={B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) and BCL2-associated X protein (BAX) proteins are anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic determinants of mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis, and their relative expression determines the cell fate. The promoter polymorphisms in these genes were shown to alter the protein function or expression and exert an impact on apoptosis regulation. Deregulation in the expression of any of these genes leads to disruption of cellular homeostasis and malignant transformation. The present study was aimed to determine the association of BCL2-938C>A and BAX-248G>A promoter polymorphisms with origin and progression of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We also have performed combined genotype analysis to evaluate the cumulative effect of risk genotypes in the AML development. These polymorphisms were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction- restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) in 221 AML patients and 305 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Our study revealed that BCL2-938CA (p = 0.018) and BAX-248GG (0.043) genotypes were significantly associated with increased risk for AML occurrence. BAX-248A allele had shown decreased risk for AML. The combined analysis had shown that BCL2-938CA+AA-BAX-248GG group had a 1.63-fold (95 % CI: 1.08–2.45, p = 0.02) increased risk for AML. None of the clinical variables had shown any significant association with both polymorphisms. With respect to complete remission (CR) rate, BAX-248GG genotype (p = 0.002) and G allele (p = 0.009) had conferred significant risk for complete remission failure. Although the log rank test was not significant, survival analysis had shown a trend where BCL2-938CA genotype, and BAX-248GG had reduced median disease-free survival (DFS) of 9 and 10 months, respectively. In conclusion, BCL2-938C>A and BAX-248G>A gene polymorphisms might contribute to the origin of AML. Moreover, influence of BAX-248GG genotype on CR and DFS rate suggests that the BAX-248G>A polymorphism can serve as marker for poor prognosis in AML. © 2015, International Society of Oncology and BioMarkers (ISOBM).},

abstract={A facile, one-pot, room-temperature synthesis method for super-paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) employing simple reactants was attempted using a battery of stabilizers possessing either hydroxyl (methyl cellulose, polyethylene glycol), or a combination of hydroxyl and carboxyl functional groups (carboxymethyl cellulose sodium, trisodium citrate, α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol succinate), from carbohydrate and non-carbohydrate sources, added to the reaction mixture in situ. Finally, carboxymethyl cellulose sodium (CMC)-coated SPIONs were selected, which were further cross-linked with epichlorohydrin to improve the stability of coating and load a water-soluble model molecule, rhodamine B. The selected formulation with optimum nanometric size (24. ±. 8. nm) was characterized for morphology, surface charge, interaction of CMC with iron oxide, crystal phase, magnetization properties and finally microfluidic studies were carried out on the optimized formulation to determine the in vitro SPIONs localization pattern in the presence of an external magnetic field (150. mT) in a simulated glass capillary to demonstrate its targeting potential. A biconvex pattern of aggregation was observed when observed for time, t= 0-100. s with the rate of localization decreasing as a function of time. The study was used to standardize CMC as a standard capping agent for the formulation of SPIONs, which have potential for numerous bio-medical applications, and to load rhodamine B as a water-soluble model molecule. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Significant progress has been made in the determination of the protein structures with their number today passing over a hundred thousand structures. The next challenge is the understanding and prediction of protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions. In this work we address this problem by analyzing curved solenoid proteins. Many of these proteins are considered as "hub molecules" for their high potential to interact with many different molecules and to be a scaffold for multisubunit protein machineries. Our analysis of these structures through molecular dynamics simulations reveals that the mobility of the side-chains on the concave surfaces of the solenoids is lower than on the convex ones. This result provides an explanation to the observed preferential binding of the ligands, including small and flexible ligands, to the concave surface of the curved solenoid proteins. The relationship between the landscapes and dynamic properties of the protein surfaces can be further generalized to the other types of protein structures and eventually used in the computer algorithms, allowing prediction of protein-ligand interactions by analysis of protein surfaces. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Background: Krishna Tulsi, a member of Lamiaceae family, is a herb well known for its spiritual, religious and medicinal importance in India. The common name of this plant is 'Tulsi' (or 'Tulasi' or 'Thulasi') and is considered sacred by Hindus. We present the draft genome of Ocimum tenuiflurum L (subtype Krishna Tulsi) in this report. The paired-end and mate-pair sequence libraries were generated for the whole genome sequenced with the Illumina Hiseq 1000, resulting in an assembled genome of 374 Mb, with a genome coverage of 61 % (612 Mb estimated genome size). We have also studied transcriptomes (RNA-Seq) of two subtypes of O. tenuiflorum, Krishna and Rama Tulsi and report the relative expression of genes in both the varieties. Results: The pathways leading to the production of medicinally-important specialized metabolites have been studied in detail, in relation to similar pathways in Arabidopsis thaliana and other plants. Expression levels of anthocyanin biosynthesis-related genes in leaf samples of Krishna Tulsi were observed to be relatively high, explaining the purple colouration of Krishna Tulsi leaves. The expression of six important genes identified from genome data were validated by performing q-RT-PCR in different tissues of five different species, which shows the high extent of urosolic acid-producing genes in young leaves of the Rama subtype. In addition, the presence of eugenol and ursolic acid, implied as potential drugs in the cure of many diseases including cancer was confirmed using mass spectrometry. Conclusions: The availability of the whole genome of O.tenuiflorum and our sequence analysis suggests that small amino acid changes at the functional sites of genes involved in metabolite synthesis pathways confer special medicinal properties to this herb. © 2015 Upadhyay et al.},

abstract={The usage of Internet banking has grown in leaps and bounds because of its appliance. The privacy and Information confidentiality is one of the richest invades to the users of Online Banking Systems. The issue with Online banking applications is that they need to send the confidential contents such as Personal Identification Number (PIN), One Time Password (OTP) to the targeting customers in the form of plaintext, which is insecure. The solvent to the above consequences requires a software-application that holds proficient encryption procedures. To improve the security of the content that is transmitted over the internet, the proposed technique introduce a Dual Enciphering Mechanism (DEM) which includes more than one cryptographic scheme for cipher text creation, which assures the secured transmission over the network environment and the application is developed in Java language as a secured dual enciphering intrigue (SDEI). In this nominated overture the confidential banking content such as personal identification number (PIN) is enciphered using Huffmann compression technique, which in turn subjected to symmetric encryption procedure and the key for the compression scheme is taken in the form of image, which is then transmitted in the form of image shares using the idea of visual cryptography. The content at the receiver end is submitted to deciphering process, which needs the symmetric crypto scheme key to get the intermediate code which in turn needs the image shares to regenerate the original plain text. Hence through the proposed scheme the security issues such as 'meet in the middle attacks' and 'anonymous hacking' would be reduced and from the experimental results it is identified that the proposed scheme works effectively in terms of memory occupation and execution time and grants secured transactions over the network. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) is one of the recognition motifs on the surface of hepatocytes, which promote their adhesion to extracellular matrix in liver tissue and appropriate artificial surfaces. ASGPR-mediated adhesion is expected to minimize trans-differentiation of hepatocytes in vitro that is generally observed in integrin-mediated adhesion. The aim of the present study is to verify the role of ASGPR in hepatocyte adhesion and proliferation in scaffolds for hepatic tissue engineering. Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy (SECM) is emerging as a suitable non-invasive analytical tool due to its high sensitivity and capability to correlate the morphology and activity of live cells. HepG2 cells and rat primary hepatocytes cultured in Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/Gelatin hydrogel scaffolds with and without galactose (a ligand for ASGPR) modification are studied using SECM. Systematic investigation of live cells cultured for different durations in scaffolds of different compositions (9:1 and 8:2 PVA:Gelatin with and without galactose) reveals significant improvement in cell-cell communication and proliferation on galactose incorporated scaffolds, thereby demonstrating the positive influence of ASGPR-mediated adhesion. In this work, we have also developed a methodology to quantify the respiratory activity and intracellular redox activity of live cells cultured in porous tissue engineering scaffolds. Using this methodology, SECM results are compared with routine cell culture assays viz., MTS ((1-Oxyl-2,2,5,5,-tetramethyl-δ3-pyrroline-3-methyl) Methanethiosulfonate) and Albumin assays to demonstrate the better sensitivity of SECM. In addition, the present study demonstrates SECM as a reliable and sensitive tool to monitor the activity of live cells cultured in scaffolds for tissue engineering, which could be used on a routine basis. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This paper deals with the fault diagnosis operation of a cement kiln process using structural analysis technique. Graph-based technique of fault detection and isolation is the unique methodology that can cope with the diagnosis design for cement plant which is of highly complexity and non-linearity. Structural analysis is a graph-based powerful tool that helps to analyze the system properties. By generating the Analytical Redundancy Relation (ARR) the fault diagnosis operation is carried out. Structural analysis consists of set of constraints that model the system normal behavior. Fault is the violation of one or more constraints. Structural analysis is able to determine which constraints in the system deviate from normal and determines which faults can be detected and isolated. Other system properties like reachability, monitorability and controllability are also addressed. This technique is performed using SaTool which is a MATLAB based structural analysis tool. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Ethylene glycol (EG) plays an important role as coolant in sub-artic and artic regions owing to its low freezing point. However one of the limitations of ethylene glycol for energy management is its low thermal conductivity, which can be improved by addition of nanoparticles. In the present work, cupric oxide nanoparticles have been synthesized followed by dispersion in ethylene glycol through extended probe ultrasonication without addition of chemical dispersing agent. Temperature dependency of thermal conductivity of 1 vol% CuO-ethylene glycol nanofluid exhibited a minimum at a critical temperature corresponding to lower thickness of interfacial layers and negligible Brownian motion. The influence of liquid layering on thermal conductivity was predominant at temperatures below critical temperature leading to higher thermal conductivity at lower temperature. Brownian motion-induced microconvection resulted in thermal conductivity increase with temperature above the critical temperature. About 14.1% enhancement in thermal conductivity was obtained at 50°C for 1 vol% CuO-ethylene glycol nanofluid. The viscosity of CuO-ethylene glycol nanofluid was lower than the viscosity of ethylene glycol at temperatures below 50°C and 120°C for 1 vol% and 0.5 vol% CuO-ethylene glycol nanofluids. Our data reveal that the CuO-ethylene glycol nanofluids are better coolants than ethylene glycol for transient cooling under constant heat flux conditions with 11.8% enhancement in heat transfer rate for 1 vol% CuO-ethylene glycol nanofluid. Hence the use of ethylene glycol-based nanofluids is a promising approach for energy management. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Asymmetry, boundary irregularity, color variegation, and diameter are popular clinical guidelines used for early detection of melanoma. Several researchers have proposed and framed methodologies to detect the melanoma using combined and separate features with the help of statistical theory, fuzzy logic, artificial neural networks, and machine learning techniques. When we combine all the techniques to quantify the four attributes (recently derived) within a single interface to diagnose melanoma skin lesion, it will be much complex and time consuming task. Hence, this paper proposes a novel methodology to detect melanoma skin cancer through phylogeny of pigmented skin lesions and it is a pilot scale attempt using the images of skin lesions. The construction of phylogeny has the following steps namely, the construction of image matrix, construction of image blocks, phylogenetic tree, and classification. Classification is implemented through average mean rank method as well as artificial neural networks. Performance of the proposed methodology is tested with 110 different images of skin lesions (BC cancer agency) and it is shown to predict 87 % successfully (melanoma/non-melanoma). The advantage of the proposed methodology is to predict the classification of melanoma skin lesions with the help of phylogeny achieves accuracy of 87 % with less time complexity. Some additional analysis is required for the remaining 13 % of images. Finally, it is proved that both average rank method and artificial neural network classification method predict almost the same accuracy. © 2015, The National Academy of Sciences, India.},

abstract={Chromium is recognized as a serious environmental pollutant because of high toxicity and carcinogenic properties. In this paper, we have developed cadmium sulfide quantum dots (CdS QDs) based fluorescence sensor for sensitive and selective detection of chromium ions. CdS QDs were synthesized by wet chemical method using pectin biopolymer as capping agent and taurine as an antioxidant. The fluorescence emission intensity of CdS QDs at 450 nm was selectively quenched by chromium ions, whereas other cations and anions showed negligible changes. The fluorescence intensity of CdS QDs is linearly proportional to the chromium concentration from 0.016 to 0.260 μM with a detection limit of 16 × 10-9 M. The proposed sensor recognizes chromium ion at a wide range of pH from 4 to 10. In addition, CdS QDs were also used to detect chromium ions in biological fluid, sewage water, pond water and tap water samples, with low interference. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Increased burden of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) in case of hyperglycemic conditions leads to the development of retinopathy, nephropathy, and cardiovascular and neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease. AGEs are considered as pro-oxidants, and their accumulation increases the oxidative stress. The prolonged exposure to these AGEs is the fundamental cause of chronic oxidative stress. Abnormal morphology of red blood cells (RBCs) and excessive eryptosis has been observed in diabetes, glomerulonephritis, dyslipidemia, and obesity, but yet the contribution of extracellular AGEs remains undefined. In this study, we investigated the effect of AGEs on erythrocytes to determine their impact on the occurrence of different pathological forms of these blood cells. Specifically, carboxymethyllysine (CML), carboxyethyllysine (CEL), and Arg-pyrimidine (Arg-P) which have been reported to be the most pre-dominant AGEs formed under in vivo conditions were used in this study. Results suggested the eryptotic properties of CML, CEL, and Arg-P for RBCs, which were evident from the highly damaged cell membrane and occurrence of abnormal morphologies. Methylglyoxal-modified albumin showed more severe effects, which can be attributed to the high reactivity and pro-oxidant nature of glycation end products. These findings suggest the possible role of AGE-modified albumin towards the morphological changes in erythrocyte’s membrane associated with diabetic conditions. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={In the next 20 years, energy consumption is expected to increase by 30%, coal consumption will increase by 53%, CO2 emission will increase by 39%, and Water deficit will be 40%. Energy and Water are top two global challenges in this Millennium. Presently coming to Indian Scenario, the population of India is 1.22 billion, the economy of India is 80 trillion rupees, Energy present is 21 quadrillion BTU, coal is 549 Million MT, Water present is 803 Billion M3 and CO2 emissions are 1.61 billion MT. These grave figures indicate the need that there is requirement for both Energy and Water and without harming the Environment. Present paper presents a solution for the above water and energy crisis.

abstract={The paper proposes a robust steganography technique to hide the data in an image. The method proposed uses Huffman coding to minimize the number of bits to be embedded and to improve the security of the information. The security aspect is also improved by using a cryptographic substitution cipher and quadrant based embedding of the data. The quadrant based embedding of data bits helps in distribution of bits uniformly over the entire image rather having concentrated data bits over a particular region. The quality of stego image and the embedding capacity is also improved by the usage of Huffman coding. LSB embedding technique is used in the algorithm for concealing the data in the image. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Streptomycin, an antibiotic used against microbial infections, inhibits the protein synthesis by binding to ribosomal protein S12, encoded by rpsL12 gene, and associated mutations cause streptomycin resistance. A streptomycin resistant, Lysinibacillus sphaericus DSLS5 (MIC >300 µg/mL for streptomycin), was isolated from a marine sponge (Tedania anhelans). The characterisation of rpsL12 gene showed a region having similarity to long terminal repeat sequences of murine lukemia virus which added 13 amino acids for loop formation in RpsL12; in addition, a K56R mutation which corresponds to K43R mutation present in streptomycin-resistant Escherichia coli is also present. The RpsL12 protein was modelled and compared with that of Lysinibacillus boronitolerans, Escherichia coli and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The modelled proteins docked with streptomycin indicate compound had less affinity. The effect of loop on streptomycin resistance was analysed by constructing three different models of RpsL12 by, (i) removing both loop and mutation, (ii) removing the loop alone while retaining the mutation and (iii) without mutation having loop. The results showed that the presence of loop causes streptomycin resistance (decreases the affinity), and it further enhanced in the presence of mutation at 56th codon. Further study will help in understanding the evolution of streptomycin resistance in organisms. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Electrospun nanofibrous scaffolds have gained momentum in regenerative medicine research due to their ECM-like architecture. The present study reports the fabrication of mesoporous silica nanofibers (MSF) and explores their potential to trigger osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) in the presence and absence of biochemical (induction) factors. BM-MSCs were seeded on MSF and allowed to differentiate into osteogenic lineage. Osteogenic differentiation of BM-MSCs was confirmed by mineralization staining, reduction in the expression of the stem cell marker CD105 and increase in the osteogenic marker osteocalcin. Cells cultured in MSF in the presence of induction media exhibited better adhesion, proliferation and differentiation. The phenotypic markers of osteoblasts such as mineralization and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity were higher on MSF in the presence of induction media when compared to MSF in the presence of normal media (p < 0.05). Upregulation of osteoblast specific genes (osteonectin, osteocalcin & alkaline phosphatase) suggests the potential of MSF to support osteogenic differentiation even in the absence of induction media (p < 0.05). In vitro results indicate that the nanotopography of MSF provided a favorable milieu for adhesion and proliferation of BM-MSCs. Further, the combination of the biomimetic nature of MSF, dissolution of silica ions (chemical cues) and biochemical cues presents a stable microenvironment for the differentiation of BM-MSCs into osteogenic lineage. In conclusion, the synergy of adhesion and proliferation cues in MSF along with suitable biochemical cues could be a promising design strategy to develop scaffolds for orchestrated bone healing. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.},

While many applications of ZnO thin films for gas sensing have been used, this paper proposes a novel technique in which ZnO thin films are patterned to form a lossy frequency selective surface (FSS). When the resistance of the ZnO changes with exposure to gas, there is a change in the amplitude and resonant frequency of the lossy FSS. A small change in the resonant frequency results in approximately 10 dB of amplitude shift at the original resonant frequency. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Genetic variations play a crucial role in differential phenotypic outcomes. Given the complexity in establishing this correlation and the enormous data available today, it is imperative to design machine-readable, efficient methods to store, label, search and analyze this data. A semantic approach, FROG: "FingeRprinting Ontology of Genomic variations" is implemented to label variation data, based on its location, function and interactions. FROG has six levels to describe the variation annotation, namely, chromosome, DNA, RNA, protein, variations and interactions. Each level is a conceptual aggregation of logically connected attributes each of which comprises of various properties for the variant. For example, in chromosome level, one of the attributes is location of variation and which has two properties, allosomes or autosomes. Another attribute is variation kind which has four properties, namely, indel, deletion, insertion, substitution. Likewise, there are 48 attributes and 278 properties to capture the variation annotation across six levels. Each property is then assigned a bit score which in turn leads to generation of a binary fingerprint based on the combination of these properties (mostly taken from existing variation ontologies). FROG is a novel and unique method designed for the purpose of labeling the entire variation data generated till date for efficient storage, search and analysis. A web-based platform is designed as a test case for users to navigate sample datasets and generate fingerprints. The platform is available at http://ab-openlab.csir.res.in/frog.

abstract={'Therminol 55' is one of the heat transfer fluids used in process industries and possesses low freezing and high boiling points. The thermal conductivity of Therminol 55 can be improved through dispersion of nanoparticles leading to nanofluids. Magnesium oxide (MgO) nanoparticles (25-45 nm) were synthesized from magnesium nitrate by reaction with ammonium carbonate at 80 °C, followed by calcination at 800 °C for 1 h. MgO-Therminol 55 nanofluid was prepared by dispersing MgO nanoparticles in Therminol 55 using oleic acid as dispersant, followed by bath ultrasonication. Thermal conductivity ratio of nanofluids was found to vary linearly with nanoparticle volume fraction, while exhibiting biphasic trend with respect to the influence of temperature. Liquid layering and micro-convection caused by Brownian motion were found to be dominant contributors of thermal conductivity enhancement at lower (10-30 °C) and higher (70-120 °C) temperatures respectively. Our data reveal linear increase in overall heat transfer coefficient with nanoparticle volume fraction under constant bath temperature condition, closely matching the thermal conductivity - nanoparticle volume fraction relationship. This is the first work on preparation, characterization and heat transfer performance of MgO-Therminol 55 nanofluids, highlighting its value for energy management. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Context: Metabolic syndrome and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are the emerging co-morbidities of skin inflammation. Occurrence of skin inflammation such as psoriasis is substantially higher in NAFLD patients than normal. Currently, there are no animal models to study the interaction between these co-morbidities. Objective: The present study seeks to develop a simple mouse model of NAFLD-enhanced skin inflammation and to study the effect of NAFLD on different parameters of skin inflammation. Materials and method: Metabolic syndrome and NAFLD were induced in C57BL/6 mice by feeding high-fat diet (HFD, 60% kcal) and high fructose liquid (HFL, 40% kcal) in drinking water. Skin inflammation was induced by repeated application of oxazolone (1% sensitization and repeated 0.5% challenge) in both normal and NAFLD mice and various parameters of skin inflammation and NAFLD were measured. Results: HFD and HFL diet induced obesity, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and histological features of NAFLD in mice. Oxazolone challenge significantly increased ear thickness, ear weight, MPO activity, NF-κB activity, and histological features of skin inflammation in NAFLD mice as compared with normal mice. Overall, induction of oxazolone-induced skin inflammation was more prominent in NAFLD mice than normal mice. Hence, HFD and HFL diet followed by topical oxazolone application develops metabolic syndrome, NAFLD, and enhanced skin inflammation in mice. Discussion and conclusion: This simple model can be utilized to evaluate a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of metabolic syndrome and NAFLD with skin inflammation and also to understand the nexus between these co-morbidities. © 2014 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

abstract={Abstract Despite the improvement in overall survival in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in the rituximab era, the occurrence of central nervous system (CNS) relapse heralds a very poor prognosis. The evidence is conflicting on the incidence and pattern of CNS relapse in the rituximab era compared with before the rituximab era and on the role of CNS prophylaxis. We conducted a systematic analysis of the data from 7 prospective studies, studying the incidence and type of CNS relapse, the role of prophylaxis, and survival after CNS relapse, with and without rituximab-based chemotherapy. No statistically significant difference was found in the incidence of CNS relapse with the use of rituximab-based chemotherapy compared with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine [Oncovin], prednisone) chemotherapy. Leptomeningeal disease was more common and the survival after CNS disease was better in the rituximab era. No difference was found in the incidence of isolated CNS relapse. Chemoprophylaxis significantly decreased the incidence of CNS recurrence. The use of rituximab has not influenced the incidence of CNS relapse compared with the use of CHOP. Chemoprophylaxis plays a significant role in high-risk patients with DLBCL in decreasing CNS recurrence. Large randomized clinical trials are warranted to differentiate between intrathecal and systemic chemoprophylaxis. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Curcumin is the yellow-colored bioactive constituent of the perennial plant, Curcuma longa L., which possesses a wide range of physiological and pharmacological properties such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, neuroprotective and anti-diabetic activities. Anti-diabetic activity of curcumin may be due to its potent ability to suppress oxidative stress and inflammation. Moreover, it shows a beneficial role on the diabetesinduced endothelial dysfunction and induces a down-regulation of nuclear factor-kappa B. Curcumin possesses a protective role against advanced glycation as well as collagen crosslinking and through this way, mitigates advanced glycation end products-induced complications of diabetes. Curcumin also reduces blood glucose, and the levels of glycosylated hemoglobin in diabetic rat through the regulation of polyol pathway. It also suppresses increased bone resorption through the inhibition of osteoclastogenesis and expression of the AP-1 transcription factors, c-fos and c-jun, in diabetic animals. Overall, scientific literature shows that curcumin possesses anti-diabetic effects and mitigates diabetes complications. Here we report a systematical discussion on the beneficial role of curcumin on diabetes and its complications with emphasis on its molecular mechanisms of actions. © 2015 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={Three different coumarin coupled pyrene derivatives with varying hydrophobic units (alkyl chains) have been synthesised and well characterized using NMR and mass spectral analysis. The gelation behaviour and self-aggregation properties of these compounds were studied relative to the molecular structure and solvent affinity. Among these derivatives, the one which is not having any hydrophobic tail displays efficient gelation in higher alcohols such as decanol and dodecanol. However the other derivatives having saturated and unsaturated hydrophobic tails form weak gel in different solvents. The morphology of gel was investigated by optical microscopy and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The investigation of absorption and emission spectra of these compounds revealed that the photo-physical properties were significantly influenced by the self-assembly process in different solvents. The concentration dependent emission and 1H NMR studies clearly suggest that the π-π stacking interaction and hydrogen bonding between carbonyl groups of coumarin coupled pyrene with the -OH group of solvent were the driving forces for the process of gelation and self-aggregation. Rheological investigation clearly demonstrates the flow behaviour and reversible nature of organogel under temperature and strain ramp up and ramp down experimental conditions. By getting clue from the self-assembly mechanism in different solvents, we derived nano-flakes from coumarin coupled pyrene derivatives and further explored their potential applications in the field of cell imaging. The size of the self-aggregated particles in the DMSO-water mixture has been identified using HRTEM and a zetasizer. The nanomaterials obtained via the self-assembly process were used for fibroblast and PC3 prostate cancer cell imaging applications. Further investigation reveals that these compounds suppress the proliferation of PC3 cells. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.},

abstract={Several conventional methods have been used for many years to accelerate the growth in decapod crustaceans but they are not suitable for aquaculture practices due to their harmful effects on the animals. Concern over water quality, environmental hazards, human health and food safety has led us to search for alternative targets, to design growth enhancers which can significantly improve the growth of crustaceans without harmful effects. Among such compounds is CGE-1, an amine compound which has shown excellent molt inducing property. Lobsters treated with CGE-1 exhibited a higher weight gain and greater increment in the carapace length post-molt as compared to the controls even without inhibiting the synthesis and secretion of molt-inhibiting hormone (MIH). This is a significant finding considering the fact that MIH binds specifically to the membrane receptor of y-organs, hence CGE-1 might interfere with this interaction allowing an incessant production of 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E). Here, we summarize our findings on CGE-1 and its effects with particular focus on inclusive growth and vitellogenesis. Our observations and findings suggest that CGE-1 could be a useful growth enhancer that could be used either alone or as a dietary supplement for the rapid growth of decapod crustaceans. © 2015 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={Surface and groundwater are often contaminated with toxic anions such as arsenic and selenium. Because of their large surface areas, selenium adsorption on carbon sorbents is considered an attractive water treatment technique. In this present work, selenium sorption on copper-impregnated activated carbon and fly ash-extracted char carbon was evaluated. Unburned carbon was extracted from fly ash using froth floatation techniques, and the carbon sorbents were modified using copper ions. Adsorption experiments confirmed the strong influence of electrostatic forces on equilibrium uptakes of selenite (Se (IV)) and selenate (Se (VI)). Selenium sorption on virgin char carbon was maximum only at acidic pH, i.e., at pH∈<∈pH<inf>pzc</inf> (pH at point of zero charge). Upon copper modification of the carbon surface, the pH<inf>pzc</inf> shifted towards the alkaline region, and as a result, the positive charge density on the carbon surface increased. At pH∈>∈pH<inf>pzc</inf>, a two- to fourfold increase in sorption coverage and threefold increase in selenium percent removal was observed. Se (IV) sorption was higher compared to Se (VI) sorption. The effect of selenium concentrations and competing anions was studied to evaluate adsorbent performance. The order of maximum surface coverage followed the order: modified char carbon∈>∈modified activated carbon∈>∈char carbon. The main mechanism of selenium (Se) sorption appeared to be (1) electrostatic attraction of the Se ions to the modified carbon surface at acidic to neutral pH; (2) complexation of Se ions with the copper ions/oxides on the carbon surface; and (3) co-precipitation with copper hydroxides at alkaline pH. © 2015 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

Polymorphic crystals obtained from CH<inf>3</inf>CN (DPAMBM-1) and CH<inf>3</inf>OH (DPAMBM-2) exhibited fluorescence at 588 nm and 538 nm, respectively. Single crystal analysis showed a slightly twisted molecular conformation between aminophenyl (donor) and malononitrile (acceptor) and the molecules are well separated in the crystal lattice. Whereas linear molecular conformation and strong intermolecular interaction with anti-parallel dipole arrangement were observed in DPAMBM-2. Slight breaking and strong grinding of DPAMBM-1 crystals showed blue shifting of fluorescence to 571 nm and 562 nm, respectively. Interestingly, annealing/solvent vapor exposure further blue shifts the fluorescence to 545 nm and converts the ground powder to DPAMBM-2. Strong grinding of DPAMBM-2 red shifted the fluorescence to 562 nm and annealing/vapor exposure switched back to 545 nm. DPAMBM-2 was converted to DPAMBM-1 by annealing at 120 °C that tuned the fluorescence from 538 nm to 572 nm and mechanical grinding and annealing further blue shifts the fluorescence to 545 nm. Nanofabrication of DPAMBM also showed fluorescence tuning from 562 nm to 536 nm due to morphological changes. Thus DPAMBM showed a rare combination of gradual fluorescence tuning from 588 nm to 536 nm and an external stimulus controlled phase change with fluorescence switching between 545 nm and 562 nm. © 2015 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={Oscillatory behaviour is essential for proper functioning of various physical and biological processes. However, diffusive coupling is capable of suppressing intrinsic oscillations due to the manifestation of the phenomena of amplitude and oscillation deaths. Here we present a scheme to revoke these quenching states in diffusively coupled dynamical networks, and demonstrate the approach in experiments with an oscillatory chemical reaction. By introducing a simple feedback factor in the diffusive coupling, we show that the stable (in)homogeneous steady states can be effectively destabilized to restore dynamic behaviours of coupled systems. Even a feeble deviation from the normal diffusive coupling drastically shrinks the death regions in the parameter space. The generality of our method is corroborated in diverse non-linear systems of diffusively coupled paradigmatic models with various death scenarios. Our study provides a general framework to strengthen the robustness of dynamic activity in diffusively coupled dynamical networks. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Abstract Owing to the use of quantum dots in biological labeling, and the specific interaction of lectins with tumor cells, studies on lectin-QDs interaction are of potential interest. Herein, we report a facile method to prepare zinc sulfide quantum dots (ZnS QDs) using pectin as a capping agent and studied their interaction with snake gourd seed lectin (SGSL) by fluorescence spectroscopy. The QDs were characterized by X-ray diffraction, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, UV-Vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. The thermodynamic forces governing the interaction between ZnS-QDs and SGSL have been delineated from the temperature dependent association constant. These results suggest that the binding between ZnS QDs and SGSL is governed by enthalpic forces with negative entropic contribution. The red shift of synchronous fluorescence spectra showed that the microenvironment around the tryptophan residues of SGSL was perturbed by ZnS-QDs. The obtained results suggest that the development of optical bioimaging agents by using the conjugated lectin-QDs would be possible to diagnose cancerous tissues. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Putatively functional polymorphisms of one-carbon and xenobiotic metabolic pathways influence susceptibility for wide spectrum of diseases. The current study was aimed to explore gene–gene interactions among these two metabolic pathways in four diseases i.e. breast cancer, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), coronary artery disease (CAD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD). Multifactor dimensionality reduction analysis was carried out on four case–control datasets. Cross-talk was observed between one-carbon and xenobiotic pathways in breast cancer (RFC 80 G>A, COMT H108L and TYMS 5′-UTR 28 bp tandem repeat) and SLE (CYP1A1 m1, MTRR 66 A>G and GSTT1). Gene–gene interactions within one-carbon metabolic pathway were observed in CAD (GCPII 1561 C>T, SHMT 1420 C>T and MTHFR 677 C>T) and PD (cSHMT 1420 C>T, MTRR 66 A>G and RFC1 80 G>A). These interaction models showed good predictability of risk for PD (The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (C) = 0.83) and SLE (C = 0.73); and moderate predictability of risk for breast cancer (C = 0.64) and CAD (C = 0.63). Cross-talk between one-carbon and xenobiotic pathways was observed in diseases with female preponderance. Gene–gene interactions within one-carbon metabolic pathway were observed in diseases with male preponderance. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={Owing to the benign nature, plant extracts mediated green synthesis of metal nanoparticles (NPs) is rapidly expanding. In this study, we demonstrated the successful green synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) by utilizing natural sunlight and redox protein complex composed of ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase (FNR) and ferredoxin (FD). The capping and stabilization of the AgNPs by the redox protein was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Light and redox protein is the prerequisite factor for the formation of AgNPs. The obtained result shows that the photo generated free radicals by the redox protein is responsible for the reduction of Ag+ to Ag0. Transmission electron microscopy revealed the formation of spherical AgNPs with size ranging from 10 to 15 nm. As-prepared AgNPs exhibit excellent catalytic activity toward the degradation of hazardous organic dyes, such as methylene blue, methyl orange and methyl red. These bio-inspired AgNPs is highly sensitive and selective in sensing hazardous mercury ions in the water at micromolar concentration. In addition, FNR/FD extract stabilized AgNPs showed good antimicrobial activity against gram positive and gram negative bacteria. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Abstract The ever increasing energy demand put forth biofuels a favorable choice over fossil fuels due to their renewability, biodegradability and generating exhaust gases of acceptable quality. Biofuels can be solid, liquid or gaseous in nature and are mainly produced from the biomass that includes biochar, bioethanol, biobutanol, biodiesel, biohydrogen and biomethane. These fuels can be produced by processing and hydrolyzing the lignocellulosic biomass derived from agricultural and forestry waste. Pretreatment and hydrolysis of these waste materials involves either thermochemical processes or biological processes. The traditional thermochemical approach involves harsh environmental conditions and the usage of strong chemicals. This may lead to the equipment corrosion, large volume of waste streams and additional problem in disposal or treatment of chemicals. So it is preferred to have low energy required enzymatic process to every possible step in the biofuel production. The steps chosen for the biofuel production and the enzymes used depend on the type of biofuel produces and the feedstock used. This review provides a complete overview of diversified sources for biofuel production and highlights the criteria for enzymes involved in various processes of biofuels. Further, the bioengineering strategies like recombinant technology and metabolic engineering for improving the efficiency of these enzymes at each possible step were discussed. Perspectives and future directions to enhance the biomass conversion to biofuels were also described. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

Through both numerical and analytical studies, we show that the candidate which is capable of resurrecting oscillations is nothing but the feedback, the one which is profoundly used in dynamical control and in biotherapies. Even in the case of a rather general system, we demonstrate analytically the applicability of the technique over one of the oscillation quenched states called amplitude death states. We also discuss some of the features of this mechanism such as adaptability of the technique with the feedback of only a few of the oscillators. © 2015 American Physical Society.},

abstract={Most of the metal ions are carcinogens and lead to serious health concerns by producing free radicals. Hence, fast and accurate detection of metal ions has become a critical issue. Among various metal ions arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury and chromium are considered to be highly toxic. To detect these metal ions, electrochemical biosensors with interfaces such as microorganisms, enzymes, microspheres, nanomaterials like gold, silver nanoparticles, CNTs, and metal oxides have been developed. Among these, nanomaterials are considered to be most promising, owing to their strong adsorption, fast electron transfer kinetics, and biocompatibility, which are very apt for biosensing applications. The coupling of electrochemical techniques with nanomaterials has enhanced the sensitivity, limit of detection, and robustness of the sensors. In this review, toxicity mechanisms of various metal ions and their relationship towards the induction of oxidative stress have been summarized.

abstract={Green synthesis of cupric oxide nanoparticles has been carried out from copper sulphate pentahydrate using the water extract of Murrya koenigi. The components present in the water extract react with copper sulphate pentahydrate to form an intermediate, which upon calcination at 300 °C resulted in the formation of cupric oxide. The synthesized nanoparticles were spherical in shape and about 33-40 nm in size. X-Ray diffraction pattern confirmed the crystalline nature of cupric oxide. The green-synthesized cupric oxide nanoparticles possess excellent photocatalytic activity with about 80 % dye degradation in 10 min from initial concentration of 50 ppm.},

The substitution of nitrogen in InP nanotube slightly widens the band gap. The substitution of nitrogen and aluminium in InP nanostructure modifies the density of states across InP nanotube. The electron density is found to be more on phosphorus sites than indium sites. The substitution of aluminium increases the electron density, whereas nitrogen substitution decreases the electron density across phosphorus site. The transmission spectrum provides the insight to transmission along InP nanotube molecular device. The transmission pathways get modified with the substitution impurity along InP nanotube molecular device.

abstract={The electronic and geometrical structures of neutral and charged YOn (n=2-12) clusters have been investigated using density functional theory (DFT) with generalized gradient approximation. The oxygen atom in YOn has been found to be in oxo, peroxo and in superoxo forms. The geometrical structures and topologies of small size anionic clusters resemble that of neutral clusters. Yttrium showed higher coordination number than scandium. Computed results reveal the existence of YO<inf>10</inf> cluster to have a penta-peroxo oxygen with a homoleptic Y(η2 -O<inf>2</inf>)<inf>5</inf> geometrical configuration. The HOMO-LUMO gaps decrease with increasing n due to the increase in 2p orbital population of oxygen atoms. It has been shown that in these clusters bonding are predominantly ionic in nature and anions are thermodynamically more stable, due to the charge delocalization between the metal atom and oxygen ligands. YO<inf>10</inf>+ and YO<inf>12</inf>+ were found to be highly exothermic to release one and two oxygen molecules, while YO<inf>11</inf>+ dissociates though the ozonide dissociation channel. Computed absorption spectra of small clusters are mainly contributed by yttrium metal d and s valence orbitals. The absorbance spectra, shifts towards lower energy with cluster size increase, while charge has no substantial effect on the absorption spectrum. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Tuberculosis is a chronic disease caused by various strains of Mycobacterium, primarily by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which usually attacks lungs. The enzyme fattyacid synthase is essential for survival of the Mycobacteria and hence it has become a potential chemotherapeutic target. Pyrazinamide, a prodrug, in combination with the antibiotics is being used as a paradoxical frontline drug against the infections and the enzyme pyrazinamidase present in the bacteria converts the prodrug into pyrazinoic acid, an inhibitor to fatty acid synthase. However, six species of mycobacterium such as M. bovis, M. kansasii, M. avium, M. smegmatis, M. abscessus and M. marinum are resistant to pyrazinamide due to the random mutations in the primary sequences of the pyrazinamidases. In this study, computational rationalization for the differential binding affinities of pyrazinamide on the binding grooves of pyrazinamidase variants from various species of Mycobacterium could be derived in order to bring an insight on the mechanisms behind the pyrazinamide-resistance of the pyrazinamidases. In these contexts, we have herein demonstrated that absence or ill-formed ‘GATE’ regions of pyrazinamidases may act as probable structural factors for the differential binding affinities of the pyraziamidase variants towards the interaction with pyrazinamide (PZA) and as well PZA-resistant properties of the enzymes. © 2015, Pharmainfo Publications.

Xylan was isolated from waste biomass, wheat bran (WB) by alkaline treatment and was characterized by Fehling's test, dinitrosalicylic acid assay, FTIR, 1H NMR and 13C NMR. The synthesized nanoparticles were characterized by UV-Vis spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The nanoparticles were polydispersed with the size ranging from 20 to 45 nm. The synthesized WB-xylan AgNPs showed excellent free radical scavenging activity. In addition, WB-xylan AgNPs showed fibrinolytic activity as evidenced by the zone of clearance in fibrin plate assay. The biomedical potential of the WB-xylan AgNPs was demonstrated by dissolution of preformed blood clots.

abstract={Penicillium chrysogenum DSOA, a strain previously isolated from the sponge Tedania anhelans collected off the Indian Ocean had showed potential activity against Mycobacterium smegmatis. It is found to be a potential candidate in the search for novel anti-TB drugs, and hence a need to produce active components in larger quantities. One way of accomplishing is this through the optimization of growth conditions including, the incubation period, initial pH, NaCl concentration, and carbon and nitrogen sources. Thus a combination of techniques- classical one factor at a time (OFAT) approach and statistical Plackett Burman approach was used. The OFAT was used to select the ideal carbon and nitrogen sources from a panel, and Plackett Burman used to study the significance of these chosen factors. Glucose and calcium nitrate were found as suitable carbon and nitrogen sources by classical method. Glucose was found to enhance the activity 3.75 fold and calcium nitrate 1.625 fold. Glucose at 1.25% (w/v), calcium nitrate at 1% (w/v), and sodium chloride at 4.25% (w/v) in the medium with incubation period for 21 days at an initial pH of 7 with nutrient broth as basal medium was found to enhance the anti-mycobacterial metabolite production of DSOA. In the case of glycerol asparagine broth as the basal medium, Glucose concentration at 0.5% (m/v), calcium nitrate at 1.5%, sodium chloride at 0.5% or 8% at an initial ph of 11 incubated for 21 days was shown to increase the production of the desired secondary metabolite. The secondary metabolite production was found to be significantly different between the complex media and defined media. © 2015, Pharmainfo Publications. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={Abstract Poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) and PCL-gelatin random and aligned nanofibers with diameters in the range of 200-400 nm were developed through electrospinning. Mechanical properties of aligned PCL and PCL-gelatin nanofibers were compared, and it was found that aligned PCL nanofibers showed significantly higher tensile strength and Young's modulus than the PCL-gelatin nanofiber system (p<0.05). The in vitro degradation of aligned nanofibers showed that PCL-gelatin nanofibers degrade faster than aligned PCL nanofibers. Further, human smooth muscle cells were cultured on the random and aligned PCL-gelatin nanofibers and evaluated for adhesion, orientation, morphology, viability, proliferation and gene expression. Our results demonstrate that PCL-gelatin promotes higher cell adhesion and proliferation than the PCL nanofibers after 3, 7, and 10 days of culture. Aligned topography favored orientation of the cells along their directions and cell stretching was better in aligned nanofibers than the random nanofibers. The upregulation of α-actin, myosin heavy chain, collagen type I, and elastin genes demonstrate good cell-matrix interactions in both random and aligned scaffolds. Therefore, the present study concludes that aligned PCL-gelatin nanofibers could serve as potential scaffolding for culture of smooth muscle cells and may promote functional regeneration of tubular organs. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Secured sharing of the diagnostic reports and scan images of patients among doctors with complementary expertise for collaborative treatment will help to provide maximum care through faster and decisive decisions. In this context, a tri-layer cryptic solution has been proposed and implemented on Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) images to establish a secured communication for effective referrals among peers without compromising the privacy of patients. In this approach, a blend of three cryptic schemes, namely Latin square image cipher (LSIC), discrete Gould transform (DGT) and Rubik's encryption, has been adopted. Among them, LSIC provides better substitution, confusion and shuffling of the image blocks; DGT incorporates tamper proofing with authentication; and Rubik renders a permutation of DICOM image pixels. The developed algorithm has been successfully implemented and tested in both the software (MATLAB 7) and hardware Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) environments. Specifically, the encrypted data were tested by transmitting them through an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel model. Furthermore, the sternness of the implemented algorithm was validated by employing standard metrics such as the unified average changing intensity (UACI), number of pixels change rate (NPCR), correlation values and histograms. The estimated metrics have also been compared with the existing methods and dominate in terms of large key space to defy brute force attack, cropping attack, strong key sensitivity and uniform pixel value distribution on encryption. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The role of trace elements in dengue virulence is not yet known. The present study assessed the serum levels of two micronutrients, copper and iron, in cases of dengue fever. The study involved 96 patients of whom 48 had either severe or non-severe forms of dengue (with and without warning signs), and the remaining 48 were patients with other febrile illnesses (OFI), used as controls. Serum levels of copper and iron were evaluated at admission and by the time of defervescence using commercially available kits. At admission, no difference in the level of serum copper was observed between cases and controls. In the group of dengue cases, the copper level was found to be significantly decreased in severe and non-severe cases with warning signs, compared to non-severe cases without warning signs. In contrast, by the time of defervescence the copper level was found to be increased in all dengue cases compared to OFI controls, but no difference was observed among dengue cases. Unlike OFI controls, dengue cases showed an increasing pattern of copper levels from admission until defervescence. On the other hand, no such significant differences were observed in the serum level of iron in the clinical groups, except for a decreased iron level found in severe cases, compared to non-severe dengue without warning signs. The results show that copper is associated with dengue severity and this finding emphasizes the need to investigate the involvement of trace elements in disease severity so as to improve the prognosis of dengue. © 2015, Instituto de Medicina Tropical de Sao Paulo.

abstract={Essential oils (EOs) from the leaves of one of the patchouli oil yielding wild species, Pogostemon plectranthoides (PP) collected from three bio-geographical regions in India namely, Western Ghats (WG), Central India (CI) and Northeast India (NEI) were characterized using GC-FID and GC-MS. Chemical analyses showed that the EOs were rich in sesquiterpenes and exhibited wide variation in the chemical compositions. A total of 90 volatile components in the oils were identified, of which only eight were present in the oils of all three regions. Tyrosinase inhibitory and anti-inflammatory activities of the EOs were studied using in vitro assays, which showed that all three oils exhibited both activities. However, the degree of activities varied. Studies on kinetic behavior of the EOs showed that the oils of PP from WG and CI were mixed type inhibitors, whereas the oil from NEI was a competitive inhibitor. Among the EOs studied, the oil from NEI demonstrated high activities. The EO of PP may be used in cosmetics and skin care products as it exhibited tyrosinase inhibitory and anti-inflammatory activities. © 2015.},

abstract={The impact of orange peel coupling on spin current induced magnetization switching in a Co/Cu/Ni-Fe nanopillar device is investigated by solving the switching dynamics of magnetization of the free layer governed by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski (LLGS) equation. The value of the critical current required to initiate the magnetization switching is calculated analytically by solving the LLGS equation and verified the same through numerical analysis. Results of numerical simulation of the LLGS equation using Runge-Kutta fourth order procedure shows that the presence of orange peel coupling between the spacer and the ferromagnetic layers reduces the switching time of the nanopillar device from 67 ps to 48 ps for an applied current density of 4 × 1012Am-2. Also, the presence of orange peel coupling reduces the critical current required to initiate switching, and in this case, from 1.65 × 1012Am-2 to 1.39 × 1012Am-2. © 2015 Author(s).},

abstract={Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Streptococcus [GAS]) is an important human pathogen that causes several superficial infections and invasive diseases. The ability of GAS to form biofilms, renders the pathogen resistant to several antimicrobials resulting in antibiotic treatment failure. As essential oils (EOs) from plants have been promising sources of anti-biofilm agents, the present study shows that EOs from the genus Pogostemon exhibit anti-biofilm activity against pharyngitis causing GAS. The biofilm inhibition ability of the EOs varied depending upon the serotype of GAS, which was evident from confocal microscopy. Fourier transfer infra red (FT-IR) spectroscopy indicated that both the EOs disrupted the fatty acid membrane of the biofilms in all the serotypes. Overall, this study forms a first report on the anti-biofilm activity of the EOs of Pogostemon species and this can be a novel natural resource to combat drug resistant pathogenic biofilms. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Abstract The presence of captan residues in apples shows high toxicity, which often causes eye and skin irritation, dermatitis, conjunctivitis, and vomiting in humans. In this context, an electrochemical biosensor based on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) immobilized on a ZnO nanorod interface has been proposed. In this work, Hill, dose-response, and first-, second-, and third-order polynomial regression models were successfully applied and the prediction ability of these models was tested with the use of current density obtained from the cyclic voltammograms of appropriate captan solutions. The Pt/ZnO/AChE bioelectrode showed a high sensitivity of 0.538 μA cm-2μM-1 in the linear range from 0.05 to 25.0 μM with a limit of detection of 107 nM. The recovery results were observed between 98.4 and 102.4 % from the apple sample. This work provides a new promising tool for the detection of captan in apple samples. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Molecular dynamics simulations have been employed to study the hydration of a series of nanoparticles, each of which was coated with a mixed self-assembled monolayer (SAM) comprising methyl- and hydroxy-terminated alkane thiol chains. The mixing ratio of those chains are different for each nanoparticle. The simulations focused on the wetting behavior of the SAM-coated gold nanoparticles and the distribution and structure of their interfacial water molecules. The interactions of the mixed SAM-coated gold nanoparticles with water were analyzed by evaluating the radial distribution function, hydrogen bonds, the dipole orientations of the water molecules, and the water residence time in the interfacial region. The wettability of the mixed SAM-coated gold nanoparticles improved as the concentration of terminal hydroxy moieties was increased. The distribution and dynamics of the interfacial water molecules were found to be influenced by the mixing ratio of the terminal moieties of the SAM chains. The results of our simulations suggest that the surface interactions of the mixed SAM-coated gold nanoparticles with the aqueous medium can be modulated by systematically altering the mixing ratio of the terminal methyl and hydroxy moieties. This work may lead to new biological and technological applications and inspire the development of novel biomimetic materials.

abstract={Abstract In the present study, the extracts were prepared from rice hulls using solvent, acid and alkali hydrolysis treatments and their in vitro antioxidant potential was evaluated. Among various solvent extraction methods used to recover the polyphenolic extract, grinding in morter and pestle with 75% ethanol yielded maximum total phenolic concentration (240.14 mg FAE/L). Between acid and alkali treatments, alkali hydrolysis (932.14 mg FAE/L) is more effective than acid hydrolysis (674.29 mg FAE/L) in recovering phenolic compounds. Moreover, alkali hydrolysate exhibited higher antioxidant potential in terms of radical scavenging against DPPH (78.96%), superoxide (85.22%), hydroxyl (71.54%) radicals and hydrogen peroxide (78.64%). Further, the ferric reducing power (0.739 absorption units) and phosphomolybdate assays (1458 AEAA/mg sample) also indicated the high antioxidant activity of alkali hydrolysate of rice hulls when compared to acid hydrolysate and solvent extract. Hence, alkali hydrolysis treatment could be recommended for the maximum recovery of total phenolic compounds from rice hulls. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

Further, a chimera is shown to emerge in a wide range of the asymmetry parameter in contrast to near π2 values of it employed in earlier works. We have also corroborated our results using the strength of incoherence in the frequency domain (Sω) and in the amplitude domain (S), thereby distinguishing the frequency and amplitude chimeras. The robust nature of the asymmetry parameter in inducing chimeras in any generic dynamical system is established using ensembles of identical Rössler oscillators, Lorenz systems, and Hindmarsh-Rose neurons in their chaotic regimes. © 2015 American Physical Society.},

abstract={Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEF) are proteins that regulate the activity of GTPases by catalysing the exchange of GDP for GTP. In this work, we studied the interaction of various Rho family GTPases CDC42, Rac1 and RhoA with GEFmeso, a GEF expressed in Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly). The interaction of GEFmeso with Rho family GTPases was studied by means of guanine nucleotide exchange assays. Our results suggest that GEFmeso interacts with Rac1 in addition to its interaction with CDC42 and Ral, which was reported earlier. We propose that the guanine nucleotide exchange factor GEFmeso is involved in a developmental process that requires the synergistic action of CDC42 and Rac1 during Drosophila development. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Desmotachya bipinnata L. (Darbha) is a tropical grass used as an inevitable material in traditional practices and rituals of the Indian Hindus. Darbha, the sacred grass has been used to prevent spoilage of fermentable food during solar and lunar eclipses, which is being followed even today. However, the reason for choosing this grass among several other grass species has not been reported. In this work, while exploring the reason behind the choice of this grass for traditional practices, interesting hierarchical nanoscale morphology of Darbha grass revealed in scanning electron microscopy. To understand the role of Darbha in food preservation during eclipse, cow’s curd has been chosen a representative fermentable food item. Systematic investigation on Darbha grass grown in three different microhabitats has been performed, and their effect on the population and diversity of lactobacilli from cow’s curd has been studied. Interestingly, the grass with the most prominent nanoscale features is found to remove most of the lactobacilli from cow’s curd. Thus, Darbha reduces microbial accumulation in fermentable food items when the bactericidal ultraviolet and blue radiations are not available to the earth surface during eclipse. The disinfecting ability of Darbha is compared with five other tropical grasses chosen on the basis of presence/absence of micro/nanofeatures, antibacterial effect and hydrophobic surface. The other grasses used in this study are Chloris Barbata L., Apluda aristata L., Cynodon dactylon L., Bamboosa arundinacae L. and Cymbopogon citratus L. Based on comparative studies with these grasses, the mechanism of disinfecting ability of Darbha is attributed mainly to the hierarchical micro/nanofeatures present on the grass surface. The results of the present investigation could be used to design novel biomimetic antibacterial surfaces for applications including health care. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Abstract In this paper, 2D numerical modeling on the optical characteristics of a triple material gate stack gate all-around (TMGSGAA) MOSFET has been developed and presented. The device characteristics under illumination are obtained from the self-consistent solution of 2D Poisson-Schrödinger equation using Liebmann's iteration method. The drain and transfer characteristics, electric field, transconductance, photocurrent, photocurrent gain and responsivity of the device have been estimated. The effect of different high-k materials on the device characteristics under illumination has also been discussed. The numerical results are validated with ATLAS TCAD simulation results of the device under dark condition. The model is purely a physics based one and overcomes the major limitations of the existing models by providing more accurate results. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Background: Longstanding ulcerative colitis (UC) bears a high risk for development of UC-associated colorectal carcinoma (UCC). The inflammatory microenvironment influences microRNA expression, which in turn deregulates target gene expression. microRNA-26b (miR-26b) was shown to be instrumental in normal tissue growth and differentiation. Thus, we aimed to investigate the impact of miR-26b in inflammation-associated colorectal carcinogenesis. Methods: Two different cohorts of patients were investigated. In the retrospective group, a tissue microarray with 38 samples from 17 UC/UCC patients was used for miR-26b in situ hybridization and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analyses. In the prospective group, we investigated miR-26b expression in 25 fresh-frozen colon biopsies and corresponding serum samples of 6 UC and 15 non-UC patients, respectively. In silico analysis, Ago2-RNA immunoprecipitation, luciferase reporter assay, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction examination, and miR-26b mimic overexpression were employed for target validation. Results: miR-26b expression was shown to be upregulated with disease progression in tissues and serum of UC and UCC patients. Using miR-26b and Ki-67 expression levels, an UCC was predicted with high accuracy. We identified 4 novel miR-26b targets (DIP1, MDM2, CREBBP, BRCA1). Among them, the downregulation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase DIP1 was closely related to death-associated protein kinase stabilization along the normal mucosa-UC-UCC sequence. In silico functional pathway analysis revealed that the common cellular pathways affected by miR-26b are highly related to cancerogenesis and the development of gastrointestinal diseases. Conclusions: We suggest that miR-26b could serve as a biomarker for inflammation-associated processes in the gastrointestinal system. Because miR-26b expression is downregulated in sporadic colon cancer, it could discriminate between UCC and the sporadic cancer type. © 2015 Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America, Inc.},

abstract={Vanadium pentoxide (V<inf>2</inf>O<inf>5</inf>) films were deposited on cleaned silicon (Si) and glass substrates by reactive dc magnetron sputtering at different sputtering powers (50-70 W) at room temperature (RT). Microstructural, morphological, topological, optical and electrical properties of the films were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission-scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), UV-vis spectroscopy and four point probe method (FPP) respectively to analyze the impact of the sputtering power on the properties of V<inf>2</inf>O<inf>5</inf> films. The average grain size of the films increased from 77 to 90 nm on increasing the sputtering power and also all the deposited films showed characteristic peaks in the range 920-970 cm-1 in Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) spectrum corresponding to the V<inf>2</inf>O<inf>5</inf>. The optical bandgap and electrical resistivity of the films were found to be decreased while increasing the sputtering power. Four probe electrical resistivity measurements show the typical semiconductor behavior of the deposited film. The film deposited at 70 W sputtering power at RT exhibited a temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) of -1.22%/°C and resistivity (R<inf>s</inf>) of 22 Ω m. The low sputtering power used and room temperature deposition of the V<inf>2</inf>O<inf>5</inf> films in the present investigation is suitable for complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.All rights reserved.},

abstract={Levan is a homopolymer of fructose naturally obtained from both the plants and microorganisms. Along with the general properties of a biopolymer like bio-compatibility, bio-degradability, renewability, flexibility, and eco-friendliness, levan also offers some important biomedical properties such as anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-carcinogenic, anti-AIDS and hyperglycaemic inhibitor. In this study, we have demonstrated the microbial production of therapeutically potential levan by batch fermentation process in sucrose rich medium using Acetobacter xylinum NCIM 2526. The produced Levan was characterized using various physicochemical techniques such as FTIR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR spectroscopy, TGA and HPLC. The biomedical potential of the isolated A. xylinum levan for its anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities was exploited in vitro. Further the present study also focused on the optimization of levan production using one factor at a time approach followed by a statistical method, central composite design (CCD) with selected variables. The yield of levan was increased significantly from 0.54 to 13.25 g/L with the optimized variables. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The service provided by the Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) should provide better quality as Quality of the network plays an important role in the improving the performance of the system. The dynamic topology and resource constraints of WSN are highly challenging in achieving QoS. Thus in this paper Quality of Service (QoS) is improved for some of the QoS parameters like packet loss and congestion. Categorization of nodes as qualified and unqualified is done using the parameters. The quality node then dynamically forms a network. A novel method to improve the QoS based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is used to train the unqualified nodes to make them as quality nodes. The structure of Artificial Neural Networks provides less complexity compared to other Computational Intelligence (CI) tools as wireless sensor networks are prone to many constraints like memory and energy it reduces the computation cost and time. Our Simulation results shows that the proposed system has better performance in improving the QoS by increasing the network lifetime and reducing the packet loss ratio.},

abstract={In this paper, the possibility of using recycled aggregate (RA) and ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) to produce a structural concrete was studied by compromising strength to a lesser extent. Hence an attempt has been made to study the strength and durability characteristics of the GGBFS-based recycled aggregate concrete. Four different groups of mixes were designed by replacing natural coarse aggregate (NA) 0, 25, 50 and 100% with recycled coarse aggregates. In each group the effect of RA was studied by replacing cement with GGBFS in different percentages from 20 to 50% with an increment of 10%. The effects of RA and GGBFS on fresh and hardened concrete properties were studied and the results were compared with natural aggregate concrete (NAC) and optimum replacement of RA and GGBFS was also found. Experimental results indicate that increase in concrete strength for all NA replacements with RA for GGBFS concrete upto 40% at the age of 90 days and further addition of GGBFS shows reverse trend. © Shiraz University.},

abstract={In this paper the choice of power quality compensator is a DSTATCOM which constitutes a four leg voltage source converter (VSC) and a DC capacitor. An artificial neural network (ANN) based synchronous reference frame (SRF) theory is proposed for the generation of gating pulse of the DSTATCOM to balance the source current, eliminate harmonics and to compensate neutral current and reactive power in three phase four wire (3P4W) distribution system. In the proposed control strategy ANN controllers replace the PI controllers and low pass filters of conventional method. ANN controllers are also implemented to keep up the voltage across the capacitor and as a compensator to compensate neutral current under unbalanced load conditions. Various transformer topologies are simulated and compared with the proposed control strategy for compensation of neutral current. The DSTATCOM performance is adjudged under balanced, unbalanced and/or distorted voltage source conditions through simulation using MATLAB software. Data extracted from the experiment conducted in the laboratory to study the effect of non-linear load are used in the simulation to prove the efficacy of the proposed control strategy in power quality improvement. © 2015 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.},

abstract={The purpose of this study was to determine the intracellular signaling transduction pathways involved in oxidative stress induced by nanoparticles in cancer cells. Activation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) has some therapeutic benefits in arresting the growth of cancer cells. Cobalt oxide nanoparticles (CoO NPs) are an interesting compound for oxidative cancer therapy. Our results showed that CoO NPs elicited a significant (P <0.05) amount of ROS in cancer cells. Co-treatment with N-aceyltine cystine (an inhibitor of ROS) had a protective role in cancer cell death induced by CoO NPs. In cultured cells, the elevated level of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) was noted after CoO NPs treatment. This TNF-α persuaded activation of caspase-8 followed by phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and induced cell death. This study showed that CoO NPs induced oxidative stress and activated the signaling pathway of TNF-α-Caspase-8-p38-Caspase-3 to cancer cells. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={A convenient catalyst-free, three-component procedure was developed for the synthesis of tetrasubstituted pyrroles under solvent-free conditions and in green solvents glycerol, PEG-200 and water. A sequential enamine-formation, Michael addition and intramolecular cyclization of primary amines, 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds and isatin-derived Michael acceptors afforded 3-(1H-pyrrol-3-yl)indolin-2-ones in excellent yields. In this simple one-pot transformation the requirement of column chromatography purification of the products was completely avoided. Besides, the method is highly environmentally benign and atom-economical, and the only side product of this reaction was two molecules of water. A comparative study for the four developed conditions showed that the solvent-free conditions were superior regardless of the nature of the starting materials, and the green solvents were effective for alkyl and benzylamines affording higher yields compared to arylamines. The preliminary in vitro cytotoxic studies of a representative compound against Ehrlich's ascites carcinoma (EAC) tumor cells showed significant activity with a CTC50 value of 15.64 μM. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.},

The corresponding linear diboron chelate complexes (Ph<inf>2</inf>B[1,3-bis(iminopyrrolyl)-phenyl]BPh<inf>2</inf> (10), Ph<inf>2</inf>B[1,4-bis(iminopyrrolyl)-phenyl]BPh<inf>2</inf> (11), Ph<inf>2</inf>B[4,4′-bis(iminopyrrolyl)-biphenyl]BPh<inf>2</inf> (12), Ph<inf>2</inf>B[1,5-bis(iminopyrrolyl)-naphthyl]BPh<inf>2</inf> (13), Ph<inf>2</inf>B[2,6-bis(iminopyrrolyl)-naphthyl]BPh<inf>2</inf> (14), Ph<inf>2</inf>B[2,6-bis(iminopyrrolyl)-anthracenyl]BPh<inf>2</inf> (15)) and the star-shaped triboron complex ([4′,4′′,4′′′-tris(iminopyrrolyl)-1,3,5-triphenylbenzene](BPh<inf>2</inf>)<inf>3</inf> (16)) were obtained in moderate to good yields, by the treatment of 3-9 with B(C<inf>6</inf>H<inf>5</inf>)<inf>3</inf>. The ligand precursors are non-emissive, whereas most of their boron complexes are highly fluorescent; their emission color depends on the π-conjugation length. The photophysical properties of the luminescent polyboron compounds were measured, showing good solution fluorescence quantum yields ranging from 0.15 to 0.69. DFT and time-dependent DFT calculations confirmed that molecules 10 and 16 are blue emitters, because only one of the iminopyrrolyl groups becomes planar in the singlet excited state, whereas the second (and third) keeps the same geometry. Compound 13, in which planarity is not achieved in any of the groups, is poorly emissive. In the other examples (11, 12, 14, and 15), the LUMO is stabilized, narrowing the gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO-LUMO), and the two iminopyrrolyl groups become planar, extending the size of the π-system, to afford green to yellow emissions. Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) were fabricated by using the new polyboron complexes and their luminance was found to be in the order of 2400 cd m-2, for single layer devices, increasing to 4400 cd m-2 when a hole-transporting layer is used. Bridge the gap: Luminescent linear and star-shaped polynuclear organoboron complexes containing iminopyrrolyl ligands linked by aryl bridges were synthesized, showing good luminescent properties depending on π-conjugation lengths of the molecules (see figure). Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) were successfully fabricated with the new boron complexes, achieving luminance values of up to 4400 cd m-2. © 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.},

abstract={Estimating oxidative stability with successive heating temperatures provides a qualitative assessment of oil in the food industry. As one of the prime factors contributing to oil characteristics, the flow behavior of highly refined sesame oil and mustard oil were determined experimentally between the temperatures 25 and 85°C. The variation of viscosity with temperature was fitted in two variable empirical equations and the mathematical models were compared. Various physicochemical parameters of the oils like conductivity, density, viscosity, ultrasonic velocity, saponification value, iodine value, and free fatty acid content were observed to estimate their characteristics and stability on heating to cooking temperature. The physical and chemical parameters were compared and correlated between the oils to analyze the oxidative stability at different times of heating. A novel relation was demarcated between ultrasonic velocity and the chemical parameters. The study helped in the identification of the best oil suited for repeated cycles of heating. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={We analyze the consequences of symmetry breaking in the coupling in a network of globally coupled identical Stuart-Landau oscillators. We observe that symmetry breaking leads to increased disorderliness in the dynamical behavior of oscillatory states and consequently results in a rich variety of dynamical states. Depending on the strength of the nonisochronicity parameter, we find various dynamical states such as amplitude chimera, amplitude cluster, frequency chimera, and frequency cluster states. In addition we also find disparate transition routes to recently observed chimera death states in the presence of symmetry breaking even with global coupling. We also analytically verify the chimera death region, which corroborates the numerical results.

abstract={Experiments were performed to study the transient heat transfer characteristics of probe-ultrasonicated, surfactant-free, ZnO-propylene glycol (ZnO-PG) nanofluids under constant heat flux and constant bath temperature conditions. Under constant heat flux conditions, ZnO-PG nanofluids exhibited linear increase in heat removal rates with increasing nanoparticle concentration. An enhancement of 4.24% in heat transfer rate was observed with 2 vol.% ZnO-PG nanofluid. The overall heat transfer coefficient and nanofluid-side heat transfer coefficient under constant bath temperature condition were found to increase with increasing nanoparticle volume concentration. About ∼26% increase in coolant side heat transfer coefficient was obtained with 2 vol.% ZnO-PG nanofluid under constant bath temperature condition which could be attributed to thermal conductivity enhancement as well as improved natural convection due to viscosity reduction. Our results indicate that the surfactant-free, ZnO-PG nanofluids behave like liquid coolants but with improved thermal conductivity and specific heat and hence suitable for energy management. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={CuS nano/microstructures with different morphologies, such as solid microspheres with blocks (1-CuS), nanospheres (2-CuS) and microspheres of nanoflakes (3-CuS), were synthesized using alanine based coordinating ligands (1-3) as structure controlling agents in hydrothermal synthesis. Interestingly, copper coordination polymers (4 and 5) that were prepared using the same ligand (2) but differed subtly in the coordination and water molecule presence produced distinctly different nano/microstructures. Hydrogen-bonded network polymer 4 gave CuS microspheres composed of nanocrystals (4-CuS) whereas coordination network polymer without water molecules 5 yielded nanocrystalline powdered materials (5-CuS). Importantly, the synthesised CuS nano/microcrystals exhibited dye degradation (methylene blue (MB), methyl orange (MO) and Rhodamine blue (RB)) at room temperature without using any specific light source. The CuS nano/microcrystals also showed morphology dependent dye degradation properties. The most efficient dye degradation was observed for nanosphere 2-CuS whereas 1-CuS and 4-CuS exhibited comparatively slow dye degradation. Thus, the present work demonstrates the utility of simple coordinating ligands and subtle changes in the coordination network for tuning CuS morphologies which showed morphology dependent dye degradation. © 2015 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={Streptococcus mutans, a Gram positive facultative anaerobe, is one among the approximately seven hundred bacterial species to exist in human buccal cavity and cause dental caries. Quorum sensing (QS) is a cell-density dependent communication process that respond to the inter/intra-species signals and elicit responses to show behavioral changes in the bacteria to an aggressive forms. In accordance to this phenomenon, the S. mutans also harbors a Competing Stimulating Peptide (CSP)-mediated quorum sensing, ComCDE (Two-component regulatory system) to regulate several virulence-associated traits that includes the formation of the oral biofilm (dental plaque), genetic competence and acidogenicity. The QS-mediated response of S. mutans adherence on tooth surface (dental plaque) imparts antibiotic resistance to the bacterium and further progresses to lead a chronic state, known as periodontitis. In recent years, the oral streptococci, S. mutans are not only recognized for its cariogenic potential but also well known to worsen the infective endocarditis due to its inherent ability to colonize and form biofilm on heart valves. The review significantly appreciate the increasing complexity of the CSP-mediated quorum-sensing pathway with a special emphasis to identify the plausible drug targets within the system for the development of anti-quorum drugs to control biofilm formation and associated risks. © 2015, Association of Microbiologists of India.},

abstract={Background: Recent evidence suggests the neurotrophic potential of hepatitis C virus (HCV). HCV NS3 protein is one of the potent antigens of this virus mediating inflammatory response in different cell types. Microglia being the immune surveillance cells in the central nervous system (CNS), the inflammatory potential of NS3 on microglia was studied. Role of toll like receptor (TLR) ligands Pam2CSK3 and Pam3CSK4 in controlling the NS3 mediated microglial inflammation was studied using microglial cell line CHME3. Methods: IL (Interleukin)-8, IL-6, TNF-α (Tumor nicrosis factor alpha) and IL-1β gene expressions were measured by semi quantitative RT-PCR (reverse transcription-PCR). ELISA was performed to detect IL-8, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-10 secretion. FACS (Flourescent activated cell sorting) was performed to quantify TLR1, TLR2, TLR6, MyD88 (Myeloid differntiation factor 88), IkB-α (I kappaB alpha) and pNF-κB (phosphorylated nuclear factor kappaB) expression. Immunofluorescence staining was performed for MyD88, TLR6 and NF-κB (Nuclear factor kappaB). Student's t-test or One way analysis of variance with Bonferoni post hoc test was performed and p < 0.05 was considered significant. Results: Microglia responded to NS3 by secreting IL-8, IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1β via TLR2 or TLR6 mediated MyD88/NF-κB pathway. Transcription factor NF-κB was involved in activating the cytokine gene expression and the resultant inflammatory response was controlled by NF-κB inhibitor, Ro106-9920, which is known to down regulate pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. Activation of the microglia by TLR agonists Pam3CSK4 and Pam2CSK4 induced immune tolerance against NS3. TLR ligand treatment significantly down regulated pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion in the microglia. IL-10 secretion was suggested as the possible mechanism by which TLR agonists induced immune tolerance. NS3 as such was not capable of self-inducing immune tolerance in microglia. Conclusion: In conclusion, NS3 protein was capable of activating microglia and the inflammatory response could be controlled via blocking the transcription factor NF-κB, or by treating the microglia with TLR ligands which likely function via secreting anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10. This can have therapeutic potential in controlling HCV mediated neuroinflammation. © 2015 Rajalakshmy et al.

abstract={In the retina, Müller glia is a dominant player of immune response. The HIV-1 transactivator viral protein (Tat) induces production of several neurotoxic cytokines in retinal cells. We show that HIV-1 clades Tat B and C act differentially on Müller glia, which is reflected in apoptosis, activation of cell death pathway components and pro-inflammatory cytokines. The harsher immune-mediated pathology of Tat B, as opposed to milder effects of Tat C, manifests at several signal transduction pathways, notably, MAPK, STAT, SOCS, the NF? B signalosome, and TTP. In activated cells, anandamide (AEA), acting as an immune-modulator, suppresses Tat B effect through MKP-1 but Tat C action via MEK-1. AEA lowers nuclear NF-? B and TAB2 for both variants while elevating IRAK1BP1 in activated Müller glia. Müller glia exposed to Tat shows enhanced PBMC attachment. Tat-induced increase in leukocyte adhesion to Müller cells can be mitigated by AEA, involving both CB receptors. This study identifies multiple signalling components that drive immune-mediated pathology and contribute to disease severity in HIV clades. We show that the protective effects of AEA occur at various stages in cytokine generation and are clade-dependant.},

abstract={Cloud computing renders umpteen number of services such as offering computing resources like processing power, storage of data and user applications. Load balancing in cloud computing is of paramount importance. As the request floods in, certain nodes might become heavily loaded. So it is essential to spread the load uniformly among the nodes. On the whole load balancing enhances the overall performance of the system and provides proper utilization of resources. In this paper, a review of prevailing load balancing approaches in cloud environment is presented and evaluated against various metrics such as throughput, fault tolerance, scalability, migration time and resource utilization.},

abstract={(AKI) Pactamycin, although putatively touted as a potent antitumor agent, has never been used as an anticancer drug due to its high cytotoxicity. In this study, we characterized the effects of two novel biosynthetically engineered analogs of pactamycin, de-6MSA-7-demethyl-7-deoxypactamycin (TM-025) and 7-demethyl-7-deoxypactamycin (TM-026), in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines SCC25 and SCC104. Both TM-025 and TM-026 exert growth inhibitory effects on HNSCC cells by inhibiting cell proliferation. Interestingly, unlike their parent compound pactamycin, the analogs do not inhibit synthesis of nascent protein in a cell-based assay. Furthermore, they do not induce apoptosis or autophagy in a dose- or a time-dependent manner, but induce mild senescence in the tested cell lines. Cell cycle analysis demonstrated that both analogs significantly induce cell cycle arrest of the HNSCC cells at S-phase resulting in reduced accumulation of G<inf>2</inf>/M-phase cells. The pactamycin analogs induce expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins including master regulator p53, its downstream target p21Cip1/WAF1, p27kip21, p19, cyclin E, total and phospho Cdc2 (Tyr15) and Cdc25C. Besides, the analogs mildly reduce cyclin D1 expression without affecting expression of cyclin B, Cdk2 and Cdk4. Specific inhibition of p53 by pifithrin- α reduces the percentage of cells accumulated in S-phase, suggesting contribution of p53 to S-phase increase. Altogether, our results demonstrate that Pactamycin analogs TM-025 and TM-026 induce senescence and inhibit proliferation of HNSCC cells via accumulation in S-phase through possible contribution of p53. The two PCT analogs can be widely used as research tools for cell cycle inhibition studies in proliferating cancer cells with specific mechanisms of action. © 2015 Guha et al.},

abstract={Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) assures to revolutionize sensing in a spatially dispersed and dedicated manner in various applications. It requires adopting a security mechanism for critical applications. Though many cryptographic algorithms are available it strength depends upon the key used for encrypting and decrypting the collected data. Key Management Scheme (KMS), a technique for establishing and maintaining the key relation, play a vital role in any security mechanism. The proposed work was focused on pairwise key establishment using QR based matrix Decomposition method. Though many metrics are available the prime factor for any WSN is key connectivity. The proposed KMS focuses on 100% key connectivity compared to probabilistic approach. For each communications different symmetric matrices are generated and are decomposed into Q and R matrix. This scheme is implemented in LPC2148 with Xbee to check its feasibility in real time applications. Performance analysis shows that the proposed method achieves 100% key connectivity, better resilience and scalability.},

abstract={VM) is a fundamental highlight of "virtualization" that permits transition of a running VM from one physical server to the next without interrupting the VM. The main aim of this paper is to migrate the virtual machines in the cloud environment and thus avoid threats and vulnerabilities. In the previous technique, Protection Aegis for Live Migration (PALM) is used in which the virtual machines migrate in three different methods. They are Process Migration, Memory Migration and Resume/Suspend Migration. The main drawback of the existing technique is the performance degradation due to high downtime. But in the proposed technique, the migration of virtual machines is carried out by using XEN hypervisor which uses Regular and Live Migration techniques. In that XEN hypervisor, the Multi- Pass Algorithm is used to perform migration in an efficient way. When compared with other techniques, the XEN server has an advantage of lower total migration time for virtual machine migration. In earlier live migration, the current execution of running virtual machine is paused and then the VM is migrated to the destination server. After reaching the destination, the execution of virtual machine is resumed. So the migration time is very high. But in proposed method, the current execution of the virtual machine is not paused. The execution of the VM is not interrupted and also the migration time is very low. Also the downtime for migration is reduced by using XEN server. This improves the efficiency and performance by reducing the migration time and down time during live migration of virtual machines. This helps the business providers and industries to increase their productivity.},

This paper proposes Energy aware Data Aggregation with Sink Relocation (EDASR) technique to improve the network lifetime. The nodes that are closer to sink will consume additional energy than others to compute and communicate data to sink. Based on the residual energy sink will relocate to another position. During Energy Aware Data Aggregation (EADA) both the Hop Count (hpc) and shortest distance to reach the sink is considered for clustering. The simulation is performed using ns-2.34 in Ubuntu for different initial battery energy and transmission range. Simulation results prove that EDASR method improves network lifetime by increasing number of rounds of message relaying until the first relocation occurs than the existing sink relocation algorithm.},

abstract={Cloud is an arising and a massive technical development of this modern era which offers variety of services to satisfy the needs of multiple users.

Ciphertext Policy Attribute Based Encryption is a proficient technique for addressing this security issue, in which the owner of the data will create a control structure for encrypting the information. Decryption is possible when the peculiar attributes of the users satisfies that access control tree. Private keys for the users will be generated based on the attributes of the users. Another aspect to be considered in this technique is key escrow problem where single third party authority has the ability to decrypt the ciphertext which might contain sensitive information. In order to overcome this problem multiple authority CP-ABE is introduced. In the proposed scheme key generation for the users will issued by separate key generation authority and attributes of the users will be managed by attribute management authority. So none of the authority can decrypt data holder's secret information. Authorities cannot pool data so the collision attack is not possible.

abstract={The measurement and study of liquid films in the case of two phase flows is significant in many heat transfer and mass transfer applications, such as chemical process industries, micro reactors, coating processes and in boilers. The focus of the present study was to measure and characterize the thickness of the liquid films for various two phase flow regimes in conventional and in mini channels using a non-intrusive technique. Experiments were performed on tubes of diameters 0.6, 1.5, 2.6 and 3.4mm. The superficial velocities of gas and liquid are in the range of 0.01–50 and 0.01–3m/s, respectively. The flow patterns were recorded with a high speed camera. A method to determine the two phase flow velocity using image registration has been discussed. Morphological processing and gray scale analysis were used to determine the liquid film thickness and characterize the flow regimes. The flow patterns identified are bubbly, dispersed bubbly, slug, slug-annular, wavy-annular, stratified, and annular. The flow regimes were validated with flow maps available in the literature. The liquid film thickness was identified by distance transform technique in image processing. The magnitude of film thickness varied with liquid and gas flow velocities. The film thickness was represented in terms of capillary number. The variation in film thickness along the length of the flow regime has been discussed. A relation between the liquid film thicknesses measured using the non-intrusive image processing technique and capillary number for the conventional and mini tubes is proposed based on the analysis. (Formula Presented)It is concluded from the proposed correlation that the variation in liquid film thickness is different for conventional and mini channels because of the effect of inertial dominance in conventional channels and viscous dominance in mini channels. © 2014, Korean Institute of Chemical Engineers, Seoul, Korea.},

abstract={Neural network based p-q theory control strategy for shunt active power filter and neural network based synchronous reference frame (SRF) theory control strategy for series active power filter are proposed in this paper to compensate power quality issues related to current and voltage respectively through Unified Power Quality Conditioner (UPQC) in three phase four wire (3P4W) distribution system for various balanced/unbalanced loads and balanced /unbalanced/distorted source conditions. The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) controllers are designed to replace the low pass filters (LPF) and proportional-integral controllers of the conventional control strategy. ANN controllers are also implemented to maintain voltage across the capacitor and as a compensator to compensate neutral current under varying conditions of source and load. The proposed control strategies mitigate harmonic/reactive currents and voltage harmonics, ensure balanced and sinusoidal source current from the supply mains that are nearly in phase with the supply voltage. The performance of the UPQC with proposed ANN controllers is validated and investigated through simulations using MATLAB software. The simulation results prove the efficacy of the proposed neural network based control strategy under varying source and load conditions. © 2015 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l.-All rights reserved.},

abstract={A coastal geomorphic survey was undertaken along the southeast coast of Tamil Nadu from Rameswaram to Kanyakumari. Geomorphic interaction between sea–land formed the marine notches. The notches are used to delineate the significant sea level changes and local and regional tectonic activities. Based on the carbon dating method during the Mid-Holocene period, the sea level is expected to have been at least 1 m above from the present global mean sea level. But the altitude of these notches is approximately 12 to 25 m from the current average mean sea level. Notches corresponding to this sea level suggest the slow long-term uplift along the coastal tracts of southeast coast of Tamil Nadu. © 2014, Saudi Society for Geosciences.},

First, motivation for the employment of damper bars in IPMSM is provided and justified with a case study. Thereafter, a mathematical model of an IPMSM drive with damper bars in the rotor has been developed based on dq-axis theory and validated through experiments performed on a laboratory IPMSM containing damper bars. The validated mathematical model has been then employed to arrive at satisfactory rotor bar parameters for an existing IPMSM on board a commercially available EV. Moreover, a replica of the existing onboard EV motor with and without incorporating dampers have been designed, and finite-element analysis has been performed to investigate various performance characteristics. Comparative performance analyzes of both the machines with and without damper bars under steady-state and transient conditions have been performed wherever necessary, and the results elicited have been discussed. © 1982-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={The inception of phosphors provoked the need of highly efficient lighting sources for the conceivable next generation applications. In this regards, a striking characteristic material namely the mesoporous silica (MPS) and their series that are quite distinct to each other in their physical properties have been synthesized by adopting a cooperative self-assemble strategy. Utilizing it, the development of high-performance Sr1-xCa1-yEux+ySiO4 phosphor was traversed using a simple wet-solid phase process. Systematic investigations on morphological, structural, and few other physical properties were carried out. The derived results are intriguing with a crystal clear alteration in the phosphor morphology when MPS has been used as a silicate source. Subsequent luminescence studies displayed its efficient yellow-emitting property covering the red spectral components, along with good thermal luminescence stability. Perhaps, the designed prototype LEDs yielded a color correlation temperature (CCT) &lt; 5000 K and color rendering index (CRI) &gt; 80. Therefore, it directs the way for the fabrication of potential warm white LEDs with a long-lived emission efficacy and high thermal luminescence stability. © 2015 The American Ceramic Society.},

abstract={A triphenylamine-based fluorophore, 4-((4-methoxyphenyl)(phenyl)amino)benzaldehyde (1), exhibits external-stimuli-responsive self-reversible solid-state fluorescence switching, tunable fluorescence, and a rare phenomenon of temperature-dependent fluorescence. Mechanically grinding a crystalline powder of 1 converts the blue fluorescence (λ<inf>max</inf> = 457 nm) to green (λ<inf>max</inf> = 502 nm), but blue fluorescence robustly self-recovers within 8 min. X-ray analysis and theoretical studies suggest that the change from a highly twisted molecular conformation and crystalline form into an amorphous phase with more planar conformation is responsible for the fluorescence switching. Self-reversible fluorescence switching did not show a significant change in fluorescence for several cycles of measurement. Interestingly, 1 in toluene showed a rare phenomenon of fluorescence enhancement with increasing temperature via activating more vibrational bands that lead to stronger twisted intramolecular charge-transfer (TICT) emissions. Morphological-change-mediated fluorescence tuning has also been demonstrated by fabricating nanoparticles of 1. The conversion of highly polydispersed, featureless, different-shaped nanoparticles into nearly uniformly sized spherical nanoparticles (20-25 nm) converts green (λ<inf>max</inf> = 502 nm) to blue fluorescence (λ<inf>max</inf> = 478 nm). The self-reversible multi-stimuli-responsive fluorescence switching and polymorphism and nanofabrication-mediated fluorescence tuning suggest its potential application in sensors, particularly for fluorescent thermometers. © 2015 American Chemical Society.},

Interestingly, the first tetra-cationic binuclear calcium 2 was isolated using L2H<inf>2</inf>Br<inf>2</inf> and hexa-cationic trinuclear calcium 6 was isolated using L6H<inf>3</inf>Br<inf>3</inf>. The 3D coordination polymers 1 and 4 were derived with the help of L1H<inf>2</inf>Br<inf>2</inf> and L4H<inf>2</inf>Br<inf>2</inf>, respectively, through Br⋯H hydrogen bonding. The 3D MOF 3 with rhomboidal channels was constructed using L3H<inf>2</inf>Br<inf>2</inf>, where the channel size is about 4.8 × 2.9 nm. 5 was isolated as a rare 1D coordination polymer. The choice of azolium carboxylates in these solids not only changes the topology of the network but also affects the chemistry exhibited by the network. Calcium azolium carboxylate assemblies 1-4 and 6 exhibit interesting solid-state photoluminescence properties, driven by azolium carboxylate ligands. Variation of the bridging chromophore produced significant effects on the fluorescence properties. 1-4 and 6 represent the first examples of luminescent calcium azolium carboxylate complexes. As can be seen in the six metal-organic assemblies presented in this report, a combination of carboxylate groups and steric hindrance affects the topology and physical properties of the resultant solids. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.},

abstract={Background: Proteins interact with a variety of other molecules such as nucleic acids, small molecules and other proteins inside the cell. Structure-determination of protein-protein complexes is challenging due to several reasons such as the large molecular weights of these macromolecular complexes, their dynamic nature, difficulty in purification and sample preparation. Computational docking permits an early understanding of the feasibility and mode of protein-protein interactions. However, docking algorithms propose a number of solutions and it is a challenging task to select the native or near native pose(s) from this pool. DockScore is an objective scoring scheme that can be used to rank protein-protein docked poses. It considers several interface parameters, namely, surface area, evolutionary conservation, hydrophobicity, short contacts and spatial clustering at the interface for scoring. Results: We have implemented DockScore in form of a webserver for its use by the scientific community. DockScore webserver can be employed, subsequent to docking, to perform scoring of the docked solutions, starting from multiple poses as inputs. The results, on scores and ranks for all the poses, can be downloaded as a csv file and graphical view of the interface of best ranking poses is possible. Conclusions: The webserver for DockScore is made freely available for the scientific community at: http://caps.ncbs.res.in/dockscore/. © Malhotra et al.; licensee BioMed Central.},

abstract={Understanding how functional lipid domains in live cell membranes are generated has posed a challenge. Here, we show that transbilayer interactions are necessary for the generation of cholesterol-dependent nanoclusters of GPI-anchored proteins mediated by membrane-adjacent dynamic actin filaments. We find that long saturated acyl-chains are required for forming GPI-anchor nanoclusters. Simultaneously, at the inner leaflet, long acyl-chain-containing phosphatidylserine (PS) is necessary for transbilayer coupling. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations of asymmetric multicomponent-membrane bilayers in a mixed phase provide evidence that immobilization of long saturated acyl-chain lipids at either leaflet stabilizes cholesterol-dependent transbilayer interactions forming local domains with characteristics similar to a liquid-ordered (lo) phase. This is verified by experiments wherein immobilization of long acyl-chain lipids at one leaflet effects transbilayer interactions of corresponding lipids at the opposite leaflet. This suggests a general mechanism for the generation and stabilization of nanoscale cholesterol-dependent and actin-mediated lipid clusters in live cell membranes. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Background: Cyclooxygenase (COXs) and Lipoxygenase (LOXs) pathways are the two major enzymatic pathways in arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism. The term eicosanoid is used to describe biologically active lipid mediators including prostaglandins, thromboxanes, leukotrienes and other oxygenated derivatives, which are produced primarily from AA. Eicosanoids generated in a tissue specific manner play a key role in inflammation and cancer. As AA is the substrate common to variety of COXs and LOXs, inhibition of one pathway results in diversion of the substrate to other pathways, which often is responsible for undesirable side effects. Hence there is need for development of not only isozyme specific inhibitors but also dual/multi enzyme inhibitors. Understanding the interactions of AA and characterizing its binding sites in these enzymes therefore is crucial for developing enzyme specific and multi enzyme inhibitors for enhancing therapeutic efficacy and/or overcoming side effects. Results: AA binding sites in COXs and LOXs are identified and compared by the development of receptor based pharmacophore using MultiBind. Physico chemical properties were compared to understand the details of the binding sites in all the enzymes and to elucidate important amino acids that can be targeted for drug design. The alignment of AA binding sites in the seven enzymes COX-1, COX-2, 5-LOX, 12-LOX, 15-LOX and plant soybean LOX-1 and LOX-3 indicated a common pattern of five common interacting groups. In the same way, comparison of AA binding sites was done pair wise and by multiple alignment in various combinations. It has been identified that aliphatic and aromatic interactions are the most common in all the enzymes. In addition interactions unique to each one of these enzymes were identified. Conclusion: The complete analysis of AA binding sites in the seven enzymes was performed; 120 combinations for the seven enzymes were studied in detail. All the seven enzymes are structurally quite different, yet they share AA as the common binding partner. Comparisons in various combinations showed how they are similar and dissimilar with each other. This information will be helpful in designing specific as well as common inhibitors. © 2015 Kumar et al.; licensee BioMed Central.},

abstract={Conditions required to enhance a particular species efficient in degradative capabilities is very useful in wastewater treatment processes. Paracoccus sp. is known to efficiently reduce nitrogen oxides (NOx) due to the branched denitrification pathway. Individual-based simulations showed that the relative fitness of Paracoccus sp. to Pseudomonas sp. increased significantly with nitrate levels above 5 mM. Spatial structure of the biofilm showed substantially less nitrite levels in the areas of Paracoccus sp. dominance. The simulation was validated in a laboratory reactor harboring biofilm community by fluorescent in situ hybridization, which showed that increasing nitrate levels enhanced the abundance of Paracoccus sp. Different levels of NOx did not display any significant effect on biofilm formation of Paracoccus sp., unlike several other bacteria. This study shows that the attribute of Paracoccus sp. to tolerate and efficiently reduce NOx is conferring a fitness payoff to the organism at high concentrations of nitrate in a multispecies biofilm community. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={Objective: To develop a process that involves optimization of the amount of baicalein and pinostrobin from the hydro-methanolic extract of the leaves of Scutellaria violacea by response surface methodology (RSM). Materials and Methods: The combinatorial influence of various extraction parameters on the extraction yield was investigated by adopting Box-Behnken experimental design. Preliminary experiments carried out based on the traditional one variable at a time optimization revealed four such operational parameters to play a crucial role by influencing the yield. These four process parameters at three levels were considered to obtain the Box-Behnken experimental design. Results: RSM based model fitted to the resulting experimental data suggested that 52.3% methanol/water, 12.46:1 solvent-solid ratio, 285 rpm agitation and 6.07 h of extraction time are the optimal conditions which yielded a maximized amount of baicalein and pinostrobin of 2.9 and 4.05 mg/g DM. Analysis of variance revealed a high correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.999 for baicalein and 0.994 for pinostrobin), signifying a good fit between the regression model (second order) and the experimental observations. Conclusion: The present study signifies that both the metabolites have been extracted from S. violacea for the first time. Further, this study developed an optimized extraction procedure to obtain maximum yield of the metabolites, which is unique and better than conventional extraction methodology. The operational parameters under optimized conditions accounts for the lowest cost in extraction process thus, providing an efficient, rapid and cost-effective method for isolation and scale up of these commercially vital flavonoids.},

The polyimides were characterized by FT-IR, 1H-NMR, X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetry (TG), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), solution viscosity, and solubility test. The X-ray diffraction patterns indicated that all these polyimides were amorphous and soluble in common organic solvents. Thermogravimetry analysis indicated that the polyimides exhibit good thermal stability, and 10 % weight loss occurred in the temperature range 375 to 429 °C. The limited oxygen index (LOI) values of polyimides were in the range 36.3 to 37.5 and such PIs can be used as self extinguishing polymers. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={This paper attempts to reduce power loss in radial distribution network and facilitates improvement in bus voltage profile by determining optimal locations and optimal sized shunt capacitors. Particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) is embedded with Artificial Bee Colony algorithm (ABC) to balance exploration and exploitation ability to improve the solution accuracy and the convergence rate of the ABC algorithm as Particle-ABC (PABC) algorithm. In the first formulation, the capacitor placement is based on loss sensitivity factors (LSF) and thereafter decides on the optimal rating of capacitors through the use of proposed hybrid algorithm (PABC).The second approach encircles the role of PABC algorithm to search for the optimal candidate nodes within the nodes nominated by LSF and the optimal sizing of shunt capacitors simultaneously in the pursuit of enhancing the performance of radial distribution network with the former approach. The procedure travels to examine the robustness of the strategy on 41 and 69 nodes test systems with different load models at different load conditions and the simulation results are compared with the heuristic techniques existing in the literature. The simulation results reveal the efficiency and robustness of the PABC to find the optimal solution for capacitor placement problem. © 2015 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.},

abstract={The increasing urbanization with climate change, global warming issues and the related need to decarbonize the economy, is forcing urgency for identifying the alternate source for the global adoption and sustainable scalable solutions. The country’s demographic and road patterns and its natural resources availability provide enormous scope for the electric bike industry. As per the “Navigant Research Report”, it is predicted that by 2018, the sales of electric vehicles in India will shoot up by 17 percent. 1.1 million electric vehicles will be targeted within next five years. A recent study on the environment impact of e-bikes with other forms of transportation found that e-bikes are about 18 times more energy consumption than SUV, 13 times than a sedan, 6 times more than rail transit, and it is having considered as an innovated conventional bicycle. It is a frugal innovation strategy which provide safe carbon free environment, and moreover a part of health rehabilitation programmes. It is required that societal, economic and political and infrastructure systems integrate together to balance the energy environment. With this potential, the era of electric bike started its new avenues on the roads of India specifically focusing on Indian women. To develop this viewpoint, the present study focuses on the preference of e-bike among the women in Madurai city. © 2015 The Authors. Published by VGTU Press.},

abstract={Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) of the retinal pigment epitheliumis involved in the pathogenesis of proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) that often leads to retinal detachment. In this study, Triphala, an ayurvedic formulation and two of its active ingredients, namely chebulagic acid and chebulinic acid were evaluated for anti-EMT properties based on in vitro experiments in human retinal pigment epithelial cell line (ARPE-19) under TGFβ1 induced conditions. ARPE-19 cells were treated with TGFβ1 alone or co-treated with various concentrations of aqueous extract (AqE) (30 - 300 μg/ml); alcoholic extract (AlE) (50 - 500 μg/ml) of triphala and the active principles chebulagic acid (CA) and chebulinic acid (CI) (CA,CI: 50 - 200 μM). The expression of EMT markers namely MMP-2, αSMA, vimentin and the tight junction protein ZO-1 were evaluated by qPCR, western blot and immunofluorescence. The functional implications of EMT, namelymigration and proliferation of cells were assessed by proliferation assay, scratch assay and transwell migration assay. AqE, AlE, CA and CI reduced the expression and activity ofMMP-2 at an ED50 value of 100 μg/ml, 50 μg/ml, 100 μM and 100 μM, respectively. At these concentrations, a significant down-regulation of the expression of αSMA, vimentin and up-regulation of the expression of ZO-1 altered by TGFβ1 were observed. These concentrations also inhibited proliferation and migration of ARPE-19 cells induced by TGFβ1. EMT was found to be induced in ARPE-19 cells, through SMAD-3 phosphorylation and it was inhibited by AqE, AlE, CA and CI. Further studies in experimental animals are required to attribute therapeutic potential of these extracts and their active compounds, as an adjuvant therapy in the disease management of PVR. © 2015 Sivasankar et al.},

abstract={l-Proline lithium bromide monohydrate (LPLBM), a promising semiorganic nonlinear optical material, was synthesized and single crystals of LPLBM were grown from solution by slow evaporation technique. Single crystal X-ray structure solution reveals that the grown crystal belongs to monoclinic system with space group P21. Presence of various functional groups was identified by FT-IR and FT-Raman spectral analyses. UV-Vis-NIR spectroscopic study shows that the LPLBM crystal possesses 90% of transmittance in the range of 250-1100 nm. Vickers microhardness values, the dielectric constant and dielectric loss of the LPLBM crystal were reported. Elemental analysis by energy dispersive X-ray analysis shows the presence of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and bromine. The surface morphology of the crystal was investigated using scanning electron microscopic study. The thermal stability of the LPLBM crystal was studied from TGA and DSC analysis. Second harmonic generation efficiency of the LPLBM crystal measured by Kurtz and Perry powder technique using Nd:YAG laser is about 0.3 times that of urea. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Objectives: The aims of the study were to evaluate the effects of a biosurfactant obtained from a novel Bacillus thuringiensis on Fusarium oxysporum to determine the morphological changes in the structure of the fungi and its biofilm in the presence of the biosurfactant and to evaluate the toxicity of the biosurfactant on HEp-2 human epithelial cell lines. Materials and methods: The strain was screened and isolated from petroleum contaminated soil based on the E24 emulsification index. The biosurfactant was produced on glycerol, extracted using chloroform:methanol system and purified using HPLC. The purified fraction showing both surface activity (emulsification and oil-spread activity) and anti-fusarial activity (agar well diffusion method) was studied using FT-IR and MALDI-TOF MS, respectively. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the biofilm inhibitory concentration (BIC) were determined using dilution method. The effect of biosurfactant on the morphology of Fusarium oxysporum was monitored using light microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy (for biofilm). Results: The purified surfactant showed the presence of functional groups like that of surfactin in the FT-IR spectra and MALDI-TOF MS estimated the molecular weight as 700. Da. The MIC and BIC were estimated to be 0.05 and 0.5. mg/mL, respectively. The molecule was also non-toxic to HEp-2 cell lines at 10× MIC. Conclusion: A non-toxic and effective anti-. Fusarium biosurfactant, that is both safe for human use and to the environment, has been characterized. The growth and metabolite production using glycerol (major byproduct of biodiesel and soap industries) also adds up to the efficiency and ecofriendly nature of this biosurfactant. © 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

abstract={Aim: To evaluate the impact of CYP2C9∗2 and CYP2C9∗3 variants on binding and hydroxylation of warfarin. Materials & methods: Multiple linear regression model of warfarin pharmacokinetics was developed from the dataset of patients (n = 199). Pymol based in silico models were developed for the genetic variants. Results: CYP2C9∗2 and CYP2C9∗3 variants exhibited high warfarin/7-hydroxywarfarin (multiple linear regression model), dose-dependent disruption of hydrogen bonds with warfarin, dose-dependent increase in the distance between C7 of S-warfarin and Fe-O of CYP2C9, dose-dependent decrease in the glide scores (in silico). Conclusion: CYP2C9∗2 and CYP2C9∗3 variants result in disruption of hydrogen bonding interactions with warfarin and longer distance between C7 and Fe-O thus impairing warfarin 7-hydroxylation due to lower binding affinity of warfarin.

abstract={Several ruthenium complexes are regarded as anticancer agents and considered as an alternative to the widely used platinum complexes. Owing to the preferential interaction of jacalin with tumor-associated T-antigen, we report the interaction of jacalin with four ruthenium complex namely, tris(1,10-phenanthroline)ruthenium(II)chloride, bis(1,10-phenanthroline)(N-[1,10]phenanthrolin-5-yl-pyrenylmethanimine)ruthenium(II)chloride, bis(1,10-phenanthroline)(dipyrido[3,2-a:2′,3′-c]-phenazine)ruthenium(II)chloride, bis(1,10-phenanthroline)(11-(9-acridinyl)dipyrido[3,2-a:2′,3′-c]phenazine)ruthenium(II) chloride. Fluorescence spectroscopic analysis revealed that the ruthenium complexes strongly quenched the intrinsic fluorescence of jacalin through a static quenching procedure, and a non-radiative energy transfer occurred within the molecules. Association constants obtained for the interaction of different ruthenium complexes with jacalin are in the order of 105 M-1, which is in the same range as those obtained for the interaction of lectin with carbohydrate and hydrophobic ligand. Each subunit of the tetrameric jacalin binds one ruthenium complex, and the stoichiometry is found to be unaffected by the presence of the specific sugar, galactose. In addition, agglutination activity of jacalin is largely unaffected by the presence of the ruthenium complexes, indicating that the binding sites for the carbohydrate and the ruthenium complexes are different. These results suggest that the development of lectin-ruthenium complex conjugate would be feasible to target malignant cells in chemo-therapeutics. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

This paper describes the solution for efficient lifetime. Battery management system is modeled by microcontroller to monitor and protect the battery pack. For safe working of the battery state of charge, SOC must be estimated. To improve the accuracy of the SOC, Kalman filter algorithm is implemented.

abstract={Schiff base is one of the easiest synthesizable chemosensor and exhibit strong coordination with metal ions; the property that has been vastly exploited for metal ions sensing. Simple Schiff base chemosensors (1a-d and 2a-d) were synthesized and demonstrated substitutional group dependent colorimetric sensing of metal ions. Chemosensor without (1a, 2a) and OCH3 substitution (1b, 2b) did not show any significant colour change for metal ions. However, a highly selective colorimetric change (colourless to pink) for Mn2+ ions (10-6 M) was observed with diethylamine substituted 1c, 2c. Hydroxyl substitution (1d, 2d) leads to selective colorimetric sensing (colourless to orange) of Fe3+ ions (10-6 M). PVA thin films of 2c/2d were fabricated and demonstrated selective colorimetric sensing of Mn2+ and Fe3+ ions. The practical applicability of the synthesized chemosensors were also demonstrated by performing selective colorimetric sensing of Mn2+ and Fe3+ ions in real samples such as tap, ground, pond and river water. Effect of substitution on the fluorescence selectivity of Zn2+ has also been investigated. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The transport properties of ZrN nanotube are studied in terms of band structure, density of states, electron density and transmission spectrum of ZrN nanotube. The band structure reveals that the nanostructures show metallic nature due to orbital overlapping of zirconium and nitrogen atoms. The density of states gives the information of localization of charges in energy intervals. The major contribution in density of states arises from p and d orbitals of zirconium and nitrogen atoms. The electron density is observed more in nitrogen sites for pristine and impurity substituted ZrN nanotube. The electrons near the Fermi level contributes more to the transmission, the impact in the transmission is seen due to substitution impurity and position of the defect in the ZrN nanotube. The results of the present work focus light to tailor ZrN nanotube with enhanced electronic properties in nanoelectronics applications. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Factor induced reprogramming of fibroblasts is an orchestrated but inefficient process. At the epigenetic level, it results in drastic chromatin changes to erase the existing somatic "memory" and to establish the pluripotent state. Accordingly, alterations of chromatin regulators including Ezh2 influence iPSC generation. While the role of individual transcription factors in resetting the chromatin landscape during iPSC generation is increasingly evident, their engagement with chromatin modulators remains to be elucidated. In the current study, we demonstrate that histone methyl transferase activity of Ezh2 is required for mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) during human iPSC generation. We show that the H3K27me3 activity favors induction of pluripotency by transcriptionally targeting the TGF-β signaling pathway. We also demonstrate that the Ezh2 negatively regulates the expression of pro-EMT miRNA's such as miR-23a locus during MET. Unique association of Ezh2 with c-Myc was required to silence the aforementioned circuitry. Collectively, our findings provide a mechanistic understanding by which Ezh2 restricts the somatic programme during early phase of cellular reprogramming and establish the importance of Ezh2 dependent H3K27me3 activity in transcriptional and miRNA modulation during human iPSC generation.},

abstract={A neural network based synchronous reference frame theory (SRF) control strategy is proposed in this paper to compensate power quality issues in three phase three wire (3P3W) distribution system through Unified Power Quality conditioner (UPQC) for various balanced/Unbalanced load and balanced/unbalanced/distorted source conditions. The ANN controller is designed to replace the Low pass filters and Proportional-integral controllers of the conventional control strategy for UPQC. Separate ANN controller is implemented to maintain voltage across the capacitor under all varying conditions of source and load. The Proposed control strategy mitigates harmonic/reactive currents, ensures balanced and sinusoidal source current from the supply mains that are nearly in phase with the supply voltage in spite of unbalance in the three phase load currents and source voltage conditions, in 3P3W distribution systems. The performance of the proposed ANN controller for UPQC is validated and investigated through simulations using MATLAB software. The simulation results prove the efficacy of the proposed neural network based control strategy under varying source and load conditions. © 2015 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.},

abstract={Steganography is the ability and science of enclosed or secreted writing. The idea of steganography is masked communication to hide the existence of a message from the interfering eyes. Digital Steganography algorithms have been developed by using text documents, image files and audio files as the cover media. This paper presents an approach for converting a secret message into a Text summary in Tamil language and that is transmitted over communication channel. The proposed method classifies the Tamil alphabets into four groups to hide secret data bits and it selects the sentence to generate a summary of the text, known as stego text. Similarly at the extraction end, the receiver extracts the characters from the stego text by following the groups and places the corresponding bits to get the secret message from the summary generated by the hiding process. This proposed method exhibits a satisfactory experimental result with the cover text chosen. © 2015 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.},

abstract={The phenolic and guest interacting functionality of N-(2-hydroxybenzyl)-isopropylamine (1) used for developing a silver nanoparticle (1-AgNP) based colorimetric sensor for metal cations (Ni2+, Co2+, Cd2+ and Ca2+) and oxalate and phosphate anions in aqueous solution. Interestingly, 1-AgNPs showed distinguishable colours for oxalate (dark grey), dihydrogen phosphate (light grey) and monohydrogen phosphate (orange). Ni2+ addition showed a clear wine-red colour whereas Co2+ showed pinkish colour. Cd2+ and Ca2+ addition resulted in orange colour formation. Absorption spectra of 1-AgNPs with metal cations and anions also exhibited selective change for metal cations (Ni2+, Co2+, Cd2+ and Ca2+) and oxalate and phosphate anions. HR-TEM studies indicate that aggregation of AgNPs due to selective metal coordination or anion interaction with surface functionality caused colour change. Differences in the aggregation led to different colours for metal cations and anions. 1-AgNPs exhibited a 10-6 M detection level for both cations and anions as well as high selectivity for Ni2+ and oxalate ions. Thus metal coordinating phenolic chelating ligands represent potential candidates for fabricating an AgNP colorimetric assay for metal cations and anions. © The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique 2015.},

abstract={Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are conjugated enzymes that modulate chromatin architecture by deacetylating lysine residues on the histone tails leading to transcriptional repression. Pharmacological interventions of these enzymes with small molecule inhibitors called Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) have shown enhanced acetylation of the genome and are hence emerging as potential targets at the clinic. Type-specific inhibition of Class II HDACs has shown enhanced therapeutic benefits against developmental and neurodegenerative disorders. However, the structural identity of class-specific isoforms limits the potential of their inhibitors in precise targeting of their enzymes. Diverse strategies have been implemented to recognise the features in HDAC enzymes which may help in identifying isoform specificity factors. This work attempts a computational approach that combines in silico docking and energy-optimised pharmacophore (E-pharmacophore) mapping of 18 known HDAC inhibitors and has identified structural variations that regulate their interactions against the six Class II HDAC enzymes considered for the study. This combined approach establishes that inhibitors possessing higher number of aromatic rings in different structural regions might function as potent inhibitors, while inhibitors with scarce ring structures might point to compromised potency. This would aid the rationale for chemical optimisation and design of isoform selective HDAC inhibitors with enhanced affinity and therapeutic efficiency. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cancer with 85% mortality rate in USA alone and it is prevalent in many other developed and developing countries. Clinically, gemcitabine is prescribed as the first line chemotherapeutic drug for pancreatic cancer treatment. Gemcitabine-loaded poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanospheres were synthesized and their physico-chemical properties were evaluated. The FESEM images showed that the gemcitabine loaded and blank nanospheres were 180 nm and 200 nm, respectively. The optimized encapsulation efficiency of gemcitabine was 15%. It was observed that 100% of gemcitabine was released from the PLGA nanospheres for 41 days in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.4. The uptake of nanospheres in MiaPaCa-2 cells was studied using sulforhodamine B loaded PLGA nanospheres and our results showed that the nanospheres were taken up within 3 h. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity of PLGA nanospheres loaded with gemcitabine showed a relative decrease in IC 50 in MiaPaCa-2 and ASPC-1 pancreatic cancer cells in comparison to free gemcitabine. The study demonstrates that this system hold promise to improve the therapeutic efficacy of gemcitabine in vitro. © 2014, Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The nanofluid was characterized through measurement of viscosity, particle size distribution and thermal conductivity. The interactions between Fe2O3 nanoparticles and propylene glycol on the nanoparticle surfaces lead to reduction in viscosity, the magnitude of which increases with nanoparticle concentration (0-2 vol%) at room temperature. The thermal conductivity enhancement for 2 vol% nanofluid was about 21% at room temperature, with liquid layering being the major contributor for thermal conductivity enhancement.

abstract={The control of HIV infection using antiretroviral agents, especially through targeted delivery, has attracted extensive attention in the last decade. Recently, the vaginal route of administration has become the one most recommended for HIV infections during pregnancy. Efavirenz is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor anti-HIV drug and its prolonged half-life helps achieve long-term preexposure prophylaxis of HIV-1 infections; it is used as a first-line drug in the treatment using combination therapy. Nanotechnology has received attention as a major area of research into drug delivery in recent years. The aerosol foam formulation is packed under pressure and contains therapeutically active ingredients that are released as foam on the activation of an appropriate valve system. The objective of this study was to develop an aerosol foam formulation of efavirenz nanoparticles for vaginal drug delivery. The nanoparticles were prepared using the emulsion solvent evaporation method and converted into an aerosol foam formulation with the addition of 0.1 mass % of sodium lauryl sulphate as a foaming agent and pressurised with 1,1,1,2-tetrafluroethane. The nanoparticles containing the formulation and aerosol foam formulation were individually characterised by applying various tests such as particle size, zeta potential, pH, viscosity, drug content, entrapment efficiency, drug release studies and release kinetics. The compatibility of the materials was evaluated using FT-IR, polymorphic changes by TGA-DSC and also the morphological properties using SEM study. Foam density, bubble size and collapse time were evaluated in the aerosol-foam formulation; in addition, the drug content and release studies were compared with nanoparticle formulation. The results revealed that the nanoparticle-containing formulation and aerosol formulations were stable and the foam emerged as grade one with fine bubbles and became coarser over time. © 2015 Institute of Chemistry, Slovak Academy of Sciences.},

abstract={Salt glands are specialized organelles present in the leaf tissues of halophytes, which impart salt-tolerance capability to the plant species. These glands are usually identified only by their morphology using conventional staining procedures coupled with optical microscopy. In this work, we have employed scanning electrochemical microscopy to identify the salt glands not only by their morphology but also by their salt excretion behavior. Bermuda grass (Cynodon dactylon L.) species was chosen for the study as they are known to be salt-tolerant and contain salt glands on leaf surfaces. Scanning electrochemical microscopy performed in sodium chloride medium in the presence and absence of potassium ferrocyanide as redox mediator, reveals the identity of salt glands. More insight into the ion expulsion behavior of these glands was obtained by mapping lateral and vertical variations in ion concentrations using surface impedance measurements which indicated five times higher resistance over the salt glands compared to the surrounding tissues and bulk solution. The protocol could be used to understand the developmental processes in plants grown in different soil/water conditions in order to improve salt tolerance of food crops by genetic engineering and hence improve their agricultural productivity. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In this paper, we discuss a systematic and self consistent procedure to factorize a rather general class of coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs), namely coupled quadratic and mixed Liénard type equations, which include various physical and mathematical models. The procedure is broadly divided into two parts. In the first part, we consider a general factorized form for the equation under consideration in terms of some unknown functions and identify the determining equations for them. In the second part, we systematically solve the determining equations and identify the compatible factorizing form for this class of equations. In addition, we also discuss the problem of identification of isochronous dynamical systems belonging to the above class of equations. In particular, we deduce an isochronicity condition for the coupled quadratic Liénard equation. We also present specific examples of physical interest. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={A series of functionalized malonic acid half-ester derivatives (parent compound MHE-1), with variations in functional groups at different positions on the aromatic ring, have been synthesized and crystal structures are determined at room temperature (296 K). The methyl (4-CH 3 , MHE-2) and chloro (4-Cl, MHE-3) derivatives are isomorphous with each other. The overall crystal packing of MHE-1-3 is similar. However, there are few differences observed between stacking of layers in these structures. Compounds with nitro (3-NO 2 , MHE-4) and ethyl ester (2-COOC 2 H 5 , MHE-5) substituents crystallize in different space groups and thus crystal packing is different when compared to MHE-1-3. In all the structures, intramolecular N-H⋯O and O-H⋯O hydrogen bonds generate a two fused S(6) ring motif. A detailed study is carried out to visualize intermolecular interactions observed in all five crystal structures (MHE-1-5) using Hirshfeld surface (HS) analysis with two dimensional fingerprint plots. The relative contribution of intermolecular H⋯H contacts in MHE-3 is substantially lower than that in MHE-1-2, though similar crystal packing arrangements of MHE-1-3 and MHE-2 and MHE-3 are isomorphous. From HS analysis it is clear that the observed H⋯H contact contribution (MHE-3) is a consequence of the presence of the chlorine substituent and growing contribution of Cl⋯H contacts. The relative contributions of other intermolecular contacts involving various atoms are comparable in MHE-1-3 structures. The intermolecular interaction energies are quantified using PIXEL for various molecular pairs extracted from respective crystal structures. Interestingly, there are some invariant and variable intermolecular contacts observed between different groups in all five structures. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.},

Fluorescence sensor studies of L-CdS QDs showed selective fluorescence switching (542-600 nm) for Cu2+ ions and quenching for Hg2+ ions in aqueous solution. High selectivity of L-CdS QDs for Cu2+ ions have been confirmed by interference studies. Interestingly, L-CdS QDs showed enhancement in the fluorescence intensity (4-fold) upon reducing pH from 2.0 to 10.0 without changing λmax. Importantly, selective fluorescent switching and quenching for Cu2+ and Hg2+ was observed from 2.0 to 10.0 pH range.

abstract={Effect of sputtering power on properties of CdO thin film deposited on glass substrate at room temperature by reactive dc magnetron sputtering has been studied. Correlation between the crystal structure, morphological and optical properties were systematically investigated. It has been found that sputtering power increases the crystallographic orientation of the film and at highest sputtering power, deterioration in crystallite growth occurs due to the excessively energetic sputtered particles. The microstructure of the films changes from nano flakes to self-assembled nano-pillar like structure with increasing sputtering power. All the films were highly transparent. The resistivity of the film decreased with increasing sputtering power and at 50 W, it increased to 16 × 10-2 Ω cm due to higher ion bombardment effects. The methane sensing properties has been demonstrated with the fabricated CdO based sensor at a relatively low operating temperature. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The influence of substrate temperature on the microstructural behavior, optical, electrical properties and on the scattering mechanism of charge carriers were studied for the as-prepared radio-frequency (R-F) magnetron sputtered Cadmium Tin Oxide (Cd2SnO4) thin films. Films prepared at the substrate temperature of 300 °C were found to be polycrystalline in nature with preferential orientation along (3 1 1) plane. Well pronounced Moss-Burstein shift, in the transmittance spectra with dispersions in the optical band gap from 3.07 to 3.30 eV, was observed at substrate temperatures between 25 and 300 °C. Optical property of high visible transmittance was retained by the films. Analysis of the electrical properties on the prepared crystalline Cd2SnO4 films showed a calculated resistivity of 10-3-10-4 Ω cm, with n-type carrier density in the range of 1019-1020 cm-3 and the charge carrier mobility in the range of 63-30 cm2/V s. The effects of structural, compositional and optical properties on the scattering mechanism of charge carrier are elaborated and reported to be an experimental evidence for the theoretical predictions. The results revealed the essential DC electrical conduction behavior, which is ideal for the fabrication of Cd2SnO4-based CdS/CdTe thin film solar cells. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={We consider the problem of removal of ordering ambiguity in position dependent mass quantum systems characterized by a generalized position dependent mass Hamiltonian which generalizes a number of Hermitian as well as non-Hermitian ordered forms of the Hamiltonian. We implement point canonical transformation method to map one-dimensional time-independent position dependent mass Schrödinger equation endowed with potentials onto constant mass counterparts which are considered to be exactly solvable. We observe that a class of mass functions and the corresponding potentials give rise to solutions that do not depend on any particular ordering, leading to the removal of ambiguity in it. In this case, it is imperative that the ordering is Hermitian. For non-Hermitian ordering, we show that the class of systems can also be exactly solvable and is also shown to be iso-spectral using suitable similarity transformations. We also discuss the normalization of the eigenfunctions obtained from both Hermitian and non-Hermitian orderings. We illustrate the technique with the quadratic Liénard type nonlinear oscillators, which admit position dependent mass Hamiltonians. © 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.},

abstract={Purpose: Dry eye is one of the suggested extrahepatic complications associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. HCV RNA has been detected from the tear fluid of patients with chronic HCV. There has been no literature evidence on the presence of HCV RNA in the tear fluid of patients with dry eye without HCV infection. In this study, tear fluid of patients with dry eye with no HCV infection was screened for the presence of HCV RNA.
Methods: Tear fluid was collected from patients with dry eye (n = 36) and healthy controls (n = 20). Real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to detect HCV RNA in the tear fluid. Anti-HCV enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, alkaline phosphatase, and alanine aminotransferase tests were performed in the serum samples collected from 15 patients with dry eye.
Results: Viral RNA was detected in 58.3% of the patients. Serum samples collected from 15 patients with dry eye were negative for anti-HCV. Alkaline phosphatase levels were elevated in 12 of 15 patients. Alanine aminotransferase levels were normal in all 15 patients. The odds ratio for the presence of HCV RNA in patients with dry eye was 22.4.
Conclusions: These results indicate a direct correlation between dry eye and HCV in non-HCV patients. Copyright © 2014 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.},

abstract={The spectrum allotted for communications has been distributed to various service providers, who maintain and manage their portion of the spectrum by accommodating as many users as possible through spectral management techniques. Static spectrum management has been replaced by dynamic spectrum management to meet the vastly increasing number of users. Although dynamic spectrum management techniques have enabled the efficient assignment of channels to the user, it has been statistically observed that a huge part of the communications spectrum is scarcely used at all times. Cognitive radio is a useful tool for efficient dynamic spectrum management. The cognitive radio is adaptive in nature and is most effective because of its ability to monitor the spectrum, sense the channel occupancy and mobilise the secondary user to an unused primary user channel, as well as to relocate the secondary user if the primary user wishes to communicate. In this work, the energy-detection method and the cyclostationary method, which are the methods to sense the spectrum, are analysed and the results are compared. Simulation is done using a LabVIEW tool (National Instruments, Bangalore, India) and finally the implementation is done on a Field Programmable Gate Array. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={The blood retinal barrier (BRB) can mitigate deleterious immune response. Dysfunction at the BRB can affect disease progression. Under inflammatory conditions Müller glia produce increased pro-inflammatory factors, like nitric oxide (NO). In this study we describe molecular events at the Müller glia during inflammation which could affect inner BRB properties. Griess assay and 4,5-diaminofluorescein diacetate (DAF-2DA) time-lapse fluorescence were used to measure NO production. Western blot was used to analyze the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) components. Lucifer Yellow was used to measure permeability. Griess assay and DAF-2DA time-lapse fluorescence images revealed that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced inflammation and increased NO production. In parallel, changes were observed in tight junction proteins, zona occludens 1 (ZO-1), connexin 43 (Cx43), and permeability. This was mediated through activation of iNOS and mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1), implicated in immune response. Endocannabinoids can exert a protective and anti-inflammatory effect. Exogenous arachidonoyl ethanolamide (AEA) inhibited NO generation and also abolished LPS-induced increase in permeability. Our work suggests that subtle changes in Müller glia function, which act as part of the BRB, could contribute to retinal health. AEA which can reduce inflammatory cytotoxicity has potential as treatment in several ocular manifestations where the integrity of the BRB is crucial. © 2014 IBRO.},

The band structure varies with oxygen substitution and defect in the GaN nanotube. The density of states spectrum provides the insight for the localization of charges in different energy intervals. The electron density is found to be more in nitrogen site than in gallium site across GaN nanotube. The substitution impurity has the influence over electron density along GaN nanotube. The transport properties are discussed in terms of transmission spectrum. The orbital delocalization gives rise to peak maximum in different energy intervals. The substitution effect of oxygen and defect in the structure has much impact in the transmission along the valence band and conduction band.

abstract={Slurry infiltrated fibrous concrete (SIFCON) can be considered as a special and advanced type of steel fibre reinforced concrete composite. SIFCON is produced by infiltrating a rich flowable cement slurry into the bed of preplaced fibres in the mould. The usage of rich mortar in production of SIFCON liberates excessive amount heat, which may cause shrinkage problems and lead to cracking. The cement is replaced with optimum quantity of fly ash in order to reduce the heat of hydration and to minimise the cracks which in turn improves the strength and durability characteristics of the composite. In this paper, an attempt has been made to investigate the mechanical properties of fly ash based SIFCON under normal and aggressive atmospheric conditions. An ordinary Portland cement was partially replaced by three different percentage of Class F fly ash (10%, 15% and 20%) in SIFCON slurries with incorporation of three different volume fraction of fibre content (2%, 4% and 6%). The test results indicated that the SIFCON specimen with 15% of FA and 6% of fibre content is found to be optimum both in normal and aggressive environmental conditions. Further, it is also found that the optimum mix yielded a compressive strength of 54.25 N/mm2 under normal atmospheric condition whereas the same is 47.5 N/mm2 under aggressive environment. It was also concluded that the incorporation of steel fibre content in the matrix developed the marginal increase in compressive strength. © Copyrights reserved with Sai Scientific Communications.},

abstract={This paper compares an implementation of solar photovoltaic (SPV) array and an isolated wind energy conversion system (IWEC) with improved linear sinusoidal tracer (ILST) based control strategy for a three phase three wire distribution static compensator (DSTATCOM). The proposed control strategy mitigates the power quality issues such as high reactive power burden, harmonics in current, load unbalancing and power factor improvement under nonlinear loads. The presented system implements maximum power point tracking (MPPT), feeding IWEC and SPV energy to the converter and mitigates the power quality problem in the distribution system. The SPV and IWEC systems act an energy buffer and are incorporated for three phase voltage source converter (VSC) to mitigate the power quality issues. In the proposed system DC link capacitor voltage is maintained constant by implementing MPPT. The ILST based control strategy is incorporated in SPV and IWEC power for fast dynamic response. The proposed system is simulated in MATLAB along with Simulink, embedded function and sim-power system toolboxes. The proposed control strategy is validated through MATLAB Simulink. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={The hydraulic network solver simulates the behavior of a water distribution network for a given set of geometric and hydraulic parameters, such as pipe length, pipe diameter, tank size, pump capacity, demand, and pipe roughness, etc. Over the years, many researchers have developed a number of hydraulic simulation models (software) for the analysis and design of water distribution networks, most of which are based on Demand Driven Analysis (DDA). This paper reviews the existing approaches and examines the usefulness of the emitter feature that is available in the hydraulic network solver (EPANET) as a tool for the pressure driven model. The emitter based method determines the possible supply at all deficient nodes, based on the availability of energy at that node by introduction of an emitter. This method, along with three existing approaches, has been applied to three benchmark networks, and important findings from the study, in terms of convergence and numerical results, are presented. The framework of the head-flow based approaches and the proposed method is carried out using the toolkit feature available in the EPANET hydraulic solver. © 2015 Sharif University of Technology.

abstract={Purpose: Sodium thiosulfate (STS) is clinically reported to be a promising drug in preventing nephrolithiasis. However, its mechanism of action remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the role of mitochondrial KATP channel in the renal protection mediated by STS. Materials and Methods: Nephrolithiasis was induced in Wistar rats by administrating 0.4% ethylene glycol (EG) along with 1% ammonium chloride for one week in drinking water followed by only 0.75% EG for two weeks. Treatment groups received STS, mitochondrial KATP channel opener and closer exclusively or in combination with STS for two weeks. Results: Animals treated with STS showed normal renal tissue architecture, supported by near normal serum creatinine, urea and ALP activity. Diazoxide (mitochondria KATP channel opening) treatment to the animal also showed normal renal tissue histology and improved serum chemistry. However, an opposite result was shown by glibenclamide (mitochondria KATP channel closer) treated rats. STS administered along with diazoxide negated the renal protection rendered by diazoxide alone, while it imparted protection to the glibenclamide treated rats, formulating a mitochondria modulated STS action. Conclusion: The present study confirmed that STS render renal protection not only through chelation and antioxidant effect but also by modulating the mitochondrial KATP channel for preventing urolithiasis.},

abstract={Application of artificial neural networks (ANN) in all possible fields is inevitable due to its robustness and simplicity over problem complexity. In this paper, an effort is made to apply ANN for the purpose of fitting and predicting the wear behaviour based on the criteria of various densification levels of molybdenum (2%Mo) alloyed powder metallurgy (P/M) low alloy steel (Fe-0.5%C). The various densities of sintered P/M low alloy steel specimens were subjected to dry sliding wear tests using pin-on-disc tribotester. The results of wear tests were compared, analysed and predicted by applying the ANN technique. It is observed that the ANN predicted values have good agreement with the experimental values. The wear properties of low alloy steel could be predicted on any input parameters level using ANN. The Mo addition has resulted in enhancing the wear resistive property of the plain carbon steel due to its carbides in the microstructure. © 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={Mining frequent pattern refers to the process of finding the frequently occurring item sets. Mining frequent item-sets within sliding window reduces the memory usage and the processing power. The algorithm used to mine data inside this closed window is Tmoment with the help of TCET(Transaction Translate Closed Enumeration Tree) data structure. Moreover, the support of a new frequent closed itemset is efficiently computed and an old pattern is removed. In this case when a frequent pattern does not occur for a short period of time, it will be eliminated from the window and hence mining should start from first, when the itemset occurs again. Hence in this proposed system, the concept of buffering is introduced to store the nodes which do not satisfy the minimum support count and also it is retained in the tree. This produces efficient mining results. Also the execution time of the proposed system is fairly comparable with the existing system. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Context: Ferulic acid (FA) is a potent ubiquitous plant antioxidant found in cereals such as brown rice, whole wheat, and oats. Phytochemical-based antioxidants are shown to be effective in neurodegenerative diseases. This study hypothesizes that supplementation of FA might combat oxidative stress-induced Parkinson’s disease (PD). Objective: To explore the effect of FA on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine hydrochloride (MPTP)-induced neurotoxicity. Materials and methods: Mice were randomized into five groups: Group I mice served as control. Group II mice received 5 × MPTP [25 mg/kg body weight (i.p.)] in saline 24 h apart starting from the 3rd day and continued till the last day of the experimental period of 7 d. In addition to MPTP injections, mice in Groups III, IV, and V were given FA at a dose of 20, 40, and 80 mg, respectively, for 7 d. Mice were subjected to a battery of behavioral tests along with histological investigations. Results: Our histological findings revealed that MPTP administration enhanced Bax/Bcl2 ratio and microglial cells activation reflecting induction of apoptosis and inflammation, respectively. This dopaminergic neuronal loss caused impairment in motor balance and coordination in MPTP mice as assessed by various behavioral tests. FA at a dose of 40 mg/kg/d body weight effectively attenuated MPTP-induced neurotoxicity. Discussion: Antioxidant, free-radical quenching, and anti-inflammatory activities of FA could contribute to its neuroprotective effect. Conclusion: This study provides elementary evidence for the neuroprotective action of FA against MPTP-induced PD in mice and warrants further studies. © 2015 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.},

Application of information technology has the potential to reduce the hassle involved in such processes. The paper aims to show the potential of reducing the hindrances and hassle involved in the adoption process. Currently, about 5000 orphaned children are adopted annually, which is paltry figure in comparison to the total number of orphans in orphanages and agencies across the country. The problem can be mainly attributed to long and cumbersome procedures involved in adoption process such as parent registration, background checks, and then finally finding the child that matches the couple’s preferences. The proposed work aims at reducing the time required to find a suitable child. Instead of manually finding a suitable orphan, a data mining based system employed on a centrally maintained data repository, can substantially reduce the time involved. It employs a modified version of Naïve Bayesian Classifier on the database to predict the possibility of child being adopted by a couple based on their preferences. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={The objective of data mining is to discover the hidden patterns and the trends in the input data. For this purpose it utilizes the large data sets that are available as part of data publishing. Data Privacy has to be ensured while extracting information from large data sets. In recent times achieving privacy in data mining plays a vital role. Data Perturbation can be used for generating the sanitized data from the original data. Most of the existing systems in the literature use a single noise value for the perturbation process. In this paper we propose an approach in which a random noise is added to original data for ensuring privacy. For generating random noise, pseudorandom number generators like linear congruential generator, RANDU and Inversive congruential generator are used. The modified data is now validated using K-means clustering algorithm. Then misclassification error is calculated and compared among the various methods.

abstract={The objective of this review article is to offer an insight into the performance issues pertinent to routing in Mobile Ad hoc Networks. This work has studied the approaches for solving the performance issues such as changes in topology, energy consumption of mobile nodes, delay, routing overhead, message delivery time, throughput, packet delivery ratio, security of networks and mobility management. To provide a perception of solutions for these issues, this study concentrates on various methodologies such as Effective Hierarchical Routing Algorithm, Link Stability with Energy Aware Multipath Routing protocol, Path Encounter Rate metric and Trust-based Source Routing protocol. Effective Hierarchical Routing Algorithm computes the route and has decreased the load of routing protocols. Link Stability with Energy Aware Multipath Routing protocol finds routes with small delay. Delivery ratio of packet in LSEA is improved on par with Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector Routing (AODV). Delivery ratio of packets in LSEA was enhanced by 40%. To get an efficient metric for routing in high mobility situations, Path Encounter Rate metric was proposed. Throughput achieved with this metric was 30% higher than those obtained by the hop-count metric. To choose a least-cost route with security constraints, TSR was proposed. TSR has improved the packet delivery ratio, ratio of identifying the malicious nodes as well as network throughput. This review of different methods can be used by researchers to find a better solution to these issues.},

abstract={In this paper, a three layer image cryptosystem for grayscale images is introduced to provide an efficient security for symmetric images. The proposed image encryption algorithm contains a 3D Arnold cap map for pixels' value shuffling and pixels' value substitution in the first layer. Followed by a Sudoku permutation layer which takes a Sudoku matrix and key as an input. The alternative block rotation mechanism is used to rotate the pixel values in the last layer. The confusion and diffusion properties of the 3D Arnold cat map together with Sudoku matrix and rotation provide good permutation and substitution for the image at each round. This proposed algorithm has a huge key space and has the desired secure cipher property. The security analysis is done in MATLAB, the simulation results demonstrates the robustness against differential attack models. The results conclude that the algorithm is best suitable for image encryption which requires efficient and fast encryption scheme.},

abstract={Image Segmentation is important task in computer vision. This paper discusses the various methods for segmentation. Most segmentation algorithms are developed for gray level images. These algorithms developed for gray level images can be applied to color images by modifying them to handle color images of by converting color images into gray level image. With the improvements in computing field color image segmentation has also gained momentum. But nevertheless gray scale image segmentation still predominantly used because of its ease in usage. This paper explores both gray level image segmentation and color image segmentation. The field images of theleaves were taken and different methods were tried the findings are recorded and discussed. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Dietary agents and phytochemicals have been utilised for the management of cancer for many years. Hesperetin, a dietary flavonoid found abundantly in citrus fruits, was evaluated for its cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic activities in A431 human skin carcinoma cells. Effect of hesperetin in regulating MAPK (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase) signalling pathway and levels of various cyclins and other downstream apoptotic proteins were investigated. Its critical role in regulating other apoptotic proteins especially p21, Bcl-2 and Bax were also assessed. Hesperetin stimulated alterations in MAPK (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase) signalling pathway by modulating the expression levels of ERK (Extracellular signal Regulated Kinase), JNK (c-Jun NH2-terminal Kinase) and p38; thereby induced apoptosis in A431 cells. Hesperetin regulated the levels of cyclin A2, B1, D1, D3 and E1. It also modulated the levels of various proteins involved in apoptotic pathway especially p21, Bcl-2 and Bax. The study revealed the efficiency of hesperetin against human skin carcinoma cells and proposed its mechanism of action; there by opens up new avenues for the use of this dietary flavonoid against skin malignancies. © 2015.},

For instance consider a video in which an eagle flying in one frame and after a few frames the same eagle changes its position. The motion of the eagle is predicted. Motion tracking is achieved by using linear interpolation technique. The video consists of hyperlinks and when clicked on the hyperlink it goes to the requisite frame rather than scanning through the entire video. The resulting video can be played from different positions corresponding to the original video. The most challenging part is the audio and video synchronization which is shown in the resulting video editor. The objective is to track multiple objects in a video and link different videos for each of the objects. © 2015, Research India Publications.},

abstract={Antiviral therapy requires desired intensity and duration of drug action at the site of infection to minimize adverse effects. The study aims to synthesize a nanoparticle based controlled release system for Acyclovir with required loading and maintenance doses to achieve steady-state plasma concentration for once-daily therapy. The amount of Acyclovir required for 24 h therapy was calculated to be 100 mg, which is approximately 10 fold reduced oral dose. Accordingly, nanoparticles with spherical and smooth surface were synthesized using hybrid polymer blends of polyvinyl pyrrolidone with ethyl cellulose or eudragit RSPO. Physical and chemical interactions between the drug and polymers favoured the formation of stable nanoparticles. Optimized nanoparticles with 80% entrapment exhibited size and surface charge of 100 nm and +26.1 mV respectively. In situ gels incorporated with 20% free drug and 80% Acyclovir loaded nanoparticles showed immediate sol-gel transition at 35°C-37°C with gel viscosity ranging between 1000 and 10 000 mPa s. The expected pH independent drug release profile was obtained in 0.1 N HCl, phosphate buffer, simulated vaginal and tear fluids. Ex vivo permeability was significantly higher through cornea than stomach and rectal membranes. Uptake of nanoparticles into human corneal epithelial cell lines was spontaneous. Foam spray was developed for optimized in situ gels for site specific action through vaginal or rectal administration. The bubble size, relative foam density, collapse time, drug content per puff and stability of the foam spray formulations proved its suitability for effective drug delivery. Hence, a unique dosage form achieving predicted release profile through diverse routes was well demonstrated. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.},

abstract={Image Segmentation is an effective technique which partition an image as essential regions or objects and the segmented regions are further used for computer vision process. This project provides an image segmentation approach to accurately detect boundary regions of agriculture fields in satellite image. Here image is first enhanced using contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization which divides the contextual regions and the histogram of an image equalized in every region. Spatial information of the image is obtained by edge detection method in order to neglect noises in the image while clustering. Then spatial information supplied to fuzzy c-means algorithm to cluster the image. The proposed approach uses spatial information to segment the satellite image which makes segmentation efficient Thus, the experimental result shows that, the proposed spatial clustering scheme, segment the images with efficient boundary detection and neglects incorrect clusters in the image. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Background/Objectives: This paper contains the change detection between frames of a video. The main objective is to show how the sequence of frames differ from one another in a video. Methods/Statistical Analysis: The amount of change between two frames is measured using the pixel based change detection parameter's Absolute Average Difference (AAD), Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Normalized Correlation (NC), Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and Mean Squared Error (MSE). These parameters detect the changes in each and every pixel of the frame with respect to other frame and values are calculated for each frame of a video and compared in the tables followed by analysis of the values. Findings: The results indicated the changes that are not perceived by the human eyes. They depict that if the change between two frames are visible to the human eyes then they differ more based on the parameter we have considered and if the change is not visible to the eyes then minute differences is observed between the two respective frames. Application/Improvements: The change detection plays a significant role in visual media. Based on the change detection of frames, analysis of a video can be done.},

The sputtered films were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and UV-Visible Spectroscopy to study the structural, morphological and optical properties. XRD results proved that the sputtered films were crystalline in nature with preferred (002) orientation and the crystallite size were increased. FE-SEM micrographs showed the films formed with spherical morphology. Upon increasing the sputtering power the transparency of the films increased from 75 to 99 % and the thickness of the films was increased from 171 to 187 nm.

Accuracy and effectiveness plays the key role for real time motion based applications. Raspberry pi processor is used to control the entire set up which has a camera module attached in it, to capture the motion. Face subtraction, skin color detections are used to characterize the hand in the video. Mean shift algorithm is used to track the motion of the finger. The mechanical structure and the ratio between number of actuators and number of Degrees Of Freedoms (DOFs) have been optimized in order to cope with the strict size and weight constraints that are typical application of artificial hands for the implication of humanoid robotics.

abstract={When outsourcing the data on to public cloud by data owner from mobile devices which are resource constrained a secure method of encryption model has to be used. As the mobile devices are resource constrained a trusted model is been deployed as an intermediate between mobile user and cloud service provider. The trusted model takes care of securely encrypting, Re-encrypting (upon the criticality of data) the data and uploading on to the cloud and then providing the data to the authenticated user upon his request. Different type of encryption techniques provide security for the data. The choice of encryption technique is made by comparative analysis between different attribute based encryption techniques like Cipher Policy based Encryption (CP-ABE), Location as a attribute encryption key policy based Encryption (KP-ABE). It is found to be the best to provide the required level of security for data outsourcing. The parameters that play a significant role in this technique is obtaining the current latitude and longitude position of the user who want to access the data. If the user is in authenticated location then access can be granted for the data. For this an android application has been developed and a trusted model with data base for storing the data, Re-encrypted data and secure keys for data security. The algorithm used for encrypting the data is RSA algorithm which is a public key encryption technique. If user wants to retrieve his data which is uploaded onto cloud he sends the filename to trusted model and he downloads the encrypted text from cloud, runs decryption algorithm and sends user data to user. If any exceptional case where user tries to access other user's data trusted model simply sends an error message to user who is trying to hack the data and trusted model intimates data owner regarding data hack and Mac-Id of device who is trying to hack. So we can confirm that data encryption is done based on Mac-Id of device.},

The analysis is repeated by replacing fixed supports with different soil conditions like cohesive and cohesion-less soil. Soil structure interaction effects due to earthquake excitation are observed. Four storey building models with total height of 17.5m were subjected to El Centro earthquake excitations, to obtain the response under different soil conditions. Time based responses are compared for structural members. Comparison of the results showed that stiffness of the soil greatly affects the displacements, forces and stresses in structural members. Response shows that unsymmetrical building found in cohesion-less soil is more vulnerable under earthquake excitations. © 2015 CAFET-INNOVA TECHNICAL SOCIETY. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Value of brand equity is proportional to the perceived risk from buying a product. When a consumer is attached with the purchase of a product emotionally or when the product is expensive, brand equity gains more significance. In the case of purchase of gold jewellery in the Indian conditions, the consumer adds more importance to the brand name and the brand equity attached to it. This study is unique in analysing the brand equity elements behind the purchase decision of Gold Plus gold jewellery with the help of predictive neural networks model. A study of the relative importance of the brand equity dimensions is not attempted in this study as there is rich literature on this subject. This paper identifies the significant brand equity elements which lead to the purchase decision of gold jewellery sold in India under the brand name of Gold Plus, a leading brand name in India. © 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={The unexploded landmines remain dangerous to the human community, if not swept post war. It causes long-term fatal issues to civilians in addition to rendering the land impassable and unusable for decades. The need of the hour is a reliable and suitable technology for identifying the accurate location of these landmines so that they can be demined with safety. The aim of designing this prototype is to develop an autonomous robot, which exploits its ability to detect and mark the landmines accurately with minimal rate of false alarms using efficient demining strategies. An effective plan for the path is provided for the movement of robot, considering the coverage of all critical points to detect mines so as to increase the efficiency. The differential steer drive dead reckoning method is used for determining the position and location of the robot. A user friendly GUI is developed, enabling the operator to control the robot, to plot the position of landmines and to monitor the scanned/left over area remotely. The key advantages of the developed model are its cost effectiveness, high sensitivity and reliability. © 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={Soft computing techniques are predominantly used in varied sectors of research for accurate prediction and optimisation. Recent advancements in artificial neural network (ANN) and its capability to predict the data have increased its range of applications including heat transfer problems. The present paper aims to predict base plate temperature of cross cut fins of variable height (5-15 mm), fin spacing (5.85-32 mm), number of crosscuts (0-5), heat duty (20-100 W) for constant fin thickness (3 mm) and base plate dimensions (180 × 250 mm). A neural network model is designed for a rectangular heat sink with cross cut fins. The model is developed using the data from numerical heat transfer calculation carried out in ANSYS FLUENT. The numerical model is validated with similar experimental results available in literature. The simulated data are used to train several neural-network configurations and the best neural-network model is used for prediction. The ANN model is used to predict the base plate temperatures of cross cut fins. The results reveal the ability of using ANN for accurate prediction of base plate temperature. © 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

The data which is available there provide an abundant wealth of information about user behaviour statistics and their potential is increasing, as it becomes common for images to be associated with location information in the form of geo-tags. To recommend tourist locations, there is an increasing tendency to adopt the information from these geo-tagged photos for learning. In this paper, we are going to propose a system procedure for recommending interesting tourist locations and tourist travel sequences (i.e., order of tourist locations) from a set of geotagged photos. Proposed system is capable of understanding context by taking into account the collective wisdom of people, to make tourist recommendations as well as considering real time parameters (i.e., time, date, and weather). We illustrate our technique on a sample of public Flickr data set. The results of experiment demonstrate that this approach is able to produce better recommendations as compared to other fore-front landmark based advocacy methods. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={In this paper we have proposed an energy efficient cryptosystem using enhanced Hill Cipher algorithm with an involutory key. In Hill Cipher, inverse of the matrix is required at the decryption side. In fact that, not all the matrices have inverse. If the matrix is not invertible, then the cipher text cannot be decrypted. In 2007, Acharya introduced Self Invertible matrix method to overcome that problem. Consequently, many research papers were published based on Self Invertible matrix that can take account of only positive integers and not negative numbers. This paper suggests that the same non singular key matrix can be used at the encryption and decryption end. Consequently at the time of decryption inverse of the key matrix is not essential. The key matrix can include both positive and negative numbers. Furthermore, this proposed method get rid of the computational complexity concerned in finding the inverse of the matrix while decryption. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={In the present work, TiO2 nanotube length is optimized using artificial neural network. The length of TiO2 nanotube can be varied with the parameters such as applied voltage and anodization time inanodization of Ti foil method. Various range of tube length from 0.400-10.998μm can be grown when voltage is kept at 10V and the anodization time is adjusted from 1-45 hours. The tube length of 0.400-11μm can be synthesized, when the voltage is kept at 20 V and the anodization time is adjusted from 1-70 hours. The computed results of the tube length are found to be in close agreement with the experimental results with an error of 0.00403.

Various applications like wildlife monitoring, video surveillance, traffic monitoring, and license plate recognition are done using either image or video processing by a camera unit. In Wireless multimedia Sensor Networks (WMSN), each node has camera module and communication is done via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or radio frequency module. In the proposed work, detection of human in unmannered area using WMSN with low cost and energy utilization is the foremost goal. The vicinity to be monitored is alienated into M×N grids based on both sensor and camera coverage. The Passive Infrared sensor (PIR) sensor is meant for human movement discovery and a controller unit has a camera module along with driver circuit in the center of each grid. If activity is detected, the camera module receives command from its controller, it will turn to event detected area and turn ON the camera and start to capture the video and transmit using Zigbee. The monitoring location on receiving the video generates an alert beep signal and indicates the arrival of the video. The acknowledged video can be stored and processed for further process. The object detection done by PIR sensor and tracking is done by rotatable camera. The hardware setup is implemented and the results are shown using PC. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Objective: The main objective of the paper is to enhance the security of the images using three different wavelet while transmission of the images. Method: In the Existing system, images are directly encrypted using HAAR wavelet which provides frequency sub bands and they are exchanged in single level deliberately. Hence, it is prone to guess the wavelet and can be applied to detect the process to retrieve the original image. In our proposed work, three different wavelets are used to encrypt the image along with a password. The main advantage of the method is to enhance the security level in encryption process. Result: A password will be assigned to the image a key will be generated through the password using a key generation algorithm. Key is used to select the wavelet mechanism and two levels of frequency sub band exchange process will be carried out to ensure the security of the image. The originality of the image is compared through their PSNR Values. There will be no loss of data in the process is an additional advantage of our proposed work. Conclusion: Thus the original image is retrieved in the process and the method is highly secure for transmitting the image. Only intended users can retrieve the original image by using password.},

abstract={Background: Blood vessel tortuosity analysis in fundus image is used to develop a Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) to diagnose hypertensive retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, cardiovascular problem and stroke. Methods: A Novel approach using machine learning algorithms has been proposed in this paper to determine global tortuosity in a clinical perspective. After preprocessing and blood vessel extraction, eight dimensional feature vector is formed by evaluating tortuosity. By applying Correlation based feature selection procedure top four features are selected for classification purpose. We have collected images from database and hospital, and images are graded by senior ophthalmologist under two labels namely normal and tortuous image. Findings: Highest sensitivity is obtained in the case of SVM classifier. By keeping clinical classification as ground truth highest sensitivity of 96.6% is achieved in case of SVM with radial basis function as kernel. Feature selection process improves the overall sensitivity by 4% and also reduces the computational complexity. In the proposed method decision making is done based on the four features followed by classification, which outperform the other methods in the literature. By using the novel feature-classifier combination, highest sensitivity is obtained. Improvement: In the proposed method decision making is done based on the four features, which outperform the other method proposed in the literature. By using the novel feature-classifier combination, highest sensitivity is obtained.},

abstract={The existing scenario to store a large amount of data in a centralized server is complex as the information stored is immense. To avert this organizations move to cloud this causes some security issues. The paper focuses on ABBE (Attribute Based Broadcast Encryption) which is an enhancement of ABE (Attribute Based Encryption) which uses ABE to encrypt the data (AES key) and then broadcasts the cipher in order to provide fine grained access. This also avoids collusion and excess key generation. In addition to this multiple data owner scenario scheme is part of our proposal wherein the whole system is divided into multiple domains. AES encryption is used to encrypt data and ABBE to encrypt the AES key to be broadcasted. ABBE has minimized implementation complexity and less effort with respect to computation when compared to that of ABE. This imposes no limit on the attribute's size, when those attributes sets are used for encryption and has a huge attribute universe. Also the cost of cryptographic functions like encryption and decryption is minimum. It also enables modification of accessibility or modification of attributes dynamically and also it supports effective user or attribute revocation as per the demand. By having multiple domains the management complexity of keys is also minimum. This novel framework is developed for educational institutions to securely share the information through cloud.},

abstract={Background/Objectives: The main objective of this project is to identify and overcome those frequently occurring cloud computing failures and in turn maintaining the integrity of the system. Methods/Statistical analysis: Nowadays, predominantly existing failures are component failure, network failure and security issues. A practical problem is considered, that occurs frequently in our system, and the results also confirm that the downtime can be shortened even if failure occurs. In this paper a new mechanism is introduced namely CFTM (Collaborative Fault Tolerant Mechanism) to overcome these failures in the cloud environment. Results: The CFTM provides with authentication to the users who upload their data into the cloud. By fragmenting and replicating them into the virtual storages, there is least chance of data loss in the server end even when there is a system component failure in the server side that will result in the data that are stored. Therefore, the CFTM (Collaborative Fault Tolerant Mechanism) provides the user with reliability, availability and throughput. Collaboration of authentication and data recovery is the key feature of CFTM. It makes sure that the integrity, reliability and the scalability of the data that the user handles over the cloud server are enhanced and maintained. The CFTM works greatly on a smaller scale meaning that it will deal with systems that are under a smaller sized network. Since the mechanism revolves around basic techniques of computing, this mechanism can be applied to any bigger network. Conclusion/Application: The Collaborative Fault Tolerance Mechanism is a successful mini scale fault tolerance mechanism that provides effective cloud service to the user. CFTM can be applied to any cloud related system.},

abstract={Cross media retrieval plays a vital role in finding semantic consistency among the data that are represented through different media. A framework is proposed for this process that starts with Isomorphic Relevant Redundant Transformation (IRRT), which linearly transforms different heterogeneous low-level feature spaces to a high-level redundant feature-isomorphic space without any dimensionality reduction, i.e., without data loss. Then, transforming these data with same dimensionality, with the help of Convex relaxed Alternating Structure Optimization (cASO). Consequently, the SCP for cross-view data can be obtained. On comparing the frameworks using MAP score by keeping Normalized correlation as the distance metric, it is confirmed that the proposed framework forms the better classifier system than the existing framework. So the proposed effective framework has its broad applications in the field of the information retrieval system that works on cross view data.},

The thickness of spray deposited ZnO film depends on various parameters mainly it depends on concentration of precursor, substrate temperature and time of deposition. In the present work, the three important parameters are estimated in order to obtain a film of particular thickness. Moreover, the characteristics of ZnO film are influenced by the thickness. In order to estimate ZnO film thickness the given data are trained with an accuracy of about 0.002 percent. The film thickness of spray deposited ZnO around 100nm – 500nm can be obtained in lower molar concentration in the range of 0.15M – 0.4M with increasing the temperature and deposition time duration.

abstract={Treatment for metastatic breast cancer still remains to be a challenge since the currently available diagnostic and treatment strategies fail to detect the micro-metastasis resulting in higher mortality rate. Moreover, the lack of specificity to target circulating tumor cells is also a factor. In addition, currently available imaging modalities to identify the secondaries vary with respect to various metastatic anatomic areas and size of the tumor. The drawbacks associated with the existing clinical management of the metastatic breast cancer demands the requirement of multifunctional nanotheranostics, which could diagnose at macro- and microscopic level, target the solid as well as circulating tumor cells and control further progression with the simultaneous evaluation of treatment response in a single platform. However, without the understanding of the biology as well as preferential homing ability of circulating tumor cells at distant organs, it is quite impossible to address the existing challenges in the present diagnostics and therapeutics against the breast cancer metastasis. Hence this review outlines the severity of the problem, basic biology and organ specificity with the sequential steps for the secondary progression of disease followed by the various mechanistic approaches in diagnosis and therapy at different stages. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={In India, Gold is a preferred asset for its liquidity and appreciation in value. It can also be used against inflation and this glittering metal provides stable returns and easy marketability to the investors. Though conventional investment options like jewellery, gold bars and coins still exist, the people also prefer GETF. Gold Exchange Traded Funds (GETF) is another effective way to invest in the yellow metal and it is safest investment than all others. Primary data were collected from the investors who are already trading in equity shares and Gold ETFs and the secondary data were collected from NSE website for ranking the companies based on their NAVs and offers gold exchange traded fund (GETF). The investors’ behaviour on GETF is analysed by using tools like percentage analysis and Chi – Square Test. The study has also focused on the risk associated with return based on the Beta value and risk measuring tools like Sharpe ratio, Treynor ratio and Jensen – Alpha Measure. From the analysis, it is found that the investors are willing to purchase gold in the form of jewels, gold bars and others from retailers only, even though they are not much aware about the purity and other risks involved in the same. When purchasing gold in the form of jewels, gold bars, the investors may lose their value for money at the time of purchase and also during exchange. The investors who invest their money in gold for their future purposes are willing to invest in GETF. Finally, it is concluded that the investors may invest in GETF for their additional investment with the mutual fund companies which offers this type scheme by creating proper awareness about GETF to the investors © 2015, Journal of Applied Economic Sciences.

To overcome these complications, the sensor network should be autonomous in nature and it should be able to rectify in case of failures. In this paper, a fusion algorithm based on the battery power model and sensor failure detection algorithm is proposed. The battery power model algorithm is used to detect and alarm the information about the nodes with low battery power to a monitoring node. Thus, node failure due to battery drain can be prevented. The sensor failure detection algorithm is used to sense false sensor readings using a non-linear function minimization and the system failure can be eliminated. The hardware for the above mentioned system is designed and is targeted to AT89C51.

abstract={In the present study, an attempt has been made to study the effect of weld parameters on as-cast Al-SiC metal matrix composite plates using a newly developed active flux composition. Stir cast Al - 8% SiC plates were welded using different variants of TIG welding such as Constant Current TIG (CCTIG) welding, Pulsed Current TIG (PCTIG) welding, activated TIG (ATIG) welding and Pulsed Current Activated TIG (PCATIG) welding. Microstructure, macro structure, thermal profile, micro hardness and tensile properties were evaluated for different variants of TIG welding conditions and compared with each other. The combined effect of the active flux composition and pulsed current in PCATIG welding was compared with other variants such as TIG welding technique such as CCTIG welding, ATIG welding and PCTIG welding. Thermal profile revealed the increase in the peak temperature and the cooling rates for the PC-A-TIG weldments. Due to increased cooling rate, fine grain microstructure was observed in weld zone and heat affected zone. Fine grain microstructure of the PCATIG weldment is responsible for improved mechanical properties such as micro hardness, ultimate tensile strength, yield strength and elongation (%) compared to other welding variants. Maximum micro hardness value was found in weld zone in all the variants of TIG welding. PCATIG welding showed maximum weld zone hardness as 75HV, heat affected zone hardness values of the all TIG welding variants have more or less same value after 4mm away from weld centre. Due to active flux coating on PCATIG welding lead to increase in weld depth as 4.5mm. This increase in the weld depth directly increase the depth-towidth ratio (D/W = 0.82). Tensile strength of PCATIG welded sample showed (Ultimate Tensile Strength = 153MPa; Yield Strength = 137 MPa; elongation (%) = 16%). It confirms that the Al-SiC composite welded using PCATIG welding were improved mechanical behaviour than other TIG welding variants such as CCTIG welding, ATIG welding and PCTIG welding.},

abstract={In a simple and conceptually designed method for the dehydration of fructose on a solid support, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) was synthesized in more than 95% isolated yield from fructose under very mild conditions at room temperature. The loading of fructose on the solid support reduced the intermolecular interactions between fructose/intermediates, diminished the formation of polymeric material (humin) and increased the selectivity towards HMF formation.

abstract={In the electronics world a good number of the circuits use inductor. But, its implementation at near to the ground frequencies is narrowed due to enormous number of turns required to wound on the coil. This also in turn takes up vast space and makes fabrication difficult. It is not attuned with the most recent Integrated Circuit fabrication technology. Normally the inductors have some loses and its effect is reflected in terms of poor quality factor. Here in this paper a new way of implementing the inductor is discussed. It uses the negative R concept to cancel the positive R to realize an inductor with no loss. Few applications are shown and the response highly coincides with the theory. © 2006-2015 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).},

abstract={Graph coloring is a classical NP-Complete combinatorial optimization problem and it is widely applied in different engineering applications. This paper explores the effectiveness of applying heuristics and recursive backtracking strategy to solve the coloring assignment of a graph G. The proposed method applies heuristics through recursive backtracking to obtain the approximate solution to χ(G), the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of G. The proposed heuristics splits V(G) into higher degree and lower degree vertices such that the search space is reduced when calling the recursive backtracking algorithm for higher degree vertices first. The performance of this approximation method is evaluated using some well known benchmark graphs, and the results are found to be proficient. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Objectives: This study was aimed to investigate the phytochemical constituents, antioxidant activity and hepatoprotective activity of Asteracantha longifolia leaf extract. Methods: Hepatotoxicity was induced in normal albino rats. Carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) was administered orally at a dosage of 20 mg/kg body weight in physiological saline for 1 day. Group 1 served as Control. Group 2 served as disease control (CCl4 20 mg/kg body weight). Group 3 served as animal treated with the aqueous extract A. longifolia (150 mg/kg body weight orally administered for 15 days). Group 4 served as animal treated with the aqueous extract A. longifolia (300 mg/kg body weight orally administered for 15 days). Group 5 served as animal treated with standard silymarin drug (20 mg/kg body weight orally administered for 15 days). After completed the experiment, the liver markers, lipid profile, and antioxidants were analyzed. Results: Phytochemical screening of aqueous extract of A. longifolia leaves indicates the presence of flavonoids, tannins, glycosides, phenol, steroids, alkaloids, quinone, saponin, and coumarin. Supplementation of A. longifolia significantly restored the liver markers, lipid profile, and antioxidant markers on in CCl4 induced Wistar albino rats. Conclusions: The results of our study showed that A. longifolia possess significant hepatoprotective and antioxidant activity, probably due to its phytochemicals. © 2015, Asian Journal of Pharmaceutical and Clinical Research.

This paper proposes a new smoothing method to diminish an unwanted consequence which is present in the group of pixel. First, extract the patches from the input underwater image. Impose different noises to the extracted patches and replace it in its original position. The corrupted image gets converted into a signal. The signal is given as an input to the recursive least-square filter which removes the noise and produces a smooth signal. The smooth signal is converted into a smooth image. Finally, Peak-signal-to-noise ratio is calculated by adding discrete levels of noise in an extracted patch which measures the quality of an image. © 2015 Research India Publications.},

abstract={The evolutionary algorithms performance on NP-hard optimization problems are strongly depend on how the evolutionary population breaks the symmetry of the solution search space by avoiding the local optimum. To reduce the computational complexity of crossovers and to achieve more suboptimal solutions in the population, the symmetry of the population should be eliminated using right strategy. Graph Coloring is a NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem which takes high symmetric population in the solution space and it is applied in engineering domains. This paper exhibits the strength of genetic algorithm in solving graph coloring through symmetry-breaking approach in evolutionary optimization. In general the population-based methods are not yielding fine offspring during the recombination of fine offspring chosen from different parts in the search space. The proposed genetic algorithm employs an n-point crossover and mutation operators. Since the population based approaches allow large jumps in the search space it is necessary to break the symmetries in the population. This paper focuses on breaking the symmetries in the population by applying the cyclic permutations based on the continuous probability distribution in the gene sequences so that solution search space is minimized to obtain the near optimal convergence of graph coloring problem. The performance of this approximation method is simulated on some of the benchmark graphs and the results are presented. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Objective: Flux balance analysis is one method to analyse genome-scale models for metabolism and transcriptional regulation. Her we use the apoptotic pathway, the most widely used FBA to perform a mathematical model also analyses the flux balance to study the relationship between the flux and the genes involved in the extrinsic pathway. Methods: KEGG was used to obtain information of pathways and related ligands and genes. Biocyc was considered for its intricacy in explanation of the mechanisms of pathways. A specific wing of Biocyc called humancyc was used for human related pathways. SBML was used to sort the several pathways. Results: The pathway was modelled using SBML version 2 level 1 specifications which are the most commonly used version making FBA one of the best methods for studying this process. Based on FBA, the genes like bid and cyc were classified as essential and non-essential. All these details suggest that our model is sensible scientifically. This technique can satisfy researchers to uncover several biologically complex pathways computationally. This is a more efficient and less time consuming process. Conclusion: With the availability of experimental biochemical data, like the concentration or the ratio of these caspases in a cell, the accuracy of this method can be improved. In our method, the entire model is considered to be present in a single compartment. Separate compartments for the inclusion of inhibitors and activators can be added to represent the pathway more effectively. A more complex model including the entire apoptotic pathway can be modelled to determine all possible ways of inhibiting apoptosis. © 2015, International Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Science.

abstract={Obective: To evaluate the biological significance of silver nanoparticles synthesized by aqueous root of Desmodium gangeticum and to understand its antioxidant, antimicrobial and cytotoxic activity. Methods: In the present study silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were synthesized with precursor silver nitrate using aqueous root extract of Desmodium gangeticum (DG). Chemical synthesis of AgNPs was done by following the procedure by Guzman et. al (2009) with little modification. The AgNPs were further characterized by different techniques like UV-visible Spectrometer, X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infra-Red spectroscopy (FTIR), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Thermo Gravimetric Analysis (TGA). Results: The presence of silver nanoparticles with an average size between 30-40 nm and exhibiting face centred cubic structure was confirmed. SEM reveals the morphology of the nanoparticles as spherical and the IR spectra confirms the presence of phyto-constituents in AgNPs that not only acts as reducing agent, but also stabilize the particles. Biological evaluation of the nanoparticles showed significant antimicrobial and antioxidant activity. AgNPs possess relatively low cytotoxicity to LLC-PK1 cells compared to DG extract and the precursor silver nitrate. Conclusion: Biological evaluation of the nanoparticles showed significant antimicrobial and antioxidant activity. AgNPs possess relatively low cytotoxicity to LLC-PK1 cells compared to DG extract and the precursor silver nitrate.

Methods: The antimicrobial (cell-density) and anti-virulent (swarming motility, protein, protease, hemolysis, hemagglutination, hydrophobicity and biofilm inhibition) properties of the Meliadubia stem extracts were performed. Results: The biofilm, hemolysis, swarming motility were inhibited by 45.71%, 12.97 % and 33.33% respectively when the media were supplemented with 30 mg/ml of ethanolic extract. The GC-MS spectrum of ethanolic extract showed an array of 49 structurally unrelated compounds with the natural ligand, AHL. Their interaction with the quorum regulator, SdiA, was predicted by Glide module of Schrödinger suite and the ligands C 7, C 20, C 28 showed appreciable activity with the following G-Score 11.4, 10.7, 9.9 respectively. In vitro and in silico molecular docking analysis data showed fairly good correlation, suggesting that the ethanolic extract has the potential to attenuate the quorum sensing of UPEC. Further investigation is desired to study the antagonistic effect of the above ligand by in vitro and in vivo strategies.

abstract={Eugenol (1-allyl-4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzene) is the phenolic component of essential oil and the main constituent of Eugenia caryophyllata, Ocimmum gratissimum and several others medicinal plant. In view of its non-mutagenic and non-carcinogenic properties, eugenol is generally regarded as safe by the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations. Eugenol has been recently shown to be effective for antimicrobials and treatment of different life threatening diseases including sepsis, leishmaniasis, and cancer. However, overall, activity of eugenol is not discussed elsewhere. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of the mechanisms involved the antioxidant, antimicrobial, anticancer and anti-inflammatory potential of eugenol. © 2015, International Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Science.

abstract={Objectives: Metal oxide nanoparticles have been widely explored in various applications like biosensors, solar cells, biomedical applications in the recent times. However, biological applications of these nanoparticles needs to be low compatible and this is often found as a limitation. The present study aims to compare CuO nanoparticles prepared by chemical and green route to evaluate its suitability for biological applications. Methods: CuO nanoparticles prepared by both methods were characterized by using XRD, UV-Visible spectroscopy, FTIR, ZETA for phase structure, size, the functional group presence, thermal stability and surface charge stability respectively. Free radical scavenging potential and phenolic contents, was assessed for biologically prepared CuO nanoparticles. Results: Green synthesized CuO nanoparticles were found to have higher free radical scavenging potential with good colloidal stability and was also found to have well defined monodisperse nature as compared to chemically synthesized CuO nanoparticles. Evaluation of toxicity in cell line LLC PK1 was found to be slightly toxic. Conclusion: Green synthesized CuO nanoparticles was found to have good stability when compared to chemically synthesized ones showing that they possess desired attributes to be used for biomedical applications. © 2015, International Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Science.

abstract={Objective: Magnetic Iron oxide nanoparticles (IONP) are of potential use in the field of biomedical, bioengineering particularly in vivo applications like tissue repair, drug delivery. However, biocompatibility of the nanoparticles is of great concern. Hence in this manuscript, we compare suitability using IONP prepared by two different routes namely chemical and green, for the biological applications. Methods: In the green route, Desmodium gangeticum root extract was used as the reducing agent with no specific capping agent for the synthesis of nanoparticles unlike chemical route, where propylene glycol was used. The synthesised nanoparticles were characterized and compared by UV-Vis spectrophotometry, X-ray Diffractometry (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Zeta analyser and Vibrating Sample Magnetometry (VSM). Results: The results were similar except for that the size of green synthesised IONP was reduced and possesses even distribution (i.e. mono dispersed). Biological activity, as assessed by its free-radical scavenging potential and anti-microbial effect was found to be better in the case of green IONP. Toxicity studies using LLC-PK1 cell line shows relatively low toxicity of green synthesised nanoparticles. Conclusion: Biologically synthesized IONPshow significant antioxidant effect,retains magnetic behaviour and found to be less toxic, therby proving its compatible nature as required in biomedical applications. © 2015, International Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Science.

The strength properties viz., compressive strength, and splitting tensile strength are studied. The strength development for various percentages of bottom ash (30% - 50%) with a constant 20 percentage of marine sand (as replacement for fine aggregates) are equated to the strength development of normal concrete at different ages of concrete namely 3 days, 7 days and 28 days. Even though the strength development is less for bottom ash concrete, it can be equated to lower grade of normal concrete. © 2015, Sphinx Knowledge House. All rights reserved.},

The measurements of transport properties of ceria-ethylene glycol nanofluids reveal viscosity reduction and thermal conductivity enhancement over a range of nanoparticle concentration (0-1 vol%) and temperature. The well-dispersed nanoparticles interact with ethylene glycol, perturbing the intermolecular hydrogen bonds in ethylene glycol, leading to decrease in viscosity. The liquid layering on well-dispersed crystalline ceria nanoparticles contributes to temperature-dependent thermal conductivity with ~17% and 10.7% enhancement for 1 vol% nanofluid at 10 °C and 30 °C respectively. © 2014 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers.},

abstract={Intermolecular β-strands are common in natural protein oligomers; but the pathologic and designed forms triggers the aggregation through the non-native self assembly of misfolded proteins, suggest that natural β proteins would be designed to avoid aggregation or misfolding. In particular, self assembly of misfolded proteins is the hallmarks of several neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, ALS etc. Interestingly, interfaces of natural β-strand self-assemblies allow accurate definition and the perfect orientation of subunits relative to one another, which is important for designing β-structured material with good accuracy. To understand how the natural β structure interfaces are designed to avoid aggregation, here we systematically studied the different parameters at the interface regions such as hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, disulphide bridges, solvation free energy gain upon interface, residue'residue contacts and the physicochemical, structural and energetic properties of interface amino acids. Our study reveals that the naturally existing β-interfaces have different mechanisms, to maintain the functional assembly, based on the individual folds and superfamily. This preliminary analysis aimed to generalize the strategies of various protein interfaces based on statistical analysis, which can provide better understanding on protein aggregation and help to design stable mutants. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.},

abstract={The proposed work delineates the chemometric analysis of the developed ceria-polyaniline (CeO2- PANI) core shell nano-interface based carbonic anhydrase electrochemical biosensor for the detection of carbonic acid in human blood samples. The statistical methods inter-correlate the electrochemical parameters such as the amount of charge consumed (Q), electron transfer rate constant (Ks), cathodic peak current (Ipc), surface coverage, full width at half maximum of cathodic peak height (FWHM) with the added carbonic acid concentrations (S) to the 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4. Principal component and hierarchical cluster analysis show that FWHM and Ipc are influenced by S, whereas Q although being related to the substrate are not significantly influenced and Ks is independent of S. The linear regression, the higher-order polynomial and the nonlinear regression fits of current are single parameter dependent and they generally predict the carbonic acid concentrations with error. In this work, multiple linear regression model provides an equation for the estimation of carbonic acid concentration from the parameters FWHM and Ipc. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.},

abstract={Data governs the present world. Data mining has become a vital tool among many industries and organizations for effective decision making. Data mining involves extracting patterns from large data sets to form an understandable structure for future use. In recent years, sharing of data between organizations has taken place for their development. Even though sharing of data has an advantage, data which contains sensitive attributes pose a threat of exposing private information. Thus privacy of the sensitive attributes is of a greater concern. This work aims at preserving privacy of sensitive attributes by using two modified cryptographic techniques namely, Rail Fence and Vigenere Cipher algorithms. The unique feature of this approach is that the encryption matrix is formed from the original data itself. The modified data is generated based on this key matrix. From our experimental results it is evident that the original data cannot be inferred from the modified data. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Peripheral nerve injuries have several clinical implications and immense potential for exploring the strategies for repair and regeneration of the nerve. Electrospun nanofibers are attractive candidates for neural regeneration applications due to ease of controlling their physico-chemical properties and their structural similarity to the extra-cellular matrix. Self-assembling peptide nanofiber scaffolds (SAPNFs) like RADA16, designer SAPs with functional motifs RADA16-I-BMHP1 have shown promise in spinal cord regeneration. In this study, we have developed a novel hybrid scaffold made of PLGA electrospun nanofibers decorated with RADA16-I-BMHP1 SAPs to provide both the topographical cues and biorecognition motifs. The scaffolds were characterized for the presence of peptides both qualitatively and quantitatively. The Schwann cell adhesion, proliferation and gene expression levels on the scaffolds were evaluated and the results demonstrated significant effects of the peptide coated PLGA scaffolds over the PLGA scaffolds on promoting Schwann cell proliferation and gene expression levels. Hence, our results demonstrate that the designed hybrid scaffold can be employed as a potential scaffold for peripheral nerve tissue engineering. © 2015 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={Hyperbranched polyethylenimine (HPEI), an amine rich polymer, has been used as a colorimetric probe for selective sensing of multiple metal ions (Cu2+, Co2+ and Fe2+) with clearly distinguishable color in aqueous solution. The selective coordination of Cu2+ with the chelating amines of HPEI induced a visible color change from colorless to blue across a wide pH range (pH 4.0 to 10.0). Other metal ions did not show any significant color change. Interestingly, the addition of Co2+ and Fe2+ into HPEI in the presence of silver ions (Ag+) leads to the formation of strong yellow and brown colors, respectively. The control studies suggest that Co2+ and Fe2+ undergo oxidation and reduce the silver ions into silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). The strong surface plasmon resonance (SPR) vibration of the AgNPs was responsible for the yellow/brown color. UV-visible studies showed a strong absorption peak at 400 nm for Co2+ and a broad absorption with λmax at 420 nm for Fe2+. HR-TEM studies confirmed more uniform spherical AgNPs for Co2+ with HPEI-Ag+ and polydisperse AgNP aggregates for Fe2+. The limit of detection of the HPEI probe for Cu2+ is 0.25 μg L-1 and those of the HPEI-Ag+ probe for Co2+ and Fe2+ are 40 and 30 μg L-1, respectively. The practical application of the HPEI probe for selective sensing of multiple metal ions with distinguishable colors has been demonstrated on Whatman filter paper. Thus, simple commercially available HPEI has been successfully used for the selective colorimetric sensing of biologically important Cu2+, Co2+ and Fe2+ metal ions in aqueous medium. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.},

abstract={The need for a highly effective contrast agent that aids in distinguishing normal and affected cells is in great demand in clinics for accurate diagnosis. In this context, the present study attempts to utilize the metal ion complexation capacity of a pharmacologically relevant dietary flavonol, quercetin for development of a novel MRI contrast agent. The flavonoid-metal complex was synthesized using quercetin dihydrate and gadolinium acetate and characterized by elemental analysis, spectroscopy techniques, thermal analysis and powder XRD. The quercetin:gadolinium stoichiometry was determined to be 1:1 using Job's plot analysis and the equilibrium stability constant of metal binding to quercetin determined from fluorimetric analysis using Stern-Volmer equations indicated excellent stability. The magnetic properties of the complex were typical of a paramagnetic material as confirmed using vibrating sample magnetometry. The antioxidant property of the quercetin-gadolinium complex was greater than that of its parent ligand when evaluated by DPPH assay due to the structural changes. Cyclic voltammetry studies of both quercetin and its gadolinium complex were performed to confirm complexation and anti-oxidant potential. The viability of cancer cells, MCF7 and normal L929 cells remained unaffected after exposure to the complex. The efficacy of this complex as a positive contrast agent in MRI was evaluated using phantom agar gel assay and in vitro studies. It was found to exhibit superior positive contrast when compared with the commercially available contrast agent. This complex therefore may be evaluated further as a novel MR contrast agent for pre-clinical and clinical applications. © 2015 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

Increase in wt % of SiC tends to increase in micro hardness and tensile strength but it reduces the bend strength and elongation (%) of the material. Using empirical model wt % of SiC in Al - SiC composite was optimized. Optimized result showed 7.66 wt % of SiC have maximum desirable result between wt % (4% to 12%) of SiC reinforcement. Al - 8% SiC have good micro hardness and tensile properties without losing the elongation (%) and bending strength.

abstract={Diseases are growing stronger every now and then coping with the Dalton's theory of Survival of Fittest. To compensate such a drastic growth in vulnerability, medicines are also being well equipped. Scientist and doctors work tirelessly to fix the disease that pop every now and then. One such chronic, life threatening disease is the Cardiac Disease which is more prevalent in all parts of the world. Medical world is working a whole lot of ways to get remedy for this chronic disease. Last decade enormous amount of research had been set on track to find the cause and remedy to heart diseases. The literature signifies that not only is advancement in medical field efficient but also research models in computing field drive more accurate results. In this paper efforts are made to bring computers into medical field by proposing a statistical model. This model is wrapped using an Improvised Novel Fuzzy Clustering (INFC) which is a cross amalgamation of Prism classifier and Fuzzy Clustering methodology. This duo fold scheme drives the model for better accuracy. The methodology is incorporated to a real time dataset from Cleveland Hospital.

abstract={Study of pulsed current TIG welding parameter on Al - 8% SiC composite about micro hardness, microstructure and correlation between micro hardness and microstructure. Experiment was designed using Taguchi L9 orthogonal array techniques to reduce the number of experimental run from 81 to 9. Micro hardness values observed form weld centre to heat affected zone. Microstructure was also observed on weld zone and heat affected zone. Correlation between micro hardness and microstructure was studied and the following results were observed. Coarse grain microstructure gives micro hardness value around 60HV and Fine grain microstructure gives micro hardness value around 70HV. Pulsed current TIG parameter such as peak current of 160A, base current of 60A, pulse on time - 50% and pulse frequency was 5Hz showed fine grain microstructure with micro hardness value of 75HV. Weld zone showed microstructure's grain size which is finer than the heat affected zone microstructure's grain size. © 2006-2015 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).},

abstract={Rapid increase in technology for faster and smarter innovations that smoothens the needs of humans resulting in use of super tech gadgets, which use memory, such as, RAM. To meet the increasing demands, the size is getting reduced and the need to save power arises which reduces the equipment for cooling processes and maintenance. The SRAM cells with lower power dissipation and proper read and write stability is required. This study deals with the design of SRAM cells with low power dissipation in comparison with the conventional SRAM cell design. The SRAM cell design ranges from 3-14T depending on the importance of the application. Here we choose the 6T SRAM cell. The elementary structure uses pass transistor and CMOS, while the proposed SRAM consists of Transmission gates, CMOS, Pseudo-NMOS. This proposed model is compared with two other models of varied 6T SRAM cell. This study also exemplify with the new Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) techniques with SRAM cell architecture and the layout area with power dissipation results are compared with the existing voting mechanism in 50, 70 90 and 120 nm foundry fabrication process technologies. It is apparent that the proposed voting circuit produces less area at the cost of power dissipation. © 2015 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

abstract={Since the performance of portable electronic products increases continuously with demand, there is a need for low power digital VLSI design. Due to limited backup time of batteries, the operating time of portable electronic products is highly restricted. So, the designers now concentrate on low power rather than the speed of the device or system. We implement a 4 bit barrel shifter using different flavors like conventional CMOS logic, pass transistor logic and transmission gate logic styles. Electronic Computer Aided Design (CAD) tools like Microwind and a DSCH are used in our simulations by which the comparison of power in each style is provided. Microwind is used a layout editor and DSCH (Digital Schematic) is used as a schematic editor. Results show that the pass transistor logic consumes less power with minimum area and good performance. We used BSIM4 MOSFET model in 0.12 μm for experimental results. To improve the reliability of the circuits, fault tolerant voter circuits are implemented. The results are compared with the existing approaches and the proposed methods. © 2015 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

In order to improve the efficiency of evacuation operation, the classification rule mining process is used. Firefighters identify the evacuee based upon the real world data. Processing of real world data is tedious. It consists of many irrelevant data. In emergency fire evacuation operation, it is necessary to remove such data and classify evacuee based upon classification rules. The Classification rule with high accuracy is generated using Fuzzy Logic in Multi Objective Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm. The fire evacuation is done, based upon the rule created using the predefined PART algorithm. The MOPSO algorithm increases the accuracy of evacuee classification.

This paper empirically evaluated the impact in cost efficiency of the foreign banks operating in India by the investment in Information Technology (IT). The present study is based on panel data over the period of 2008-2012. For this paper, all the 27 foreign banks in India are being considered. This paper identifies the average cost efficiency of foreign banks operating in India found to be 64.6 percent over the entire period of study. The findings of this paper suggest that to some extent IT impact the cost efficiency of foreign banks operating in India. The difference in cost inefficiency between the banks (Best and Worst) is significantly increased by 11.5% in the period 2008-2012 by Information technology. Thus, some of foreign banks cost efficiency reduced by 11.5% for the period 2008-2012. The information technologies contribute to cost inefficiency. This is due to the higher cost for IT expenditure and realized benefit is comparatively smaller. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Software testing is playing a paramount role in software development, release and maintenance. Test suite length reduction without compromising on detecting faults improves efficiency. To achieve this, few test cases of the test suite needs to be eliminated. And, it is called as Test Suite Reduction. This scenario occurs mainly due to redundancy in coverage of requirements as well as code. And the elimination of such redundancies is called as reduction mechanisms. This is a breakthrough in software testing activities, as it reduces the time and effort consumption. This is an attempt to achieve software test optimization, which improves efficiency in testing without compromising on efficaciousness. There are other mechanisms available to achieve optimum amount of test cases. Such mechanisms are Test Case Prioritization and Test Case Selection. The need to strive for optimization is the time restriction in delivery of software product. This paper focuses and reviews the research articles pertaining to the Test Suite Reduction mechanisms. The objective of this study is to scrutinize what kind of techniques employed in test suite reduction. We searched the following electronic databases: Science Direct, Springer, and IEEE Explore.

The evolution of algorithms on image features is explained with some of their mathematical concepts, along with their limitations. Two videos captured from an unmanned aerial vehicle were used for experimentation. The performance of intensity based image registration using normalized cross correlation and Speeded Up Robust Features was observed by registering various frames of the videos. Intensity based methods perform well for all type of images when the images to be registered vary by only a translation. Feature based methods are suitable when the possible transformation between the images are unknown. Feature based methods fail when the images lack distinct features such as corner points. The study presented would enable one to choose the right methodology for each step of the image registration algorithm, for various real time computer vision applications such as navigation of unmanned aerial vehicles.},

The buckets which are used are made to rotate about a certain axis thereby enabling them to transfer the materials efficiently. This system can be used in places where the space is limited. The system has been modeled using SOLIDWORKSTM and simulated using MSC ADAMSTM. A prototype has been made which shows how the system works. The results indicate that it is an efficient way for material transfer in vertical direction.

abstract={Background/Objectives: Pressed and sintered Al1100 powder is subjected to Equal Channel Angular Pressing (ECAP) process to study densification and deformation behaviour under different initial relative density and shear friction conditions. Methods/Statistical Analysis: Commercially pure Aluminium (Al 1100) powder containing 99% Al, 0.05-0.2% Cu, 0.05% Mn, remainder of Si, Fe and Zn is processed through normal powder metallurgy route followed by ECAP process. Finite Element Analysis through simulations are carried out using DEFORM 2D software for different initial relative densities of 0.700, 0.750 and 0.800 under three friction coefficients of 0.05, 0.075 and 0.15. Effective stresses, strains and loads are plotted. Findings: Full densification is achieved near the inner corner of the die channel compared to the outer corner at the end of the process. Uniform densification (relative almost greater than 0.980) is achieved in the middle portion of the specimen. As the friction is increased load required also increases. Formation of dead zone near the inner corner of the die channel reduces as the initial relative density is increased from 0.700 to 0.800. With higher initial relative density, complete densification occurs in the lower friction conditions like close to 0.05 shear friction coefficient. Effective stress is higher in the plane of intersection of the die channels where the actual deformation occurs. With the increase in initial relative density, effective strain also increases along the length of the specimen whose value is higher near the top portion of the die channel as compared to the bottom portion. Application/Improvements: ECAP eliminates residual porosity. Ultra fine grained structures are produced, even finer (better mechanical properties) than that by ECAP of cast products. Best suited for aerospace, defence and biomedical applications.},

NCP strategy is adaptable to diversity channels and diversity order irrespective of their number which is not in case of LCP scheme. At end Nonlinear Constellation Precoding (NCP) with subcarrier grouping is introduced. As a conclusion, in future if the same procedures are implemented in the OFDM part of MIMO-OFDM system it will provide improved BER than conventional MIMO-OFDM system.},

abstract={Objectives: To develop a theoretical model to predict the surface Roughness (Ra) of different metallic surfaces using acoustic signals. Methods: Acoustic signals are generated with the help of dry friction contact between two metallic surfaces. In this work, Cast iron and Mild Steel Samples from different machining processes are collected and the dry friction contact is made with HSS and Tungsten Carbide Tools to generate the acoustic signals. The acoustic signals obtained through a microphone are processed using MATLAB. Number of Samples versus Amplitude is plotted and then the resulting output is plotted as Time versus Amplitude. Subsequently the external noises from the acoustic signals are removed to get a reliable roughness value. Findings: The maximum amplitudes of the samples are tabulated and used for the deriving model for the surface roughness prediction. Theoretical model of HSS with various machining processes samples is y = 1.6865 ln(x) + 8.9978. Theoretical model of Tungsten carbide with various machining processes samples is y = 6.302 ln(x) + 27.337. Both the models are correlating with a trend line of 0.9. Application: This theoretical model can be used to predict the surface roughness (Ra) of metallic surfaces. This approach can be implemented in surface finish measuring devices.},

abstract={Image segmentation is an important process in Melanoma diagnosis. It divides the image into segments which provides a better path for extracting features and classifying them accordingly and so far many literatures have explained how the segmentation has been carried out for gray scale images. Though most algorithms have been written for gray scale images it is not necessary that we must stick on only to that instead we can also use color images directly for segmentation process. On doing so, variation in color can be used as an important feature for melanoma diagnosis. Color is a unique feature which can be used to provide a distinct differentiation between Melanoma and Benign. Hence on applying this color image segmentation, earlier detection can be done easily. This literature presents a survey on existing techniques for color image segmentation. Color images when segmented directly, yields better differentiation between the lesions.},

abstract={Wavelet analysis has become a significant computational tool in signal processing and image processing applications. The wavelet analysis is renowned for its successful approach to the problem of analyzing a signal in both time domain and frequency domain. Analyzing non stationary signal had been a big challenge for various transform techniques. The transform techniques such as Fourier Transform (FT), short time Fourier Transform (STFT) are failed in analyzing nonstationary signals. But wavelet transform (WT) techniques can be able to analyze both stationary and non stationary signals in an effective manner. WT is capable to analyze one dimensional signal like audio signals and two dimensional signals like images. In this paper wavelet transform techniques and its applications are discussed in detail and the experimental results are shown using MATLAB simulation software tool. © 2015, International Journal Of Pharmacy and Technology.

abstract={Image enhancement is considered as one of the most important techniques in image research. The main aim of image enhancement is to enhance the quality and visual appearance of an image, or to provide a better transform representation for future automated image processing. Many images like medical images, satellite, aerial images and also real life photographs suffer from poor and bad contrast and noise. It is necessary to enhance the contrast and remove the noise to increase image quality. One of the most important stages in medical images detection and analysis is Image Enhancement Techniques. It improves the clarity of images for human viewing, removing blurring and noise, increasing contrast, and revealing details. These are examples of enhancement operations. The enhancement technique differs from one field to another depending on its objective. The existing techniques of image enhancement can be classified into two categories: Spatial Domain and Frequency Domain Enhancement. In this paper, we present an overview of Image Enhancement Processing Techniques in Spatial Domain. More specifically, we categorise processing methods based representative techniques of Image enhancement. Thus the contribution of this paper is to classify and review Image Enhancement Processing Techniques as well as various noises has been applied to the image. Also we applied various filters to identify which filter is efficient in removing particular noises. This is identified by comparing the values obtained in PSNR and MSE values. From this we can get an idea about which filters is best for removing which types of noises. It will be useful and easier to detect the filters for future research.},

abstract={Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based designs are the most popular trend towards semiconductor technology evolution. The important subsystem in a configurable logic block is a Look-Up Table (LUT) in the FPGA chip. If the power reduction techniques are implemented in the LUTs, there would be an overall very less power while implementing the design in FPGAs. This study mainly focuses on designing LUTs using Programmable Read Only Memory (PROM) circuits. To implement these LUTs, half adder, full adder, half subtract and full subtractor circuits are chosen with PROM concept. Both the conventional CMOS and pseudo-nMOS style architectures are built for the LUTs. Pseudo-nMOS based LUTs are offering less area and low power compared with conventional CMOS approach. A pseudo-nMOS based full adder LUT design produce 564.5 μm2 layout area, which is less compared with 765.5 μm2 produced by conventional CMOS full adder LUT. A pseudo-nMOS based full subtractor design produce 1.119 μW dynamic power dissipation, which is less compared with 3.905 μW produced by conventional CMOS full subtractor. Also the design cycle time for FPGAs are much less compared with ASICs. Simulation results are verified using Microwind and Digital Schematic (DSCH) Electronic Computer Aided (CAD) design tools with BSIM4 MOSFET model in 60 nm technology. This study conveys that how the Programmable Read Only Memory (PROM) can act as a Look-Up Table (LUT) within a FPGA architecture. Since engineers are designing the circuits with most care with circuit design, layout design, etc., Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC) are the best at providing low power, high speed and low size at the cost of design cycle time. But with the current semiconductor technology growth, even FPGAs are being manufactured with high speed with more versatile functionalities.},

abstract={In the current semiconductor technology evolution, there is a huge demand in designing a low power, high speed adders with less area. As adders are essential components in the data-path of any computer system, adder modules are needed to be enhanced for better performance. One such efficient adder implementation is the Carry Look-Ahead Adder (CLA) which is designed to overcome the latency introduced by rippling effect of carry bits in a conventional Ripple Carry Adder (RCA). Further, the use of this CLA module in the place of Ripple Carry Adder module inside a Carry Select Adder (CSEA) is proposed for increased speed. Also, a novel implementation of adder, making use of the fact that the sum and carry are compliment of one another, except when all the inputs are same is presented. Simulation results show that a 4-bit carry select adder provides a better performance at the cost of power dissipation as 89.211 μW compared with 38.414 μW by a ripple carry adder with 0.12 μm technology processes. In this study, these high speed adders are implemented with the help of the Digital Schematic (DSCH) software tool, Micro wind layout editor tool and Quartus II synthesis software tool. This Quartus II synthesis tool is used for the implementation of adders on Altera EP2C20F484C7 FPGA device. These kinds of adders are further to be extended to build high-speed multipliers which are most important for the applications like digital signal processors, microprocessors, etc.},

abstract={Snake robots are versatile in nature by moving on different kinds of surfaces. Frictional forces play a vital role in propelling the snake robot. While moving in cluttered environments, there is a chance for the robot to topple from its initial orientation. Even if it topples, it needs to propel itself and explore the further areas in the toppled position which has different orientation than the initial one. Mechanisms to set right the snake robot to its initial position make it heavier. Hence there is a need for a 360 degree friction inducing mechanism which aids in propelling the snake robot even if it topples from its original position. This friction inducing mechanism is created using a bevel-disk-bevel cam whose design is explained in this paper.},

abstract={This study presents self-checking designs for arithmetic and logic circuits using Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) design. At present, we are implementing every circuit using VLSI technology because of its excellent features like low power, less area, wide implementation. Since finding error manually is a tedious process, self-checking method would be most wanted. Self-checking circuits are preferable to Automatic Testing Equipment (ATE) because they demand less hardware, low cost and takes very less test application time. The replica construction and pattern recognition are the two methods presented for self-checking logic gates. Self-checking single-bit full adder, 4-bit adder and 2-bit multiplier circuits are implemented and tested on EP2C20F484C7 Altera Cyclone-II FPGA device using Very High-Speed Integrated Circuits Hardware Description Language (VHDL) script. The test data input samples are applied through input switches and the Error/No Error results are obtained on the 7-segment display device. This study discuss in detail about basic self-checking methods with a experimental way. If the complexity of the circuit increases, the components used and the number of connections between the components increases. As a result, the probability of error occurrence increases for complex designs. But this error occurrence can be avoided to the maximum by using self-checking circuits at different build stages in the complex circuit model. The reliability of any system becomes very important especially in the area of applications such space technology, medical image analysis, military communications, etc.},

abstract={Melanoma is a deadly skin cancer which increases the death rate at a faster rate. In order to bring the death rate under control, melanoma should be detected at its earlier stage. To achieve this, researchers have introduced Computer aided diagnosis and adopted the same. In this technique, Segmentation is found to be one of the important steps. Many algorithms exist in practise for segmentation,where one of the important algorithms is Traditional Otsu Segmentation Algorithm. In this algorithm the major drawback is that the segmentation is improper in the presence of variable illumination. This paper proposes an algorithm "Normalised Otsu Segmentation" which overcomes the above mentioned drawback and results in an accurate segmentation. This algorithm first normalises the image to overcome variable illumination and then segments the image using Otsu algorithm. The accurate result given by this algorithm can be used in further steps to detect the lesion accurately which will provide a hand a for reducing the death rate.},

abstract={Adaptive filters are playing a vital role in signal processing and communication filed of engineering for the purpose of filtering the unwanted signal, signal denoising, signal enhancement, etc. The main characteristic of the adaptive filter is the adjustment of filter coefficients dynamically with respect to the input signal which helps a lot in signal processing applications. This study main focus on implementing such adaptive filters on digital signal processors. The adaptive filtering algorithms such as Least Mean Square (LMS) algorithm and Normalized LMS (NLMS) algorithms are implemented with TMS320C6713 floating-point DSP processor using LabVIEW environment in real time. To test the functionality of the algorithms, the sinusoid signal is added with noisy and applied as an input the filter and the resultant denoising output is obtained with both the algorithms. We implement it with TMS320C6713 floating-point Digital Signal Processor using LabVIEW environment in real time. Our objective is to reduce or filter the noise using these algorithms and obtain the performance metrics like peak output, Mean Square Error (MSE), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) as a part of simulation results. The PSNR produced by the NLMS algorithm is obtained as 18.414 is very high as compared with 3.28416 produced by the LMS algorithm. Interfacing the TMS320C6713 DSP board with the LabVIEW application is done using the Code Composer Studio software tool. This study focuses the principle of adaptive filters by implementing the Least Mean Square (LMS) algorithm and Normalized LMS algorithms and can be further extended with Kalman filters too. er.},

abstract={Joining of aluminium alloys and aluminium composites are done using TIG welding, due to its economic and good quality welds among arc welding processes. During TIG welding of aluminium alloys &amp; aluminium composites coarse grain structure formation and intermetallic formation in weld zone will result in poor mechanical properties such as reduced strength of the weld. These problems can be rectified by using the optimized pulsed current parameter of pulsed current TIG welding. Pulsed current TIG welding parameters have greater influence on weld zone and heat affected zone's microstructure &amp; mechanical properties. To optimize the pulsed current TIG welding parameters such as peak current, base current, pulse on time and pulse frequency experiment is designed using Taguchi L9 orthogonal array technique. From the experiment, effect of pulsed current parameters peak current, base current, pulse on time and pulse frequency on weld centre micro hardness was evaluated. Regression equation was developed using Design Expert ® statistical software to predict the weld centre micro hardness. Correlation co-efficient (r2) showed 0.99 and error % showed less than 1% which means the regression equation developed was more consistent. Empirical model was developed to optimize the pulsed current parameters of PCTIG welding was also performed using Design Expert ® statistical software. Optimized values for pulse on time, pulse frequency, peak current and base current were 54.79%, 5.12Hz, 160A and 60A respectively. Optimized predicted value of weld centre micro hardness has been observed as 77 HV. Trial runs were performed for optimized PCTIG welding condition to check the consistency of the model, which resulted only 5% of deviation between experimental values and predicted values. This showed optimized pulsed current parameters of PCTIG welding resulted in higher micro hardness which implies that strength of the weld is increased.},

abstract={Background/Objectives: Parallel manipulators edge over serial manipulators for their performance characteristics such as high accuracy and low inertia. In this paper, PRR planar parallel manipulator with elevated links was studied and analyzed. Methods/Statistical Analysis: Kinematic simulation was carried out and the workspace of the manipulator was determined. Static analysis including stress analysis, torque and inertia computations was made. Stress analysis of manipulator was done by ANSYS. Findings: Simple analytical method was employed for finding workspace area. The load bearing capability of the non planar links was high compared to the planar links. The inertia computations of the lead screw and the inclined links provide promising results for system dynamics. Application/Improvements: Non-planar links will be useful for manipulators facing challenges in dynamics.},

abstract={Objectives: The work is to identify the Quality of Service metrics for mobile ad hoc networks during hacking and counter hacking mechanism. Methods: The various quality metrics such as end to end delay, throughput and packet delivery ratio is determined. The implementation is done using ns2 simulator with the nodes at random waypoint mobility model. The performance is measured during intruder attack and counter attack for 20 nodes with 1000 packets of 512 bytes size. Findings: The simulation results showed a significant increase in packet delivery ratio for counter attack mechanism (98) when compared with intruder attack, which gave least value (40.6). This work is also compared with Anti Black Hole Mechanism and is found to be efficient in terms of packet delivery ratio. Improvements: In this work, all the nodes are assumed to be of maximum energy in terms of its battery power. While routing the energy drops and this is a major issue in ad hoc nodes. The future work will focus on energy efficiency during routing process.},

abstract={Background/Objectives: The commercial hollow air filters mostly used in automobiles are made out of cotton gauge, paper, fibrous materials, foam, etc. These filter's initial cost is low but maintenance cost of these is much higher than their initial cost with lower life span. The aim of this research work is design and simulation of a hollow cylindrical air filter fabricated using a ceramic material such as Silicon Carbide. Methods/Statistical Analysis: Research on air filters have focused on four main criteria, viz. less pressure drop, high air flow, superior dirt protection and less overall cost. Hence the major parameters were designed based on these factors and also by using Ergun's equation by considering the air filter as a packed column/bed. The important design parameters considered are particle size and pore size of the ceramic powder in order to have control over porosity. The filter model is designed using CATIA V5R16 and simulated using ANSYS FLUENT software. Findings: Ceramic air-filters can replace the existing air-filters with even better pressure drop. The thickens of these filters are in the range of 5 mm to 10 mm which will result in huge savings compared to the existing vary large filters in terms of space required. A stack of this hollow air filters can also be effectively used for superior dirt protection. However using these filters with thickness more than 20mm will have higher pressure drop and hence it is not recommended to go beyond this thickness. As the filters are made out of ceramics the life span of the filter will be very high. Damage of the filter due to either the harder and sharp particles or due to cleaning process is avoided. Application/Improvements: The proposed ceramic air filters can be used in automobiles particularly in heavy vehicles which work in harsh and dusty environment such as quarries, cement and process industries. The improvements achieved as compared to current air-filters are the increase in life of the filters and efficiency of the engine.},

abstract={Aim of the present study an attempt was made evaluate anticancer property of Vitex trifolia in Ehrlich Ascites Carcinoma (EAC). The experimental animals, albino mice, were divided into five groups of four each. Group I served as control, Group II induced cancer using EAC (Ehrlich Ascites Carcinoma), Group 3 and 4 induced with EAC and treated with plant extract with 150 and 300 mg/kg body weight respectively for 14 days. Group 5 was treated with 5-fluorouracil (20mg / kg body weight) for 14 days. After collecting the ascetic fluid the mice were sacrificed by cervical decapitation and the blood was collected for biochemical analysis. The activity of enzymic and non enzymic antioxidants, Level of hexosamine, Sialic acid, and haematological parameter were analysed. Tumour volume and cell viability was on Ascites cell by tryphan blue exclusion method was performed. Group II animal showed increased activity of glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and increased level of reduced glutathione as compared with group I. The activities of enzymic and non enzymic antioxidant levels were restored significantly on Vitex trifolia extract treated group as compared with normal group mice. Increased cell viability and decreased tumour volume was observed on plant extract treated animals as compared with groups. The antioxidant and anticancer activity may be due to the presence of quinines secondary metabolites present in these extracts. From the above results it is concluded that the Vitex trifolia extract possess antioxidant and anticancer activities.},

Unlike wired networks the sensor nodes here are subject to resource constraints such as memory, power and computation constraints. Key management and Security are the area of research in WSN. To ensure high level security encryption is necessary. The strength of any encryption algorithm depends upon the key used. So Key Management plays a significant role. The proposed KMS using LLT matrix achieves both Node-to-Node communication and Group communication. The main objective of the scheme is to strengthen the data transferring security mechanisms and also to ensure efficient key generation and management along with authentication. The main feature of this proposed system is 100% Local-connectivity; efficient node revocation methodology, perfect resilience; three-level authentication cum key generation and the most importantly reduced the storage. The scheme and its detailed performance analysis are discussed in this paper.},

A series of fluorinated polyimides (FPI-1 to FPI-8) were synthesized from these new diols and 4,4′-difluorobenzophenone/4,4′-dichlorodiphenyl sulphone, through nucleophilic displacement reaction. The FPIs were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, proton nuclear magnetic resonance, X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetry, differential scanning calorimetry, solution viscosity, solubility test, and dielectric properties test. FPIs were amorphous and showed good solubility due to the presence of &gt;C(CF3)2 unit and flexible groups in the polyimides backbone. These FPIs also showed good thermal stability and the 10% weight loss occurred in the range 353-505°C. The limiting oxygen index values of FPIs were in the range of 31.5-39.1 and such FPIs can be used as self-extinguishing polymers. These FPIs have a dielectric constant in the range of 3.10-4.23 and can be used as high temperature electrical insulation materials. © 2015 SAGE Publications.},

Oceans harbor a large number of microorganisms; a few can synthesize NPs through green technology and are much superior in quality to the ones produced in the conventional way. The marine organisms themselves can detoxify nanomaterials, so a natural cycle is maintained to produce and detoxify nanomaterials in nature. The design and functioning of the organs of several marine organisms and their cellular organization can help to construct many nanodevices for medical treatment and daily life. Natural biological models are available in the ocean to design novel nanomachines, optical devices, sensors, filters, fuel cells, and acoustic machines. Seawater NPs can control the earth’s climate.

Group III: Ehrlich Ascites Carcinoma cell line (1×106cells) + Treated with AECF at a dosage of 150 mg/kg b.w/day for 14 days. Group IV: Ehrlich Ascites Carcinoma cell line (1×106cells) + Treated with standard drug 5- Fluorouracil at a dosage of 20mg/kg.bw/day for 14 days. After completing the experiment, the liver markers and antioxidants were analysed. Phytochemical screening of aqueous extract of Carum copticum leaves indicates the presence of flavonoids, tannins, glycosides, phenol, steroids, alkaloids, quinone, saponin and coumarin. Supplementation of Carum copticum significantly restored the liver markers and antioxidant markers on Ehrlich Ascites Carcinoma (EAC) bearing mice. The results of our study showed that the aqueous extract of C. copticum B. fruit pods has significant anti-tumour activity against EAC cell line, probably due to its phytochemicals. © 2015, Global Research Online.

According to the patch size and variation of the parameters disparity map result is computed. In the next method guided filter is preferred. By using guided filter edges were preserved and variation of the parameters like window size, radius disparity map has been obtained. Disparity with minimal cost for each pixel is preferred. The best one from the above two method has been found out and it is preferred for further processing. Therefore it is very easy to extract forth ground from background without affecting the latter. If geometry is known, Depth information can be inferred which makes us to prefer stereo image.

abstract={Cinnamon (Cinnamomum verum J. Presl) leaf essential oil is well cited in literature for its phytochemical richness with eugenol being the primary constituent. However, the concentration of the phytochemical components varies depending on several factors like climatic and geographical conditions. Analyzing the essential oil obtained from C. verum leaves from Palni Hills, Tamil Nadu using GC-FID and GC-MS revealed 19 components, representing 97.6 % of the oil with eugenol (81.7%), linalool (3.8%) and benzyl benzoate (3.9%) as the main constituents. Further, the individual concentrations of these three major constituents were compared with the major constituents of leaf essential oil of C. verum from other geographical regions in India. Owing to the idea of volatile oils involving in protection and plant-plant communication, this comparative study relating variations in the oil composition due to agroclimatic and geographical conditions could aid in understanding plant diversities.},

abstract={Abstract: Enhanced production of manganese peroxidase (MnP) by the mutant Pleurotus ostreatus MTCC 142 was carried out in a solid and submerged fermentation by using an agro-industrial waste (rice bran and wheat bran) under optimized conditions. Among the various substrate combinations examined, rice bran shows the highest MnP activity (273 U/L), when compared with the wheat bran (218 U/L). Maximum MnP (368 U/L) was produced when rice bran (5 g) at 75% moisture (w/v) was used with 1 mL inoculum at pH 4 and 25°C in the presence of 2% (w/v) glucose as a carbon source, 0.2% (w/v) sodium nitrate as a nitrogen source and 4% of (v/v) glycerol as an inducer for MnP production under submerged fermentation. MnP was purified from the culture fluid by using microfiltration (1.2 μm) and ammonium sulphate precipitation followed by ion exchange chromatography. Additionally, the protein content of the recovered supernatant was also noted. The purified MnP was a monomer, which showed a molecular mass of 58 ± kDa as determined by SDS-PAGE. Furthermore, the purified MnP was exploited for decolourization of structurally different azo dyes. Among the selected azo dyes, Ponceau S, Tartrazine and Trypan Blue were decolourized rapidly by the purified enzyme extracts under optimized condition and it was found to be 78, 56 and 59%, respectively. © 2014 Balaban Desalination Publications.

abstract={With the widespread quantity of records stored in various storage repositories it is exceptionally significant to craft a dominant and valuable mechanism for analyzing such data for retrieving the appealing patterns that could help in decision making. Data mining is a predominant technique which is used to extract the valuable details and patterns from the hefty repositories. People today turn out to be well conscious of the privacy seepage of their perceptive data and are extremely averse to share their information. The key area of apprehension is that non-sensitive data could convey insightful information such as facts and interesting patterns. Privacy preserving data mining (PPDM) is a new track in data mining which focus on hiding an individual’s characteristics without compromising the data usability. The primary idea of privacy preserving data mining was to perform data mining on confidential data. A number of schemes and routines have been utilized for this purpose. Data sanitization and extracting the data mining result from the modified data were the key issues to be addressed. The aim of this paper is to provide a complete review on approaches and techniques based on different aspects for ensuring privacy in data mining and points out their advantages and disadvantages. © Research India Publications.},

One of the biggest concerns in data mining is privacy preservation. In this paper, the privacy issue in data mining is addressed by a new privacy preserving data mining method that utilizes a random noise for perturbation. A random value when added to the original data set results in a new customized data set. The customized data set has precisely the similar dimension as the original data set. Experiments were performed on real life dataset and the outcome demonstrates that random noise perturbation proficiently preserves the intended information and also maintains the accuracy of data mining algorithm after data deformation. © Research India Publications.},

The adhered cement mortar that remains on the surface of the recycled aggregate affects the quality of recycled aggregate. This paper attempts to study the efficiency of sulfuric acid soaking treatment method for recycled aggregates and the effectiveness of using these treated recycled aggregates in concrete strength and durability. Three concrete mixes were prepared using natural coarse aggregate, untreated recycled aggregate and sulfuric acid treated recycled aggregate. The properties of aggregates and the effect of replacement of natural coarse aggregate (NA) with treated and untreated recycled aggregates in concrete were examined. The test results show that the behaviour of recycled aggregate has improved after treatment. The strength and durability characteristics of recycled aggregate concrete can be improved in a much better way by using the treated recycled aggregates in concrete. © 2015, Sphinx Knowledge House.

The influence of such services is the possibility to create new services from existing services. Service selection problems for the composite web service, as many other optimization problems, can have more than one objective function. Objectives are usually competing, i.e., the optimal solution which considers to one objective is the worst with regards to another objective. An optimal solution is thus a compromise between the various objectives.

abstract={The Cognitive Radio (CR) network is a system which lends help at the time of scarcity in spectrum. One of the process by which CR senses the spectrum is energy detection method with a fixed single threshold. When energy levels fall below the threshold, secondary user is permitted to use the spectrum of the primary user. It is shown by simulation results that having two levels of threshold i.e., double threshold improves performance by giving importance to one of the major aspects of CR, reducing the confliction of the primary and the secondary user. For enhanced performance under noise conditions, dynamic allocation or adaptive threshold is employed with the two levels of threshold. The system is made better by the use of multiple energy detectors on the reception end. © Maxwell Scientific Organization, 2015.},

abstract={The mechanical properties of nano-SiO<inf>2</inf> and nano- AI<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> concrete beams were experimentally studied. For this purpose, beams with conventional reinforcement (150 x 150 x 1000 mm) are tested. In the experimental program which is conducted on specimen of type two different types of nano particles i.e., and four different types of ratios are used viz. (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2). The experimental result showed that compressive and flexural strength measured at 28th day of the concrete mixed with nano-siO<inf>2</inf> and nano- Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> were higher than that of a plain concrete mix. The test results indicated that the incorporation of nano particles significantly enhanced the resistance to cracking behaviour of concrete. In the case of specimens without nano particles a sudden drop in the load was noticed beyond the peak load. On the other hand, nano particles concrete specimens exhibit more or less a flat descending portion of the curve beyond peak load. This indicates the improvement in the dimensional stability and structural integrity of the specimen even beyond the peak load when nano particles are added. © 2015, Sphinx Knowledge House.

According to Siddha literature dried drug powder is called Churnam. The rheological property of Thaleesadhi churnam dispersion in honey was studied in this work. Pure honey at room temperature was observed to exhibit Newtonian behaviour. The increase in relative viscosity with increasing concentration of dispersion was observed to be exponential with a 10 fold increase in relative viscosity at 20 % concentration. Also, with the increase in concentration the dispersion was observed to exhibit shear thinning behaviour. The dispersion of Thaleesadhi churnam in a non- recommended vehicle (milk) showed abrupt increase in viscosity of the dispersion. © 2015, Sphinx Knowledge House. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Hazardous metal pollution in water is increasing in the present day due to the discharge of industrial effluents into aquatic environment that possess a potential threat to human health. Among these metals, hexavalent chromium which exists in many industrial wastewaters is considered highly toxic and need to be treated before its disposal. The chromium can be removed by various methods such as ionexchange, membrane separation, ultra-filtration, ion flotation, electro coagulation, sedimentation and reverse osmosis have been employed In the intervention of various ideas in this scientific world, various alternative measures are being taken up for the removal from the effluents without making the environment to be hazard, but they may not be economical. Hence, in this study an experiment is being carried out for the removal in an efficient and economical manner using Banana Peel. Banana peel a discarded agricultural waste was used as bioadsorbent through easy and environmental friendly processes for removal of Chromium (VI) from aqueous solution through bisorption. Bisorption of Chromium (VI) onto banana peel was carried out by considering the influencing parameters such as adsorbent dose, contact time and the initial chromium concentration in solution. On account of this, for different adsorbent particle sizes it is evident that using adsorbent size of 150μm gives maximum adsorption rate (98%) and further decreasing the adsorbent size gives the same rate, hence 150μm particle size will be efficient..From the present investigation, it is evident that the banana peel has proven to be a proficient biosorbent for the removal of Chromium (VI) from aqueous solution. © 2015, Sphinx Knowledge House.

The support, silica gel, was derived from a novel precursor sugarcane leaf ash. Sugarcane leaf is chosen due to its abundant availability, low cost, and also as a means to remove the agricultural residue. Substrate concentration, pH, and temperature have been optimized to achieve maximum production of ethanol. Maximum ethanol production was obtained at a substrate concentration of 70% (v/v), pH 6 and a temperature of 30°C. Maximum ethanol production was found to be 16,200mg/L. Ethanol purity was determined and was found to be 97.79% pure (water free). Continuous ethanol fermentation was carried out in a packed bed reactor. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Most of the welding robots are programmed to weld specific workpieces through „teach and playback‟ method. To accommodate a variety of work pieces, the operator has to reprogram the robot for specific parts manually. This problem of reprogramming for each work piece can be obviated by utilizing vision based path planning. This paper presents an image processing method to recognize the seam in 3D from a single image. The background is eliminated through a novel algorithm proposed. The image coordinates of the seam recognized are quickly transformed into 3D world coordinates through an improved polynomial regression model. The effectiveness of the algorithm is validated by comparing with the CMM measurements. The results proved that the proposed method is capable of recognizing the seam even in the presence of illumination errors like glare, shadows, etc. Furthermore the proposed algorithm can detect the seam in curved surfaces as well as in flat surfaces. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Linear Inverted Pendulum (LIP) System is a classical and bench mark problem in robotics and in many other applications in control systems. A Linear Inverted Pendulum (LIP) system essentially deals with two challenges as stabilizing a pendulum which is highly nonlinear in nature and controlling the cart position. Like the pendulum angle control, the Cart Position Control is also a quite potential challenging task. It is challenging because of the fact that the wheeled cart adds to the condition for tracking of the trajectory. Hence it is essential to track the required trajectory of the cart in a LIP system. This study deals with the trajectory control of Cart of a LIP model. A laboratory scale LIP has been considered the entire analysis and for which intelligent fuzzy, self-tuned fuzzy PID and GA tuned PID controllers are designed and are implemented in real time. In order to have a fair comparison, the real time results are compared with simulation results and a quantitative comparison has been carried out with IAE and ISE as the performance indices. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Clustering the Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is the major issue which determines the lifetime of the network. The parameters chosen for clustering should be appropriate to form the clusters according to the need of the applications. Some of the well-known clustering techniques in WSN are designed only to reduce overall energy consumption in the network and increase the network lifetime. These algorithms achieve increased lifetime, but at the cost of overloading individual sensor nodes. Load balancing among the nodes in the network is also equally important in achieving increased lifetime. First Node Die (FND), Half Node Die (HND), and Last Node Die (LND) are the different metrics for analysing lifetime of the network. In this paper, a new clustering algorithm, Genetic Algorithm based Energy efficient Clustering Hierarchy (GAECH) algorithm, is proposed to increase FND, HND, and LND with a novel fitness function. The fitness function in GAECH forms well-balanced clusters considering the core parameters of a cluster, which again increases both the stability period and lifetime of the network. The experimental results also clearly indicate better performance of GAECH over other algorithms in all the necessary aspects. © 2015 B. Baranidharan and B. Santhi.},

abstract={Purpose: Calcium oxalate urolithiasis is one of the most common urinary tract diseases and is of high prevalence. The present study proposes to evaluate the antilithiatic property of hydrogen sulfide and its metabolites like thiosulfate &amp; sulfate in an in vitro model. Materials and Methods: The antilithiatic activity of sodium hydrogen sulfide (NaSH), sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3) and sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) on the kinetics of calcium oxalate crystal formation was investigated both in physiological buffer and in urine from normal and recurrent stone forming volunteers. The stones were characterized by optical and spectroscopic techniques. Results: The stones were characterized to be monoclinic, prismatic and bipyramidal habit which is of calcium monohydrate and dihydrate nature. The FTIR displayed fingerprint corresponding to calcium oxalate in the control while in NaSH treated, S=O vibrations were visible in the spectrum. The order of percentage inhibition was NaSH&gt;Na2S2O3&gt;Na2SO4. Conclusion: Our study indicates that sodium hydrogen sulfide and its metabolite thiosulfate are inhibitors of calcium oxalate stone agglomeration which makes them unstable both in physiological buffer and in urine. This effect is attributed to pH changes and complexing of calcium by S2O3 2-and SO4 2- moiety produced by the test compounds.},

abstract={Healthiness of a power transformer is very vital in today’s developing world for ensuring reliable and quality power supply to consumers. Transformer insulation fails mainly due to ingress of moisture and various traditional methods have been utilized to determine the moisture content in oil. Yet, identification of moisture which impregnates into the paper/ pressboard insulation or mechanical displacements of transformer windings due to accumulated short circuit forces during electrical faults, through a nondestructive technique is still a complex task. Polarization Depolarization Current (PDC) analysis is an emerging and a reliable technique with which these flaws can be clearly identified and can even be effectively discriminated (whether it is in oil or pressboard) while the conventional methods (like Breakdown Voltage Test on oil sample) identify moisture in oil only. In this research study an attempt has been made to develop a simplified insulation model of a transformer and an experimental setup is implemented for acquiring the PDC waveforms of the transformer model at different insulation conditions. The flaws have represented through their possible impacts on the dielectric capacitance and resistance of insulation. Careful analysis of the observed variations in PDC patterns indicate and signify the behavioral changes of the flawed transformer dielectric systems. © Research India Publications.},

It also examines the factors influencing the volatility of exchange rate by employing GJR GARCH framework. For analysis, the study has divided datainto two periods: pre-crisis (from April 01, 2002 to January, 30 2008) and post-crisis (from February 01, 2008 to March 30, 2012). The following data was used by the study: monthly data on Indian rupee - US dollar bilateral exchange rate, net FII inflows, net dollar purchases and sales of RBI and inflation differentials between USA and India. The empirical results show that RBI interventionsare effective in reducing the volatility of the Indian rupee – US dollar exchange rateduring the pre-crisis period. However, RBI interventions seem to increasesexchange rate volatility duringpost crisis. Finally the results suggest that higher FII inflows caused the Indian rupee to appreciate vis-a-vis the US dollar but this appreciation was accompanied by an increased volatility in the exchange rate. © 2015 ASERS Publishing House.

abstract={Transformer forms one of the most vital electrical apparatus in a power transmission system and it is important to monitor the condition of transformer for safe and effective operation of the power system. An attempt was made to capitalize the frequency response of the transformer through transfer function approaches for fault diagnosis. When a transformer is subjected to any (mechanical and electrical) fault, any of the R, L or C parameters offered by the transformer winding changes, which leads to changes in the frequency response of the transformer. In the method attempted, known as sweep frequency response analysis(SFRA), a low voltage sinusoidal sweep signal covering frequency in the range between 20Hz to 2 MHz was used as signal and its responses like a current through the winding and voltage transferred to the other winding were observed. The ratio between input signal and its response at different frequencies were used to develop short circuit self impedance (SCSI), open circuit self impedance(OCSI), transfer voltage transfer function(TVTF) plots. PSPICE Simulation investigations were done on a wagner’s approximation RLC ladder model of a 3ph, 315kVA, 11kV/433V, Dyn11, ONAN distribution transformer for analyzing the efficacy of SFRA in electrical fault diagnosis. Hardware investigations were also done on 1 Phase, 1KVA, 240V/240V laboratory isolation transformer for electrical fault diagnosis. The hikes and dips of the transfer function plots were capitalized to diagnose the fault. It was observed that SFRA was capable of identifying the type of the fault, severity and location in transformers. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={In VLSI design circuits, System-On-Chip consumes more area due to huge data volume in the hardware. In order to reduce that constraint, the size of the trace buffer should be maintained constant. The trace data should be compressed to acquire huge amount of data. To compress those data several conventional techniques has been followed. Here in the proposed system, an approach called Look-Up-Table based dictionary compression method for System-On-Chip is used. It implements dictionary in such way that the most of the test vector frequencies are calculated which is to compress the test data in an efficient manner. This compression technique holds three different test vectors of all zero's, one's and X's value where most of benchmark circuitry frequency can be captured. This technique is implemented in those circuits using hardware description language and it is verified by XILINX Spartan-3E to know utilization of devices. Hence, it achieves more compression ratio with less area overhead without loss of data.},

abstract={Post-translational modifications on the tails of core and linker histones dictate transcription and have vital roles in disease and development. Acetylation and deacetylation events enabled by histone acetyl transferases and histone deacetylases (HDACs) on the chromatin milieu are intricately involved in gene regulation. Inhibition of HDACs is emerging as a powerful strategy in regenerative therapy, transplantation, development and in nuclear reprogramming events. Valproic acid (VPA), belonging to the short-chain fatty acid group of HDAC inhibitors, modulates the epigenome altering gene expression profiles across cell lines. This work attempts to explore the methylation profiles triggered by VPA treatment on human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293) through a biochemical and computational approach. VPA treatment (for 48 h) has been observed to hypermethylate lysine 4 on the core histone H3 and confers a hypomethylation status of H3 lysine 27 in HEK 293 cells leaving the nuclear area and nuclear contour unaltered. Our structural docking and Binding Free Energy (BFE) calculations establish an active role for VPA in inhibiting the demethylase JARID1A (Jumonji, AT Rich Interactive Domain 1A) and the methyl-transferase EZH2 (Enhancer of Zeste Homologue 2). This work has also proven that VPA can inhibit the activity of proteins like GSK3β and PKCβII involved in developmental disorders. This work establishes a dynamic correlation between histone methylation events and HDAC inhibition and may define newer epigenetic strategies for treating neurodevelopmental and oncological disorders. © 2014 Taylor and Francis.},

The proposed hybrid layered approach calculates syntactic, semantic and structural similarity between the classes from input ontologies in successive layers. Finally, the alignment layer generates the final matching results by combining the results obtained from the previous layers and generates semantic mappings between them. This approach overcomes the risk of generating incorrect matching results. The test dataset from OAEI are used for evaluating the proposed hybrid approach. The results obtained proved that the proposed approach overtakes the other existing methods by generating correct matching results thereby improving the accuracy of the results achieved. This approach can also be applied to match other entities of the ontology. Since the layers provide matching results based on user - defined threshold, it has the advantage of excluding the incorrect mappings. Thus the proposed hybrid layered approach helps to learn the knowledge hidden between the local ontologies leading to the improved precision.},

abstract={In wireless sensor network (WSN), the sensors are deployed and placed uniformly to transmit the sensed data to a centralized station periodically. So, the major threat of the WSN network layer is sinkhole attack and it is still being a challenging issue on the sensor networks, where the malicious node attracts the packets from the other normal sensor nodes and drops the packets. Thus, this paper proposes an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) mechanism to detect the intruder in the network which uses Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) protocol for its routing operation. In the proposed algorithm, the detection metrics, such as number of packets transmitted and received, are used to compute the intrusion ratio (IR) by the IDS agent. The computed numeric or nonnumeric value represents the normal or malicious activity. As and when the sinkhole attack is captured, the IDS agent alerts the network to stop the data transmission. Thus, it can be a resilient to the vulnerable attack of sinkhole. Above all, the simulation result is shown for the proposed algorithm which is proven to be efficient compared with the existing work, namely, MS-LEACH, in terms of minimum computational complexity and low energy consumption. Moreover, the algorithm was numerically analyzed using TETCOS NETSIM. © 2015 Ranjeeth Kumar Sundararajan and Umamakeswari Arumugam.},

abstract={Context: Neonicotinoid insecticides are synthetic analogues of nicotine that acts on the central nervous system of insects by blocking post synaptic acetylcholine receptor. Acetamiprid is one of the widely used neonicotinoid class of insecticide used to control sucking insects like aphids, bees, mosquitoes, on crops. Data on the possible immunotoxic nature of acetamiprid are lacking. Objective: The present study was conducted in Wistar rats with the objective of evaluating the immunotoxic potential of acetamiprid administered orally at the dose levels of 27.5, 55 and 110 mg/kg b.w. (equivalent to 5.5, 11 and 22 mg/kg b.w.) for a period of 90 days. Materials and methods: In experiment 1, general toxicity testing including the evaluation of clinical signs, hemato-biochemical changes, response of the lymphocytes towards T and B cell mitogens, macrophage function, gross and histopathology of the lymphoid organs (spleen, thymus, lymph nodes, etc.) were performed. In the second experiment, humoral and cell-mediated responses during immunological challenges were evaluated. Results: Significant decreases were observed in the stimulation index of lymphocyte proliferation to B cell mitogen and in the nitrite production of macrophages of rats treated with 110 mg/kg of acetamiprid. Significant decrease in the lymphoproliferative response towards the B cell mitogen indicated the inability of the B lymphocytes to respond on stimulation that might increase the chances of susceptibility to infections. Acetamiprid also caused 15-28% reduction in nitrite production, an important signal for efficient inflammatory response of macrophages. The functional impairment of macrophages may involve aberrations in the enzymatic degradation of microbes, oxidative burst, generation of free radicals, phagocytosis, release of proinflammatory cytokines and thereby, may hamper host defence causing susceptibility to diseases. No significant changes over hematology, biochemistry, organ weights, histopathology of major immune organs, delayed type hypersensitivity test, response to sRBCs and lymphoproliferation assay for T cell mitogen were observed. Conclusion: In conclusion, the results demonstrate for the first time that the subchronic administration of acetamiprid (20% SP-soluble powder) cause significant decreases in the lymphocyte proliferation as well as the macrophage function at the dose level of 110 mg/kg. Considering the chronic population adjusted dose (0.023 mg/kg/day) through dietary exposure for acetamiprid, judicious use of acetamiprid is highly essential. Indiscriminate use of acetamiprid exceeding the doses advised might pose a hazard. © 2014 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.},

abstract={Nowadays, a lot of attacks have cropped up for phishing of emails and password of users. In order to get one's confidential information like passwords, bank details such as debit or credit card numbers illegally, phishing act can be done. For doing an identity theft or financial gain or some fraudulent activities, an individual or group of persons gets confidential information from unsuspecting victims via email. This study proposes data mining techniques to classify phishing data's and then attempts to rectify phishing. A decision classifier tree model is used for detecting phishing datasets and another hybrid session based model is also developed to escape from such phishing attacks. The use of the session based unique password is scrutinized to protect the privacy of the users which is not revealed by attacks or infected systems. The proposed model generates a novel minimum spanning tree called iTree which takes only a minimum time to construct it. The proposed iTree model classifies the inputs which are resistant to a number of phishing attacks and is also resilient to keyboard logging as well, thus ensuring reliability. The tree classifier model will be able to identify any types of attacks in the future. The proposed models of session based authentication and data mining based decision tree classification are much more accurate in the usage of the antiphishing than the existing method. © 2006-2015 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).},

abstract={Two-phase flows play a vital role in refrigeration, air conditioning, and other industrial applications. This necessitates the development of precise techniques to characterize various two-phase flow regimes. In the present work, characterization of two-phase flow in horizontal tubes of diameters 4.7mm and 3.4mm is done by analyzing laser patterns. Laser patterns are recorded using a high-speed camera. The area occupied by laser patterns for air-water and air-oil flows is analyzed by applying grayscale analysis and distance transformation techniques in image processing. A technique based on the movement of the centre of intensity of the laser pattern is used to characterize two-phase flow regimes. Centre of intensity of a laser pattern is the point with maximum pixel intensity in the processed image. Probability density estimation together with the position-time graph for centre of intensity is used to characterize two-phase flow patterns. Bubbly, slug, and stratified flow regimes are observed and analyzed. The slug length and velocity is calculated by analyzing laser patterns. The two-phase flow regime map is generated based on the identified two-phase flow patterns and is validated with a flow map for conventional channels available in the literature. © 2015 Canadian Society for Chemical Engineering.},

abstract={Stress is the physiological or psychological imbalance among the individuals when they find a disparity between a situational demand and their ability. Traditionally, management has taken the problem of stress as the workers' personal problem and the management also blamed the workers that they are not fitting themselves into the working environment. But, now-a-days, the management analyses the job requirements and the social relationships as the prime indicators of stress. With the advent of the technological inventions, the nature of job is deskilled and the worker is totally disconnected from the end product. This paved way for the high degree of boredom and decreased scope for improvisation. The objective of this study is to analyze the impact of socio-economic factors influencing the level of stress among the employees in State Bank of India, Tiruchirapalli. Random sampling method is used to collect the primary data from 150 employees of branches of State Bank of India in Tiruchirapalli district by administering a questionnaire. SPSS package is used to analyses the data collected with the help of ANOVA single factor and Weighted ANOVA. The results show that age and educational qualification, gender marital status and annual income do not influence the level of occupational stress. The increased level of stress for experienced respondents is due to the job hierarchy and extended responsibilities in the job. They stressed because of their expectation in the career elevation and incapacity to cope up with the innovation in the technologies. The respondents feel that they can manage in acquiring skill and knowledge to cope up with the job requirements and expectations. © Maxwell Scientific Organization, 2015.},

abstract={The data in embedded devices are prone to various security related issues and also the hardware limitations have to be examined. The conventional algorithms like AES, DES, and other such ciphers are incompatible with the modern embedded devices. Lightweight block cipher PRESENT, is the most suited algorithm is highly optimized to suit applications ranging from low embedded devices to high data critical functions. Owing to the fact that RFID security related issues poses a major threat to these intense critical applications, PRESENT is sought to be the feasible solution. The paper proposes the methodology of providing a highly secure solution to RFID with PRESENT. The ultra-lightweight algorithm is used to enhance the RFID security issues and in long term meeting out to the constraints. The addressable constraints such as power, memory and resource constraints are taken care of by this proposal. The scope can be further extended to data critical application in various streams, as PRESENT is proven highly efficient with the application intended. The paper anticipates the trends of providing the security for RFID based applications, by an encryption and decryption modules in two different locations. The cipher text is transmitted wirelessly through Zigbee units extending it to multiple RFID data to be encrypted and decrypted through the PRESENT algorithm.},

abstract={Device-to-Device (D2D) communication enhances user experience and resource utilization in any communication networks. D2D communication consumes high energy when operated on mobile phones, sensor nodes etc. As sensor nodes becomes the part of power constrained devices, energy efficiency becomes a challenge in D2D communication protocols. This paper focuses on increasing the energy efficiency and improving the throughput of D2D communication by using Data Fusion technique in sensor nodes. First, it works with tree based clustering technique to form minimum spanning tree which results in the nodes that communicate only with its neighbours in the network. Secondly, it adopts a methodology for selecting the cluster head (CH). The selection of CH is done on the basis of the unconsumed energy of each sensor nodes within each clusters after the completion of every round. So cluster head changes dynamically after every round which ensures that there will not be total nodal energy dissipation for the node that is acting as a cluster head. Data fusion algorithm focuses on merging two or more data packets into a packet of small size using Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST). The simulation results provided at the end of the paper concludes that the energy efficiency and throughput of devices using Data fusion is better than Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) and Power-Efficient Gathering in Sensor Information System (PEGASIS).},

abstract={Data mining is an emerging technology for applications such as text based mining, web based mining and it performs a major role in various domains for numerical data analysis, data statistics and machine learning. In this paper, data mining is used in machine learning of ANN (Artificial Neural Network). The Pruning technique in an MLP (The Multilayer Perceptron) neural network is to remove the unwanted neurons based upon their corresponding weights; as a result it improves the accuracy and speed of the network. In the existing system, based on their synaptic weights the pruning is performed and it removes the lowest weight neuron form the network. The result obtained from the existing method does not produce an optimized removal of the neuron. In the proposed system pruning is performed by using divisive clustering in MLP neural network. The main purpose of the Divisive algorithm in ANN is to split each neuron weight into sub neuron up to the fixed level and then remove the least weighted hidden neuron. The proposed method is implemented using the Java language. The Performance result obtained from the proposed method shows that it reduces the error rate and improves efficiency and accuracy of the MLP network. The present results confirm that DI-ANN (Divisive Artificial Neural Network) can provide a fast, accurate, and consistent methodology applicable to the neural network.},

abstract={Location based social networking systems add location as main dimension to the social connections which gives necessities for personalized location recommendations. Travel packages can be personalized by obtaining user preferences, POI attractions and patterns between them from LBSNs. Existing recommendation systems concentrate mostly either recommending locations , travel packages to a single user or not precise enough, just recommending a list of possibly suitable packages to select by a user group. In our system travel packages are personalized to a user group by considering their common interests, social connections among them along with their individual interests, constraints. Recommendations made precise by considering multiple metrics which varies in degree of personalization and time period of evaluation. We built a prototype system and evaluated results based on data obtained from foursquare site. Experimental results prove system recommends effectively in single user scenario and also adapted well to user group scenario.},

abstract={Nowadays security of information became an important issue. So it is mandatory to preserve the security of data that need to be transmitted in telemedicine application for proper and cost effective diagnosis. Steganography plays an important role in telemedicine application by providing confidentiality and integrity. This paper proposes a steganography technique which hides patient information inside medical images using a key dynamically generated by graph3 coloring and pixel count of cover image. Steganography is done along with cryptography by encrypting the patient information using RSA algorithm to strengthen the level of security. This proposed method maintains reversibility that the original medical images can be losslessly restored after the extraction of data from stego medical image. Experimental results show that this novel method is more secure as compared to other information hiding methods against various parameters such as computational complexity in key generation by unauthorized person and quality measure of reversed image in terms of Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Mean Square Error (MSE).},

abstract={Designing of confidential ICs must satisfy many design rules in order to rectify the various attacks and to protect the secret data. Based on the concept of withholding information, on-chip comparisons for actual and expected response have already been proposed. From the security point of view, few limitations of existing method limit the security level. Some countermeasures have been proposed in order to secure the scan technique and on-chip comparison. In this paper, an additional inverter is introduced within the scan chain architecture. The introduction of flipped scan chain increases the switching of scan output and increases the complexity to retrieve the secret data. On comparing with Traditional scan chain, proposed method results in only negligible area overhead with high security level. This result shows that possible trials will be more than 2#SFF to hack the data. The proposed method can be applied for all scan testing.},

abstract={The importance of electronic data and its rapid growth leads to gradual increase to the data usage over the network servers and on the other side high priority is needed for the data security and privacy. The existing keyword search schemes for data retrieval from the centralized storage uses keyword as a valid parameter. Even though, keywords are encrypted and then used, intruders are able to guess keywords and can verify it using offline dictionary attack. The ability of guessing keywords by intruders reveals the stored data which affects data security and privacy. We need an additional parameter to the keyword used for search which will make the keyword guessing attack impossible. The additional parameter we used in our encryption framework is a signature file whose content needs to be independent of data. The content of signature file can be any data such as image, table, text, etc. which depends on the choice of user. This signature is hashed with keyword which makes the adversary difficult to guess the content of signature of the user. The existing approaches used keyword along with private key as search parameters, the guessing of appropriate keyword reveals the private key of user. In our framework, addition of signature along with keyword ensures both authentication as well as data privacy.},

abstract={Bandwidth, an important most demanding computing resource is mainly focused on backup service in cloud computing technology. In addition to backup solutions, communication and transferring of data also involves a considerable amount of bandwidth for efficient throughput. Management of wide area network bandwidth provision and cost is a major challenge in recent periods. Due to enormous content in cloud, cost effective bandwidth provisioning solution should be adopted by the cloud providers for better user satisfaction. Here we use a min chunk hashing technique based on the content for preserving all chunks in order to reduce the overall transfer time for individuals as well as to reduce the resource allocation load on the cloud servers. Thus, content based chunking along with the metadata considerably reduces the cost of bandwidth utilization for individuals. The bandwidth usage is predicted using cloudsim simulator through BwProvisioner class provided in the cloudbus package. A sample of large text files with redundant data is refined, chunked and hashed using Message Digest5 to measure the transfer time and cost performance metrics for experimental values in a dynamic work load environment.},

In LBCA, the nodes are grouped into clusters such that network is controlled by the gateway instead of cluster head. This enhances the performance of the network. Load balanced clustering algorithm, improves the communication among dissimilar sensors in the network. To analyze the effectiveness of the technique, the performance of WSNs spread over numerous dissimilar routing procedures are considered. Simulation results indicate that regardless of the routing process used, our method improves the network lifetime.

abstract={Plasma is gas of charged and neutral particles that exhibit collective behaviour. Studies of dusty plasma associated phenomena are known to have applications in many astrophysical environments, laboratory environments and in industrial plasma systems. Presence of dust particles in plasma invariably changes their behaviour and become dominant in terms of energy and momentum transport.The most prominent of these techniques are the Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV). Dust structures and motion of dust particles in plasma are studied in the laboratory by making optical measurements using the scattering of laser light.Taking a sequence of image is one of the most important methods of diagnosing dusty plasma. Understand the motion of the dust particles is also very important from the point of view of controlled nuclear fusion. Presence of dust in controlled nuclear fusion reactor is not desired and large amount of dust is expected to be produced in thermonuclear reactor, hence understanding the behaviour of dust particles in plasma and its efficient removal from the reactor will be useful from the point of view of controlled nuclear fusion. It holds the promise of potentially limitless and clean energy. This paper undertakes a comprehensive review of the various techniques discussed in these research papers and attempts to qualify them based on their approach, accuracy of results, ease of implementation and critical shortcomings.},

abstract={Objectives: Road Transport is the primary source which is contributing to poor air quality. We propose, an Intelligent Toll Booth System to automate toll transactions and monitor the smoke emission from vehicles. Methods/Statistical Analysis: The automated toll operations are done based on the prepaid toll transaction card which is a passive RFID tag. The toll road usage is allowed based on the credit limit of the tag. The smoke sensor detects the amount of Carbon dioxide (CO2) exhausted from the vehicle. If it is beyond the specified range, a warning message is given to the vehicle possessor and to the respective transport office through GSM. Results: Intelligent Toll Booth System is validated to be more powerful, helpful and efficient than normal system for vehicle emission monitoring and prepaid toll transaction. It is apparent that our intelligent system proves to be more time conserving system and reduces the traffic congestion at toll booths, reduced labour and cost. Investigative results reveal that the proposed framework is viable for vehicle emission monitoring and prepaid toll transactions. Also this system agrees portability and needs very slight effort for smoke emission monitoring and toll transactions. Conclusion/Application: The proposed Intelligent Toll Booth system provides an efficient toll transaction method and smoke emission monitoring thereby reducing the congestion at toll booths.},

abstract={The aim of this paper is to develop the symbols (graphical view of flight indicators) of Primary Flight Display page at the host environment and to validate the symbols using GUI (Graphical User Interface) at run time. The symbols of these indicators can be developed using OpenGL libraries which gives no compatibility problems at the target system (Helicopter). With the support of these libraries, the symbols for the indicators can be developed. In the host environment, the data required for the symbols of flight indicators can be given manually by the developer at the compile time or at the run time using GUI. Based on the given data, symbols can be displayed and the developer can check the correctness of the symbols. The process of giving data (periodic data) to the program at the compile time and at the run time can be compared with each other. The method of initialising the structures at the compile time increases the number of times the program being executed. So the GUI is developed with all the required controls which can receive all the valid and invalid constant values at run time. It reduces the number of executions of the program. Thus improves the validation efficiency. With the support of developed GUI, the program can be executed for one time the symbols on OpenGL window can be validated against all the valid and invalid values. Thus improves the efficiency of validating the correctness of symbols by the developer. This process can be applied in the development and validation of other pages of IADS (Integrated Architecture and Display System).},

abstract={The Communication between objects in the cluster takes place through message passing techniques. Affinity Propagation (AP) clustering has been used successfully in a lot of clustering problems, which deals with static data. By applying Fuzzy DENCLUE, similarity between objects and its exemplar is improved. A dynamic variant of AP clustering called Incremental Affinity Propagation with K-Medoid (IAPKM) is used along with the Fuzzy Density based clustering (DENCLUE) method. In Fuzzy DENCLUE, number of clusters is reduced and randomness in the form of noise is removed. The experiment is performed in Net Beans 8.0.2 using jdk1.7 as a language. The evaluation result defines that the effectiveness and efficiency of IAPKM and Fuzzy DENCLUE can achieve comparable performance. Compared with IAPKM and Fuzzy DENCLUE, Sum of similarity and accuracy is increased in Fuzzy DENCLUE which is based on the parameters. The current approach achieves higher accuracy rate which is 10% greater than the former approach.},

abstract={Objectives/Background: Every successful construction project has to be completed within the budgeted cost and the scheduled time. Constraints affect the project success. Therefore, proper management is required to reduce the constraints. Methods: This study deals with the methods that reduce time and cost constraints and resource management. A construction of residential apartment is taken for this study which is undergoing a time and cost overrun. The constraints are reduced by using techniques interconnecting activities properly and increasing the resources, schedules are prepared by means of Primavera software. The cost constraints can also be reduced by managing labour resources of different categories. Results: The actual schedule of the project is considered as base schedule. The base schedule is compared with the modified schedule using techniques which helps to reduce constraints. Schedule made by the technique interconnecting activities properly gives a time difference for the completion of the project of about 5 months from the base schedule of the project. Schedule made by the combination of the both techniques shows the result of 7 months prior completion from the base schedule of the project. Further, with the management on the labour resource of skilled, unskilled male worker and unskilled female worker in the construction activities, the cost spent on the labour resources reduces by 5%. Conclusion: This study supports project manager to guide himself to control the constraints in the planning, execution process and shows the importance of proper allocation of labours of different categories.},

abstract={Objective: The main objective of assigning tasks among sensor nodes in wireless sensor network environment is to recuperate the information loss due to network failures and to increase the network life time. Methods: The consummate way for downsizing energy consumption among nodes is to assign the task in an efficacious manner. The renovated version of Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO) is employed for assigning tasks in WSN. If any task assigned sensor node does not perform its operations, then those are considered as vulnerable nodes which can be pruned away from the network to avoid network failures. Results: In this paper, task assignment, information recuperation and topology permutation are proposed for improving the permanency of the sensor network. The task assignment problem for data recuperation was implemented in TCL language on NS2 running under windows environment. To gauge the adequacy and viability of this framework, results are compared with a technique that does not involve data recovery in its implementation. In the proposed system, the calculated execution time subtracts the execution time of the vulnerable sensor node. Subsequently, it minimizes the general execution time and improves the network performance and lifetime relies on upon fluctuating network size and tasks. Thus, the overall lifetime of the WSN and also fault tolerance level of the WSN is augmented. Conclusion: Task execution time, energy utilization and sensor network lifetime are considered in the fitness function to make a legitimate tradeoff among distinctive metrics and get the best overall executionin the fitness function to make a legitimate tradeoff among distinctive metrics and get the best overall execution.},

To route data in efficient manner detecting optimal path for routing is better solution. For time critical application, detection of optimal path should be faster enough to make the application efficient. This paper focus on detecting of optimal path by using parallel ant colony optimization algorithm. K-Mean clustering approach is used for grouping of sensor nodes because it is faster than other hierarchical clustering algorithm. Rotating the cluster head while implementing algorithm based on friss free space propagation model, increases the lifetime of the network. This proposed system is developed using Java. The results shows that proposed system detect the optimal path faster than existing system with better lifetime of the network.},

abstract={The main objective of this paper is to aggregate the data in a secure way such that the tampering caused by the adversaries can be avoided and these secure authentication mechanisms ensure that the base station does not accept forged aggregation value. Previous data aggregation schemes make sure that base stations do not receive and agree with the false aggregation values. The authentication mechanisms are used to detect malicious nodes. But these mechanisms may not be efficient and they can be easily bypassed by hacking the keys used for encryption. A secure mechanism for aggregating the data has been put forward in which the two stages of verification are performed. In the first stage, Level based scheme is applied as the verification technique at each level. In this scheme, the keys are updated dynamically which enhances the security. Next stage of verification is the encryption of the packets by using its private key. The proposed secure data aggregation mechanism improves the performance and efficiency of the aggregation process. Analysis of experimental results indicates that the performance of the proposed scheme is twice that of the previous schemes.},

The SEARCH protocol helps to detect the energy level of each node in the WSN and helps to form Energy based Clustering to balance the load. The PSO Fitness Function and Apriori Association rules, helps to route the sensed data using efficient routing, by taking the amount of data transfer and the energy efficiency of all routes in order to maintain the energy for long term transmission.

Tensile, flexural and impact strength were investigated in the process of mechanical characterisation. Matrix material used is a phenolic resin of Ortho-Phthalic acid. The manufacture of the composite is done by hand lay- up technique where the fibre content is varied through volume fraction of 0.4 to 0.5. Setup is arranged in such a way that glass fibre is arranged on the top and bottom layers of the laminate which adds up strength and produces a better surface finish, where in the natural fibre is sandwiched in intermediate layers within the glass fibre. Fibre orientation and the detailed internal structure of matrix were studied by using SEM photography. The results showed that Abaca-banana-glass hybrid composite has better tensile property, Banana-glass composite has the best flexural property and Abaca-glass composite has the best impact property. The results obtained show a substantial increase in mechanical properties and hence these hybrid composites can be used as an effective alternative for synthetic fibres and can be used as an alternate for different industrial application. © School of Engineering, Taylor’s University.},

The Conventional state estimators used to estimate the true state of QT system from noisy sensor information has limitations such as model approximation and computational complexity. Kalman Filter (KF) widely known optimal estimator, it is limited only to linear processes. Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is an extended form of KF used for nonlinear process. Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) a modified form of EKF, addresses the shortcomings of Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). This investigation presents the comparative analysis of EKF and UKF based state estimation for QT that overcomes the disadvantages of the conventional estimators. Simulation of EKF and UKF based state estimation of QT is carried out in MATLAB software and the result indicates that the UKF provides the best estimation.},

abstract={Artificial neural networks are extremely useful in modelling of complex non-linear systems which are difficult to model using simple mathematical closed form equation. The wrinkling behaviour of a deep drawn sheet metal is an example of such a nonlinear system, predicting the pattern manually is difficult. This project aims to employ artificial neural network to learn the pattern of wrinkling along different orientations and devise an algorithm based on the observation that can provide the results for new set of inputs. The validation of the artificial neural network is carried out on experimented deep drawing process on stainless steel of various grades. The construction of the artificial neural network is based on experimented deep drawing process on stainless steel of various grades such as SS302, SS316, SS410, and SS430. It is found that the obtained values using ANN and the experimental values are in good agreement with each other. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Experimental and analytical investigation of plate welded box column is the objective of this study. Manual design of rectangular or square welded box columns are worked out according to IS 800:2007. The box column is subjected to axial compression and biaxial bending are checked for the combined loading and the interaction ratio is designed to be less than one. Different loading conditions, support conditions and cross sections are tried out for the manual design. 3mm and 6mm thick steel plates are welded together along with a base plate of side 130mm to form box columns of size 100mmx100mm is subjected to axial compression. Four models were made with different specifications. These specimens were tested in an Universal Testing machine which could test up to a maximum load of 100 tonnes. The maximum load carrying capacity of the box columns comes out to be 55 tonnes (maximum) according to IS 800:2007. The Experimental results are tabulated and compared with the manual design. The variations in results are studied and a conclusion is made to propose to the Bureau of Indian Standards regarding the increase in strength of welded box columns. This idea is further supported by FEM analysis in STAAD.Pro which also yields similar results. The box column is plate modelled in STAAD.Pro, the plates are subjected to uniform pressure at the top which is equivalent to the yield point load from the experimental investigation which in turn produced stress greater than the characteristics compressive strength of the box column thereby supplementing the experimental investigation. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={The aim of the project is to design a PID controller for the linear time varying DC motor system. The PID controller is tuned using online using Genetic Algorithm (GA). DC motor drive systems are often used in many applications such as robotics, lathes, drills and electric traction etc. All these applications require good speed control of motors. Speed control of DC drives are generally achieved using Proportional, Integral and Derivative (PID) controller. Tuning of PID controller is highly crucial for the speed control of motor. The PID controllers are tuned mostly according to the system's parameters and mathematical model.In this work Genetic Algorithm (GA), a soft computing tuning method is used to tune the PID parameters, Kp, Ki and Kd, for the regulatory speed control of a linear time varying (LTV) DC motor. The adopted method, GA, is a popular stochastic optimization technique based on the natural process of evolution. When applied to complex engineering problems, GA searches for the optimal solution in a wider space using diversity and crossover operators. This feature of GA distinguishes it from other classical optimization technique. The LTV mathematical model of the DC motor is whose denominator parameters are slowly and continuously changing with time is considered in the present work. A suitable stable PID controller parameters are found using GA. The tuned parameters are used in the controller online so as to control the speed of the DC motor. Simulations results are obtained using MATLAB are found to give satisfactory results.},

But the challenging task is detecting the quality assessment of image and risk for performing multidimensional data simultaneously. This problem is overcome by using multidimensional image quality prediction model of UGI social network environment. The proposed model analyses the image uploaded by a user in social network and review information is calculated by using the tags and comments of the UGI. The final result is to calculate the measurement of quality score of image and adding one more features in proposed model using fuzzy logic that calculates the matching percentage.

abstract={Proliferation of the electronic devices that are portable leads to various power manageable techniques. Dynamic voltage scaling is the effective power management technique for properly managing the limited available battery source. Steady state operation and dynamic range of voltage regulation are the key challenges while implementing the DVS technique. This DVS technique utilizes the dc-dc buck converter for power management because of its higher efficiency. PID compensator plays a vital role in deciding the stability of the system. So proper tuning of these parameters are mandatory for obtaining a stable closed loop system. The closed loop configuration of this buck converter and the controller is first implemented in C programming language using integer representation and then it is converted into a behavioural model in verilog HDL. The functional and timing simulation of this design is done by using Altera Quartus II simulation tool. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Cold-formed steel built-up sections are commonly used as compression elements to carry larger loads and longer spans when a single individual section is insufficient. For such cases lapping of two sections at the interior support is done to maintain the continuity of the beams. Connections are an important aspect of such structures since structural behavior, and hence economy, is dictated to a large extent by the behavior of the connections. There are numerous types of fastenings between cold formed steel components. However, where holes are punched during forming, bolts are by far the most common type of fastener used in practice. This paper describes about the structural behaviors like buckling modes, maximum load carrying capacity and other possible modes of failure of the whole members under static loading at the lapped area. Two separate beams are taken and lapped with bolts to form a single continuous beam. The two lapped cross sectional C-shaped sections are made with varying cross sectional area. Totally three beams with lapping distance varied between them are tested. Finally the experimental results are compared with numerical analysis using ANSYS.},

abstract={Nano particle formulations, especially protein based formulations are great drug delivery systems for a targeted and sustained drug release. The Specificity lies with the receptor-ligand binding mechanism adopted by them. Metformin hydrochloride (MET) is a widely used biguanide oral antidiabetic agent, against Type II diabetes. In its free form, it suffers some shortcomings like poor oral bioavailability for its site specific absorption and frequent dosage administration requirement for its short half life. With a vision of troubleshooting these drawbacks, we developed a novel protein based, 'casein-MET micelles' delivery system. It is a sustained drug delivery system that involves a very simple and reliable method of using sodium caseinate for entrapping MET. These synthetic micelles were characterized by their particle size distribution, zeta potential, polydispersity index. The morphological and physicochemical characterization was done by using Scanning electron microscopy and FTIR spectroscopy, which was further validated by in-vitro drug release evaluation. This method produced very fine and stable casein-MET micelles with a uniform rod shape of average 1.2μm size. In-vitro drug release behavior of casein micelles suggests that about half of the drug is released during first 3h and 85% of the drug is released after 15h of its administration, which could be a great improvement of the existing methods.},

abstract={This paper illustrates the behavior of concrete beams reinforced with uniaxial and biaxial geogrids. The use of geogrids in concrete setup a new dimension for employing geosynthetics in structural engineering. Geogrids are being used in providing stabilization, confinement, and reinforcement of asphalt concrete layers, further to reduce reflective cracking in pavement applications. The purpose of examining the behavior of geogrids in structural members gives opportunity to observe benefit and feasibility of using geogrids in thin concrete layers. The experimental investigation consists of testing 8 geogrid concrete beams and 2 control beams under two point bending. The two point bending test on geogrid beams reveals that strength of geogrid and number of layers plays a crucial role in enhancing load–deformation behaviour and flexural strength. Test results indicate that geogrid can be used as an alternative material for steel in structural members. © 2015, Sphinx Knowledge House. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Fly ash based concrete is a developing construction material in which fly ash is partially substituted for cement. The use of GFRP as reinforcement in concrete structures is also considered to be a possible substitute to steel in those situations, where corrosion is possible. This paper evaluates the comparison of bond strength (BS) of fly ash replaced concrete (FAC) with sand coated GFRP bars and that of ribbed steel bars. Pull-out test is performed in accordance with IS: 2770 (Part I) – 1967. Tests were carried out on cube specimens and the BS of the various mixes of FAC was compared. The compressive and tensile strength of FAC is compared with that of ordinary cement concrete. The test parameters were Fly Ash replacing cement at 0%, 15%, 20% and 25% and also various diameters of reinforcement bars of GFRP and steel bars used during the test. The diameter of the bars were kept as 16mm and 20 mm diameter. The fly ash replacement is of the order 0%, 15%, 20% and 25%. The embedment length was kept as a constant of 140mm. The conclusive results of the tests indicate that if the diameter of the bar increases, the bond strength also increases. For 25% replacement of cement using fly ash, yields equal bond strength of the Ordinary Portland Cement. © 2015, Sphinx Knowledge House. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Concrete is the most commonly used material for construction. The world wide the production of one tonne of cement emits CO<inf>2</inf> gas which results in a lot of environmental pollution. There is need for the alternative materials which are finely ground solid that has to be used to replace the portion of cement in the concrete mixture. In this work the supplementary materials such as lime, metakaolin, brickdust were used in the 100% replacement of cement in the mortar mixture. To study the influence of pozzolanas and chemical composition of the different materials is important to know the behaviour of the alternative supplementary materials. The specimens were casted to investigate the strength properties of lime-based pastes without any aggregates. In our work nine different sets of pastes with additions of metakaolin and brick dust were used to study the mechanical properties of the mortar. The different combination of mortar paste has casted and cured in water for 28 days curing period. To study the chemical composition of the materials XRD analysis is done for lime, brick dust and metakaolin samples. To study the mechanical properties of the mortar the compressive strength and tensile strength test has been studied.

abstract={In this project the attempt was made to use of laterite sand as a fine aggregate in concrete. Sand is demanded ingredient of concrete which is costly too due to availability. Laterites are rich in silica and it is a locally available material of low cost.The major advantage is that it can be replaced with fine aggregate in concrete. The physical properties of laterites are investigated namely specific gravity, particle size distribution and density. The specific gravity of cement, sand, laterite and coarse aggregate are 3.1, 2.6, 2.55 and 2.7 respectively. Uniformity coefficient (Cu) and coefficient of curvature (Cc) of laterite is 4.375 and 1.09 respectively. The quantity of laterites varies from 0 percentage to 100% at interval of 25 percentage in this study. The 1:1.5:3 mix of concrete is used for determining the mechanical strength and durability characteristics. The density of laterite mixed concrete increases when percentage of laterite increases. The results of laterite sand mixed concrete is compared with conventional concrete. At 50 percentage replacement of sand by laterite sand produces high compressive strength. The tensile and flexural strength increases when the percentage of laterite sand increases. While 28 days of HCL acid curing, the compressive strength decreases. The compressive strength decreases after curing when percentage of laterite increases. As a result of sorptivity test the water absorption increases, when the percentage of laterite sand increases. © 2015, Sphinx Knowledge House. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In this scientific world, nowadays various researches achieved the strength of the concrete, by replacing various alternates in the place of conventional natural aggregate (i.e., natural coarse aggregate and natural fine aggregate) so as to preserve the environment, leading to sustainable development. The exposure on recycling aggregates and M-sand (Manufactured sand) plays a vital role in the field of construction. As the price of sand and natural coarse aggregate is increasing day by day the usage of these alternates founds to be cheaper and it provides additional strength as compared to the conventional concrete. In this study, the wastes from various constructions are used in an optimum manner. A special chemical admixture Conflax which is a high range water reducer is used, that can create a desired slump for a low water-cement ratio. In this experimental study, the physical and mechanical tests are carried out in accordance with respect to the Indian standards. Concrete samples of M-20 grade prepared as IS-10262, 2009 mix design procedure with and without replacement of recycled aggregates and M-sand. The mix is performed by addition of 0%- 0%, 50%-50% and 100%-100% of RCA and M-sand as same for the conventional mix. The compressive strength of concrete is determined by casting around 150x150 x150 mm cubes then they are cured under constant room temperature and finally they are tested for 3,7 and 28 days. This experiment results that strength about 50-50% replacements of RCA and M-sand reaches the maximum strength about 23.96% than compared to the conventional concrete. Also, the cost for conventional natural aggregate and alternate aggregate i.e., RCA and Msand are discussed in this study. Hence the usage of RCA and M-sand are recommended as an alternate material to achieve the Optimum strength with optimum percentages of quantity mix. © 2015, Sphinx Knowledge House.

abstract={With today’s competition, organisations are facing challenges from the economic, social, and scientific environment, workplace environment, and never-ending expectations of customers. To win over these situations requires a learning organisation that has the capability to adopt, renew, and energise itself to match the changing and challenging environment. This study analyses the level of learning of individuals and the organisation, which in turn influences the performance of a private-sector bank. The study used a questionnaire to collect the primary data based on the theoretical framework developed by Watkins and Marsick (1993). For the purpose of this assessment the researchers used regression analysis and the partial least squarestructural equation model (PLS-SEM). The analysis throws light on the fact that there exists association between the learning organisation and the bank’s performance. A leading, established, private-sector bank in south India has been taken as a sample study for understanding how the concept of a learning organisation has helped the bank to improve its performance. © W.

Methods: The ethanolic extract of Ervatamia divaricata. L. Burkill was subjected to preliminary phytochemical screening and the antitumor effect of EEED was assessed by employing in-vitro methods. Compounds present in the ethanol extract of the plant were identified using GC-MS (Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) and attempts were made to understand the mechanism of action using insilico methods. Results: The results of the in vitro cytotoxicity assay and MTT assay revealed the anticancer potential of the ethanol extract of Ervatamia divaricata. When different concentrations of EEED were assayed, the dead cells were found to increase with increase in concentration of the extract. This proved that there was considerable damage of the cell membrane that leads to the blocking of the cell signaling in cancer cells. Conclusion: The present study revealed that EEED possessed significant antitumor activity against EAC. © 2015, International Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Science. All right resurved.},

The ash from the low cost precursors were treated with NaOH solution and sonicated for a period of time. The silica recovered as sodium silicate, by filtration, from each raw material is compared and analyzed. In general, when sodium silicate is treated with acid, different amorphous and mesoporous silica are produced. The silica gel was synthesized using the acidification of sodium silicate solution.Silica recovery was promising based on the comparison of the silica content before and after the process, with silica fumes having the highest recovery of silica. Thus the sodium silicate from the raw material silica fumes was used in the preparation of silica gel using acidification method and then analyzed. The modified recovery process proves to be a promising method for the recovery of silica from natural sources.},

abstract={Providing security for the message during transmission is a thought-provoking task. To accomplish this goal many cryptographic and steganographic algorithms are being used. Cryptographic algorithms transform the original message into a cipher text before transmission, whereas the basic idea used in Steganography is to hide the existence of the message in a media. This enables the existence of secret data to be known only to the authorized sender and the receiver. In this paper a newfangled method based on clustering and noise addition is proposed to enhance the security of the hidden data. The proposed method consist of two steps. In the first step the pixels of the cover image are grouped into different clusters using k-means clustering algorithm which is followed by the embedding process. In the Second step a random noise is added to each pixel in all the clusters. Experimental results are compared with existing steganography techniques, which shows the proposed algorithm not only achieves same embedding capacity but also enhances the PSNR of the stego image. © 2015 M.

abstract={Wire mesh is a form of reinforcement that differs from conventional reinforcement primarily by the manner in which the reinforcing elements are dispersed and arranged. The well distributed and aligned reinforcement has made wire mesh to behave like steel plates. As concrete is weak in tension the tensile stresses in flexural member is resisted by steel reinforcement. Hence in this project presents about an experimental investigation done on beam prototype made of reinforced concrete overlaid by a thin section of wire mesh over the main reinforcement. The major parameter studied in this project were type of wire mesh varied in spacing of interlocks. The entire beams prototypes were tested using two point loading system. Test results clearly indicate that the use of wire mesh layers as an additional reinforcement significantly enhances the flexural strength, cracking behaviour and energy absorption capability. Obtained results are compared with the control specimen. The test results show that the use of wire meshwith closely spacing provides the higher energy absorption capacity and flexural strength and decreases the crack width among those concrete beam specimens. The results obtained from this work is expected to be useful in determining the strength, energy absorption capacity and crack width. © 2015, Sphinx Knowledge House. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Corrosion being a great drawback in steel, even though using of steel bars as reinforcement in concrete structures has not been reduced since there is no alternative replacement. Glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) bars are now being considered as a replacement for steel in concrete beams. Due to insufficient study, there is no clear view for using GFRP as reinforcement in concrete beams. In this study two concrete mixes were considered, one as conventional mix (M25) and the other as high strength mix (M50). A high range water reducing admixture (HRWRA) is used in both the mixes which showed better compressive strength and tensile strength than the mixes without admixture. Both the mixes had test parameters like longitudinal steel and GFRP bars, with shear reinforcements as steel and GFRP. Totally 6 beams were tested using a two point loading system and the flexural behaviour was observed. The results showed that GFRP when used as transverse reinforcement showed high initial stiffness when compared to steel. The theoretical values are finally compared with the test results and discussed. © 2015, Sphinx Knowledge House. All rights reserved.},

The solution is using void formers, in this case spherical shaped. Finite element analysis is performed using ANSYS software on 6 specimens in which 3 are solid and others voided. The slab specimens were of dimensions 1500 × 1500 × 100 mm with symmetric boundary conditions. The void diameter is taken as 70 mm, with a wall thickness of 1 mm and is assumed to be made up of HDPP. The clear spacing between the voids are varied between 30, 50 and 70 mm. The voids with a spacing of 30 mm proves to be more efficient because even though removes 20% of concrete, the deflection shown by the specimen is near to that of solid slabs. The results from finite element analysis is compared with that of plate theory which is used to compute reference values of deflection for corresponding load. The maximum deflection observed for V30 slab was 19.52 mm by numerical methods. © 2015, Sphinx Knowledge House. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Concrete Filled Steel Tube (CFST) columns were taken in to an account because of its greater strength and malleability recital contributed by the composite action. At early elastic stage this composite action cannot be absolutely developed as the expansion of steel was quite more than that of concrete. This in turn, creates deficient interface bonding between the composites. Thus, it cut down the elastic stiffness and strength of the CFST columns. To overcome this lacuna in the initial elastic stage, provision of shear connectors was carried out to reduce the lateral dilation of the concrete core and steel. In this experimental work, CFST columns of assorted proportions, with shear connectors were tested for push out tests and axial compression. A mix design for M40 grade of concrete was adopted, in order to increase the workability of concrete. A chemical admixture, High Range Water Reducing Admixture (HRWRA) was used in the mixes which showed better compressive strength. The behavior of the admixed CFST columns with and without shear connectors was analyzed. From this experimental investigation, it had been observed that: (1) the provision of shear connectors increased the bonding of interface by about 17%, which in turn helped to achieve higher axial load-carrying capability (ranging from 17.5% to 18.3%) and reduction in axial shortening of CFST columns. (2) The ductility of CFST columns were improved by shear connectors. (3)The lateral deformation of the steel tube and the core concrete at the placement of shear connectors were limited effectively. © 2015, Sphinx Knowledge House. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Sterile implants and devices should be introduced into any animal body, in order to avoid nosocomial infection which can subsequently cause implant failure and serious illness. Unsterile implants can become lethal to the host system. Hence, it is highly mandatory to achieve ‘sterility’, the absence of all living organisms such as virus, bacteria, yeasts and molds. There are numerous techniques to sterilize implants. Sterilization using Moist heat (autoclaving), Dry heat, Ethylene Oxide (EtO), Chlorine dioxide, Ozone (O<inf>3</inf>), Vapor phase Hydrogen Peroxide (H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>), Low temperature gas plasma, Glutaraldehyde solution, Formaldehyde, Peracetic acid and Radiation [Machine generated X rays, Gamma rays, Universal homogeneous ultraviolet (UHUV) rays, Accelerated electron beam] are some of the techniques frequently used. Each method has its own effect on the implant’s characteristics. Since sterile conditions should be maintained till the time of implantation, it is wise to consider sterilization-related issues at the earliest, during the implant development process, so that more economic and readily sterilizable product is achieved. This review paper discusses some sterilization techniques and their effect on the implants sterilized, along with their advantages and disadvantages. © 2015, Sphinx Knowledge House.

abstract={Steel rebars undergoing corrosion play a major role against durability of reinforced concrete components. This project investigates the viability of using externally bonded glass fiber sheet along with cementitious composites to rehabilitate beam members with corroded rebars. Steel rods were corrodedthrough alternate wetting and drying condition. Following the corrosion phase, twelve reinforced concrete beams were cast and grouped as B1, B2, B3 and B4. The beam members were strengthened and repaired externally. Three control beams of B1 were cast without any repair to corroded rebars and without any strengthening. B2 beams were cast without repair of corrosion but they were strengthened externally with fiber sheets using cementitious composites. In group B3, rebars were applied with protective epoxy coating and strengthening was carried out. Procedure in B4 was similar to B3, except epoxy was used as binder for fiber sheets. Four point bending test were carried out on all beams and results were compared. Flexural behaviour of beams showed that the effect of strengthening in corroded beams increased the ultimate load carrying capacity, stiffness and energy absorption. Percentage increase in ultimate load for beams B2, B3 and B4 are 20.9%,66.16% and 75.72%s compared with beam B1. Wrapping in beams reduced the deflection. Percentage decreases in deflection are 10% for B1, 20% for B2 and 35% for B3 respectively compared to beam B1.Percentage increase in stiffness is 14.2% for B2, compared with control beam B1.Similar improvement in percentage of stiffness is noted as 74.9% and 121.8% for B3 and B4 respectively. Energy absorption in B2 is enhanced by 47.02% compared with control beam B1.Whereas beam B3 and B4 shows 77.33% and 107.6% increase in energy absorption respectively.Present strengthening technique using cement based composites as binder is found to be efficient, similar to epoxy binder in retrofitting reinforced concrete members with corroded bars. © 2015, Sphinx Knowledge House.

In recent days of bio refinery, HMF plays an important role in the production of fuels and other value added chemicals. HMF is present in day to day foods like milk, coffee, roasted nuts and sliced bread. Fructose, fast dehydrating sugar, is the preferred raw material for the maximum production of HMF (95.5%). Production is carried out in the presence of solvents and catalysts. Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO) and 1-butyl-3methyl imidazolium tetra fluoroborate together increases the yield of HMF to 80%.

abstract={High Performance Lightweight Concrete (HPLWC), could be considered as a combination of high performance concrete and structural lightweight concrete. In the present work HPLWC was produced by two ways. One was using air entraining agent and the other was using light weight aggregate (expanded clay). In the former case, air entraining agent was added as additive in different percentages and in the later case the coarse aggregate was partially replaced with different percentages of expanded clay as light weight aggregate. In both the mixes, cement was replaced partially with ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) and Metakaolin (MK) in two different percentages. In total there were eight different combinations of mixes were studied at three different ages of concrete namely 7, 14 and 28 days of concrete. Among the different mixes prepared, compressive strength of concrete with 0.4% air entraining agent with 10% metakaolin and 30% GGBFS yielded better compressive strength. Similarly, when expanded clay of 25% used as light weight aggregate with 12% metakaolin and 28% GGBFS gave the better results. Comparing results of both, HPLWC produced with air entraining agent found to be better than that of concrete produced with light weigh aggregates. © 2015, Sphinx Knowledge House.

In present work, an experimental study was made to study the strength of SCC using metakaolin (MK). Here cement was replaced by MK with 15%. For an experimental investigation, conventional vibrated concrete CVC and SCC cube and cylinder specimens were cast and tested at the age of 28 days after curing. The concrete mix design was developed using ACI code provisions for conventional and SCC type concrete. With the obtained results, it was found that compressive and split tensile strength of SCC specimens found to be higher compared to CVC.

abstract={In the present scenario the cost of binder (cement) used in the construction has increased alarmingly leading to the increase in construction cost. To minimize the cost of construction, concrete made with various mixturesof Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC)with diverse mineral admixtures as partial replacementof cement is the dire necessity of the day.This research wok focuses to observe the effect of Silica fume (SF) and Metakaolin (MK)mixture as a partial replacement of cement in concrete.Cubes cast with chemical admixture i.e., Superplasticizer (SP)gives better results than with the normal mix. This paper elaborates the influence of partial replacement of OPC by SF (6%, 7.5% and 10%) and MK (10%, 12.5% and 15%) by weight in M25 and M50 grade concrete with SP. Compressive strength at the end of 7 and 28 days is carried out on cubes of various mix proportions of SF and MKas partial substitution of cement for different Water-Binder (w/b) ratio as 0.3, 0.35 and 0.4. Optimum mix proportion is obtained from the compressive strength test results. Beams are cast for the optimum mix proportion to determine flexural behaviour. It is found that all the mixes with the inclusion of MK and SF have improvement in strength over that of the control mix.From the experiment it is found that the mix (MK+SF)-5 has remarkable increase in strength by 43.8% and 13.8% over the control mix for M25 and M50 grade respectively. © 2015, Sphinx Knowledge House.

abstract={This paper presents the behavior of ternary blended concrete made using ceramic powder obtained from waste ceramic tiles and micro silica in aggressive environment involving H<inf>2</inf> SO<inf>4</inf> and NaCl curing mediums. Waste ceramic tiles were collected and were ground to ultra fine size using dry ball mill and the sizes were checked with X-Ray Fluorescent (XRF) to bring a fine powder with size less than that of cement particles. The ground ceramic powder was added in 4, 9 and 14 percentages by weight of cement to obtain a high strength concrete mix of M50 grade. Micro silica was also added in the mix in a small percentage of 1% by weight of cement to accelerate the early age strength making the mix ternary blended. To find the rate of deterioration cube specimens were cast and cured in water for 28 days and then in diluted H<inf>2</inf> SO<inf>4</inf> and NaCl for a period of one month. Resistance to water absorption was also studied by casting cylinder specimens. The exact percentage of ceramic powder that can be added with the OPC (Ordinary Portland Cement) to provide enough resistance to deterioration and water permeability were identified. Concrete with ceramic powder 9% and micro silica 1% provided enough resistance to deterioration both in acid and base medium. In resisting water absorption the mix which contained 14% ceramic and 1% micro silica showed better resistance to water absorption. © 2015, Sphinx Knowledge House. All rights reserved.},

However applications will become a reality when efficiencies become greater than 20% of Carnot Efficiency. The requirements for a domestic refrigeration system are: simplicity, reliability, COP and low cost. With an objective of developing an alternate refrigeration system for water cooler application at 13oC with a capacity of 80 W, a simulation program to quantify the performance of a Stirling type Orifice PTR is developed with nitrogen as the refrigerant and performances are predicted for the PTR. At 274 K, the refrigerating effect predicted is 12.689 W, whereas the experimental value is 11.57 W, a difference of around 9%. Experiments conducted on the PTR developed is analysed for feasibility of applications in a water cooler. A maximum refrigerating effect of 30 W is obtained for a net power input of 497 W, the COP being 0.06 at 390 rpm of compressor speed and charge pressure of 9 kg/cm2. A Stirling type OPTR coupled to a One TR open type refrigeration compressor using Nitrogen as the working fluid operating at 4 kg/cm2 can be developed for a 10 lts/hr water cooler. A low cost oil free open type reciprocating compressor can make the Pulse Tube Water Cooler a reality. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={This work propose a three stage device known as Multi-Fed Power Electronic Transformer(MFPET) which can be used in distribution system instead of conventional transformer due to its flexibility in voltage transfer ratio, low harmonic distortion, high density of power and so on. The input stage consists of two ac/dc rectifiers which are connected to two different sources or feeders. The input stage also employs outer voltage controller and inner current controller. Since the two rectifiers are back-to-back connected, power demand can be shared between the two feeders. The second stage consists of DC/DC converter with a high frequency transformer. The high frequency transformer in the second stage is used to provide galvanic isolation. The third stage consists of DC/AC inverter which provides desired power and voltage to the RL load. The MFPET model is established in MATLAB/SIMULINK software. The simulation results show that the power demand was shared among the feeders. Thus it enhances the flexibility of distribution system and it will contribute to the concept of smart grid. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={In this paper Nonlinear Constellation Precoding (NCP) with Subcarrier Grouping for MIMO-OFDM systems has been proposed. MIMO-OFDM system transfers frequency selective MIMO channel into number of parallel flat fading MIMO channel. Linear Constellation Precoding (LCP) technique is generally adopted to mitigate the multipath diversity in OFDM systems. In subcarrier grouping full group of subcarriers are divided into subgroup of smaller groups, thereby reducing the complexity of decoding. In this paper, LCP technique is replaced by the NCP technique which provides better BER performance when compared with the LCP technique. NCP technique with MIMO-OFDM system hikes the data rate when compared with the OFDM system. BER performance of NCP- OFDM and NCP MIMO-OFDM systems with subcarrier grouping is simulated and compared with simulation results. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Insulation system in rotating machines plays a vital role. Degradation of the insulation system leads to premature failure. Partial Discharge is not considered as the main cause of the failure of insulation but it is considered as the initial cause of the failure of insulation. This paper proposes a method to diagnose the condition of the insulation. A copper bar conductor with varnish impregnated cotton tape, used in large rotating machines is considered as test specimen. High Voltage in steps is applied to the specimen first in increasing order and then in decreasing order. For a particular voltage the maximum magnitude of Partial Discharge pulses was recorded. A graph relating voltage and PD magnitude was plotted and it was observed that a curve similar to hysteresis curve was obtained. An idea about the insulation condition and residual life can be predicted from the area enclosed by the up curve and down curve. A larger area can be inferred to as a bad condition of insulation which may require corrective action and a comparatively smaller area can be inferred to as good condition of insulation. PD measurement being a non destructive method can be efficiently used for insulation condition assessment of rotating machines. In this work an attempt is being made to measure the PD occurring in an insulated copper bar specimen. The experiment was repeated with simulated faults in the insulation and hysteresis curves were plotted. It was observed that area enclosed by the curves was different for good specimen from that of a fault simulated specimen. © Research India Publications.},

These systems use FPGA modules and it is desirable to have web enabled remote Graphical User Interface (GUI) for these complex FPGA Modules. This proposal develops web GUI using ALTERA Nios Fast Core processor in an efficient manner using System on Chip (SoC) mode. Existing proposals in the literature used SoC for this purpose. However, these proposals either port the webserver on the embedded software running in SoC mode or use CGI script to implement the webserver logic and these proposals are inefficient with respect to SoC performance. The current proposal uses socket interface to provide network connectivity between the host system and the embedded software system running in SoC mode. Socket Protocol provides flexibility to implement linux/windows as host and the minimum server functionality is implemented on the Nios-f Processor. The HTTP browser writes the configuration file, data is read from the file and whenever the data is modified client (host) transfers the data using socket protocols in an efficient manner without closing the file. The precision of execution is verified through the HTTP page withset operation which sets input value to leds on the FPGA Board and with get operation which reads displayed led data to the HTTP page in windows/linux host system. © Research India Publications.},

The maximum power is drawn from the photovoltaic panel using the maximum power point tracking technique (MPPT). The algorithm used for Maximum Power Point technique is perturb and observe (P&O) method and it is implemented using the fuzzy logic controller (FLC). When sunlight is available, photovoltaic panel supplies power to the DC load. When PV panel becomes inactive i.e. at zero irradiation, the battery starts supplying power to the DC load. A DC-DC converter which works in bi-directional mode is used for charging and discharging the battery. The converter acts in buck and boost mode while charging and discharging the battery. Thus, the DC load gets continuous power supply without any interruption maintaining a constant DC voltage across the resistive load.

It is used for predicting the state of a system in association to a suite of sensors and other measurement devices.It estimates the future behavior of a system based on a series of past behaviors. It is used to its full potential mainly in object tracking and guidance of vehicles and inertial navigation systems. Several object tracking methods focus only on improving the detecting mechanisms but not on the performance parameters of the kalman algorithm itself.In this paper, a new method to increase the overall speed of the kalman algorithm is proposed where the multipliers are reduced by employing multiplexers. This increases the speed of the system since the total number of multiplications are reduced considerably. This also decreases the amount of energy consumed making it suitable for implementing it in hardware creating a suitable. Then this device is implemented on hardware to create a dedicated kalman filter module © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Digital images are corrupted by impulse noise mainly due to sensor faults of image acquisition devices and adverse channel environment which in turn degrades the image quality. A decision based switching median filter (DBSMF) to restore images corrupted with high density impulse noise is proposed in this paper. The global use of standard median filters for impulse noise removal from corrupted images provide good results but the filtering operation may affect fine pixels in addition to noisy pixels which leaves a blurred effect on the filtered image. In order to address this issue the proposed algorithm makes use of an efficient detection scheme to identify the noise pixels and noise free pixels. The detection algorithm clusters the pixels in the corrupted image so as to fall under three categories which states whether the pixels are corrupted or uncorrupted. The proposed switching median filter processes only on those pixels that are classified as corrupted and replaces the processing pixel by the median value. Under high noise densities the filtering window consists of more number of corrupted pixels. For such cases, the proposed algorithm restricts certain conditions on the expansion of the filtering window size to effectively choose the median value. The performance of this decision based algorithm is tested against four noise models for different levels of noise densities and is evaluated in terms of performance metrics which include Peak Signal to Noise ratio (PSNR) and Image Enhancement Factor (IEF). It gives better results for images that are extremely corrupted up to 90% noise density and outperforms classic filters in terms of handling image corruption. © 2015 Hindustan University.},

abstract={Hydrogen sulfide is an important endogenous signaling molecule which can play a key role in regulating blood pressure, cardiovascular and age-associated diseases. But it is extremely toxic if inhaled and can even cause death at higher concentrations. This work reports a systematic investigation of template and catalyst free grown ZnO nanorods through simple chemical spray pyrolysis technique and their room temperature hydrogen sulfide sensing characteristics such as sensitivity, selectivity, stability, response and recovery times. The structural, morphological, optical and electrical properties of ZnO nanostructures were investigated using X-ray diffractometer (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), UV-Vis spectrophotometer and electrometer respectively. The role of density of nanorods formed on the glass substrates through spray cycle modulation has been used as an effective tool for achieving better sensing response. ZnO nanorods with the diameter ranging from 200-250 nm exhibited high selectivity towards hydrogen sulfide and the mechanism has been reported. The challenge of selectivity has also been solved efficiently through ZnO nanorods. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

We exploit enhanced ring signatures to preserve the identity of the signer. With this the identity of the signer on each block in shared data is kept private by utilizing tokens.

abstract={The emergence of modern digitization has resulted in versatility to eradicate the divergence among the forms of information travel flanked by the users. This paper presents a pliable approach for the erratic block size selection in an impulsive mode to boost the level of sophistication in stego algorithm. An ingrained formula for key exchange, suggested in the algorithm combines the benefit of cryptography adjoining with steganography. In contrast to the usual implementations using generic software and personal computers, the suggested software development has been intense on an embedded device LPC 2378 with the RISC architecture that includes extensive support for networking through on-chip modules supporting ethernet and CAN protocols. The focal plan of this work includes elimination of key exchange for data encryption and improving the security to a massive level without compromising the image quality and embedding capacity. This endeavor shows the aptness of embedded hardware for stego implementations using an image carrier that makes soaring demand on memory; the extremely inhibited resource of embedded devices. The efficiency of the algorithm in maintaining image quality has been measured using the metrics MSE and PSNR. The enhancement in performance of embedded software, in terms of speed and code size have been analyzed under sophisticated compiler tools from KEIL MDK and IAREW. © 2015 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

abstract={Cognitive radio is the technology that helps overcome the problem of scarcity in a spectrum. It has its application in empowering a secondary user to gain entry into the spectrum. This admittance is because of detection of unoccupied part of the spectrum. It can boost up the spectrum utilization. The sensing technique utilizes the energy detection method, one of the many available. Being the simplest form, it checks the spectrum for empty slots by comparing the energy present with a predefined threshold. The result of this is not satisfactory under noisy conditions. To enrich the detection; the fixed threshold should be made differential i.e., adaptive or other kind of threshold should be employed. In this work with simulation results it has been proved that detection is better with adaptive threshold and further enhanced by the incorporation of multiple energy detectors. © 2015 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

abstract={The chemical compositions of ceramic powder and micro silica were checked with XRF and were found to be satisfactory as both micro silica and ceramic powder possess chemical components related to cement. A high strength concrete of M50 grade was made using ceramic powder obtained from used or broken tiles at 4, 9 and 14% replacement levels and micro silica at 1%, both by weight of cement. The strength after 7 and 28 days curing were checked and was found that the blended concrete initially showed less strength but reached 65% of the desired mean strength. Control concrete strength was found to be more after 7 days curing. The blended concrete started showing increased strength at later age from the 28th day. Concrete with 9% ceramic powder and 1% micro silica showed better strength-increase from 7-28 days. It is understood that addition of ceramic powder and micro silica contributes to later age strength development. The microstructure of the concrete for various compositions were also checked using SEM and it was found that the C9+MS1% combination showed dense packing of concrete with the presence of C-H (Calcium-Hydroxide) which contributes to strength development. © 2015 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

abstract={Image enhancement plays a vital role in the field of digital image processing since the noise is added very often with the original image. Spatial filtering techniques like low pass, high pass, band pass and notch with the help of convolution mask are often used to enhance the image with reduced noise. Recently, morphological algorithms play a major role in the area of filtering noise, boundary detection, shape detection, image manipulation, etc. Especially by applying dilation, erosion, opening and closing to the image appropriately, the quality of the image can be further enhanced. In this study, morphological algorithms are being applied to remove the salt and pepper noise from the input image. Erosion followed by dilation and dilation followed by erosion are the main methods to remove this kind of impulsive noise. MATLAB software is used to apply these opening and closing methods to enhance the quality of the image with difference structuring elements. Simulation results are obtained and the comparison is done with the performance metrics like Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Normalized Correlation Coefficient (NCC) and Image Enhancement Factor (IEF) with different structuring elements. © 2015 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

abstract={Signal processing applications have become very popular due to the use of digital filters. Among digital filters FIR filters are opted due to its stability and response which is finite. In this paper a low power and high speed FIR filter is designed. The filter is pipelined which will reduce the critical path. So high speed is achieved and consumption of power is reduced. Then parallel processing of the filter is done which duplicates the hardware. Hence many outputs can be calculated in parallel which will increase the speed of the filter. Canonical signed digit (CSD) representation is used in which the numbers of non-zero coefficients are reduced. This will decrease the transitions hence power consumption is less. The designed filter is simulated in Modelsim-altera 10.1d and synthesized in Xilinx ISE 13.2. © Research India Publications},

abstract={Wind energy conversion system (WECS) is generally connected to the electric power grid which supplies electric power to supplement the base power from other generation systems using fossil fuel or nuclear energy. Induction generators are mechanically and electrically simpler than other generator types used in WECS. These are particularly suitable for wind generating stations as in this case speed is always a variable factor. To extract maximum power from wind energy, ANFIS control technique is used. The main goal of ANFIS controller is to continuously adapt to the rotational speed of the generator with the wind speed in a way that the turbine operates at its optimum level of aerodynamic efficiency. To compute the crisp values from the fuzzy values, weighted average method is used for defuzzification. The direct and quadrature voltage components are calculated using ANFIS controller and are applied to the generator. The desired rotor voltage in the rotor reference frame generates switching signals for the rotor side using space vector. © Research India Publications.},

The healthy motor and fault motor models have been generated based on the rotating reference frame. Generally five types of fault occurs in stator winding which are Coil to coil, turn to turn, line to line, coil to ground, line to ground, if there is taking inter turn fault model based monitoring the fault The stator winding inter-turn fault occurs due to change in voltage, current and stator resistance in a dynamic load when used in industrial application. Analysis of motor faults showed that the stator winding fault isa common fault which could result in damaging a motor and could stop the motor from running efficiently. If this stator winding fault can be detected and isolated early enough the life period of the motor can be increased and it is achieved using state space model. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Block based Visual Secret Sharing technology is one of the advanced technologies for image encryption scheme, in which human visual system is used to recover the encoded image. In our proposed system, images are decomposed in to different shares and added with a fixed value in the interval of 0/1s. Thus it will make all shares in to similar sizes. Blocks are not expanded in the existing system, though they achieved 50% as their image quality. Hence in our paper, quality of image is improved when comparing to the existing system. Security of the image also enhanced by using DES Rijndael Managed technology to scrambled the pixel values. Similarly in the decryption process, same security features will be used to construct the image from different blocks. Therefore, security of image transmission is ensured. The main advantage of the paper is (i) image can be partitioned as much as possible, (ii) both gray scale and color image can be used, (iii) contrast of the image shares also improved to give good visual ability to the human eye. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={In the Recent years Power Quality issues have become important in practise as well as research. Power quality can be considered as proper characteristics of the supply voltage, reliable and effective process of delivering electrical energy to consumers. Many customers may experience severe technical and economical consequences of bad power quality disturbances such as voltage fluctuations, flicker, harmonics and unbalance leads to improper operating of appliances and some industrial process shutdown. On the other hand such phenomena appear in the power system more often because of the systematic growth in number, power of non linear and frequently time variable loads. In the condition for the technical and economical reasons ensuring good power quality is necessary. hence application of compensating equipment has increased. The evolution of power electronic devices implements the use of FACTS devices. FACTS devices are used for upgrading Power quality and reactive power compensation of high voltage AC transmission lines. In this project, Three Level Neutral point clamped voltage source inverter based STATCOM are connected to the Power system network. Neutral point clamped (NPC) multilevel inverter(MLI) is now proven technology for high-power, medium/high voltage applications. Despite its several advantages such as harmonic reduction, reduced stress across switching devices, and achieving high-voltage and high-power capabilities without problematic series–parallel connections of switching devices, NPCMLI has an inherent problem of voltage fluctuation across dc-link capacitors due to load unbalancing, nonuniform distribution of charges, and nonidentical properties of dc-link capacitors and switching losses. Unbalanced dc-link voltage results in distortion in the inverter output and also require large size capacitance. To maintain constant dc link voltage and achieving voltage regulation at the point of common coupling, Hysteresis controller (Non Linear Controller) is implemented and Multi carrier PWM Technique is used for STATCOM based on NPC-VSI. Various carrier-based PWM techniques are presented using MAT lab Simulink, which can minimize the THD and enhance the output voltages and the results are analysed. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Apart from nutritional value, fish food is considered as the high foreign exchange earners world-wide. Since fish food is highly perishable, histamine production in fish due to improper storage temperature causes allergic reactions like histamine toxicity (scromboid toxicity). Hence, accurate estimation of histamine in fish food has become a serious concern. In this context, to design a histamine biosensor with less error, high accuracy and specificity, the interdependent electrochemical parameters such as histamine concentration, cathodic peak current, electron transfer rate constant, amount of charge consumed, surface coverage and full width at half maximum of cathodic peak height were related to improve the efficiency of the GCE/CeO<inf>2</inf>-PANI/DAO modified electrode. The multivariate analysis such as principal component, hierarchical cluster analysis and multiple linear regression techniques were done with the estimated value of electrochemical parameters and it showed that the cathodic peak current, amount of charge consumed, surface coverage and full width at half maximum of cathodic peak height were highly related to the histamine concentration, whereas the electron transfer rate constant has no relationship with other electrochemical parameters. Finally, the combination of the Hill model with the multiple linear regression model effectively improved the specificity and accuracy of the histamine biosensor.

abstract={Staphylococcus aureus is a common pathogen seen in prosthetic vascular graft, leading to high morbidity and mortality. The virulence genes for severity of infections are under the control of global regulators. Staphylococcal accessory regulator A (SarA) a known master controller of biofilm formation is an attractive target for the drug development. A structure based screening of lead compounds was employed for the identification of novel small molecule inhibitors targeted to interact to the DNA binding domain of the transcriptional activator, SarA and hinder its response over the control of genes that up-regulate the phenotype, biofilm. The top-hit SarA selective inhibitor, 4-[(2,4-diflurobenzyl)amino] cyclohexanol (SarABI) was further validated in-vitro for its efficacy. The SarABI was found to have MBIC50 value of 200 μg/ml and also down-regulated the expression of the RNA effector, (RNAIII), Hemolysin (hld), and fibronectin-binding protein (fnbA). The anti-adherence property of SarABI on S. aureus invasion to the host epithelial cell lines (Hep-2) was examined where no significant attachment of S. aureus was observed. The SarABI inhibits the colonization of MDR S. aureus in animal model experiment significantly cohere to the molecular docking studies and in vitro experiments. So, we propose that the SarABI could be a novel substitute to overcome a higher degree of MDR S. aureus colonization on vascular graft. © 2015 Arya, Ravikumar, Santhosh and Princy.},

abstract={Cloud computing is set of resources and services offered by the Internet. Cloud computing provides its consumers to access virtualized hardware, scalable, distributed and software infrastructure over the internet. Load balancing is the method which is used to distribute the task among multiple computers. Hence overload can be avoided and can achieve minimum data processing time, optimal resource utilization and minimum average response time. The existing Throttled Load Balancing (TLB) algorithm exhibits some drawbacks. To overcome the drawbacks in TLB this paper proposes an efficient scheduling algorithm, which can support the load balancing and can provide better improved strategies through efficient job scheduling, modified resource allocation techniques and reduce the power usage and context switching between the servers. Enhanced Throttled Load Balancing Algorithm provides improved results to Throttled Load Balancing Algorithm. © 2006-2015 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).},

abstract={Relapse of tuberculosis, typhoid and various other infectious diseases after remotion of antibiotics is attributed to the presence of ‘persisters’ in the bacterial population. This phenomenon is referred to as ‘persistence’; often in conjunction with multicellular like biofilm complicates the treatment of infectious diseases. Persistence is a non-heritable trait as the progeny cells are as sensitive to antimicrobial agents as their ancestors. In the recent past several breakthroughs have shown that several factors induction heterogeneity of a bacterial population. Of this Toxin Antitoxin Systems (TAS) are better understood to mediate metabolic reduction and induce non dividing state of a small fraction of bacterial population. These cells, referred to as persisters, are tolerant to even high concentrations of several antibiotics. The factors involved in the regulation of TAS are thought to be stochastically activated which in turn activate different TAS to induce slow growing state. Biomolecules like ppGpp, inorganic polyphosphate and various proteases like Lon are involved in TA system mediated bacterial persistence. In this review, recent developments are summarized with a focus on possible targets to counter the persistence phenomenon. © 2015, Sphinx Knowledge House. All Right reserved.},

abstract={Melatonin is a natural hormone found in a variety of living organisms, including plants, and possesses the potential to act as a growth promoter and stress alleviator. The present study aims in understanding the effect of melatonin in Catharanthus roseus (C. roseus; medicinal plant used in anticancer therapy) leaf extracts for enhanced silver nanoparticle synthesis. Our results indicated that the supplementation of 300 μM melatonin to C. roseus leaves improves silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) synthesis. The phytosynthesized AgNPs were characterized using UV-Vis spectroscopy, FE-TEM, Zetasizer, XRD, AAS and FTIR spectroscopy. Moreover, the AgNPs were found to be smaller in size (ranging from 10-25 nm) with potent antibacterial activity (MIC and MBC values against the most prevalent urinary tract pathogens, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, being 15.6 ± 0.0 μg mL-1 and 31.25 ± 0.0 μg mL-1 respectively). Furthermore, LC-MS/MS analysis of the melatonin treated C. roseus leaf extracts indicated the presence of significant biomolecules; 6-acetyl morphine (used as an analgesic), rauwolscine and fisetin (anticancer compounds). Melatonin treatment of C. roseus leaves also enhanced its antioxidant potential and total chlorophyll content. Thus, melatonin serves as a potential agent to improve C. roseus growth and therapeutic potential. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.},

abstract={Objectives: The present work was carried out with a view to analyze the major phytochemical compounds of Indian spices, cumin (Cuminum cyminum L.), fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum L.) and fennel (Foeniculum vulgare Mill.).  Methods: Hydro-alcoholic (30% ethanol in water, v/v) extracts were prepared from selected spices and analyzed for extract yield, loss on drying (LOD), pH and phytochemical compounds such as total alkaloids, phenols, flavonoids and tannins were quantified by spectrometric methods. High performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometer (GC-MS) techniques were employed to reveal the phytochemicals of selected spice extracts.  Results: Hydro-alcoholic extracts from selected spices revealed the pH to be 5.36-5.62, loss on drying (12.54–15.41%) and extract yield (8.62–29.19%). Among the investigated samples, higher levels of alkaloids (2.032%) and tannins (0.809%) were found in fenugreek while fennel exhibited highest content of total phenolics (3.39%) and flavanoids (2.621%). The hydro-alcoholic extracts were subjected to HPTLC analysis and the results suggested the presence of three different major phytochemical compounds in cumin and fenugreek, whereas fennel extract displayed only one major peak. Cumin, fenugreek and fennel extracts showed relatively similar spots with Rf values of 0.51, 0.62, 0.90 and 0.97, which indicates the presence of four similar type of flavonoids in each extract. Presence of some volatile compounds in extracts was identified by GC-MS analysis.  Conclusion: Due to the presence of various phytochemical constituents and favorable extract yield, LOD and pH, the presently investigated spice extracts could be used in drug formulations. © 2015, International Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences.

abstract={Purpose - Glass fibre reinforced plastics (GFRP) contain two phases of materials with drastically distinguished mechanical and thermal properties, which brings in complicated interactions between the matrix and the reinforcement during machining. Surface quality and dimensional precision will greatly affect parts during their useful life especially in cases where the components will be in contact with other elements or materials during their useful life. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the application of the Taguchi method with fuzzy logic to optimise the machining parameters for machining of GFRP composites with multiple characteristics. Design/methodology/approach - The machining tests were performed on a CNC milling machine using solid carbide (K10) End mill cutting tool with three different helix angles. Experiments were planned using Taguchi's orthogonal array with the cutting conditions prefixed. Findings - The machining parameters, namely, helix angle of the end mill cutter, spindle speed, feed rate, depth of cut, and work piece fibre orientation (specially applied to the GFRP composites) were optimised with considerations of multiple response characteristics, including machining force, material removal rate, and delamination. The results from confirmation runs indicated that the determined optimal combination of machining parameters improved the performance of the machining process. Originality/value - Multi-response optimisation of machinability behaviour of GFRP composites using fuzzy logic has not been attempted previously. © 2015 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Incompatible interactions of polymers with active chemical entity offer variable challenges in drug delivery kinetics. This study focuses on development of hybrid polymer blend nanoparticles with amphiphilic (Poly Vinyl Pyrrolidone) and hydrophobic (Ethyl cellulose and Eudragit RSPO) polymers to encapsulate maximum drug without significant incompatibility. Optimized nanoparticles developed using Acyclovir model drug exhibited 80% entrapment with size and surface charge of 100 nm and +26 mV, respectively. Spherical morphology and solid state transition of drug from crystalline to amorphous in nanoparticles was confirmed by SEM and XRD analysis. pH independent in-vitro drug release was observed in four different media with initial burst release followed by sustained release for >12 h. Statistically significant difference (P < 0.05) was observed in percentage of drug release from each formulation in different media. H-bonding and hydrophobic interactions between drug and polymer (FTIR, TG-DTA analysis and Makoid-Banakar Kinetics) and diffusion of drug from matrix nanospheres followed by pore transport were the key factors for effective drug release kinetics. Uptake of nanoparticles by corneal epithelial cells was more prominent within 30 min, however viability of cells was not altered significantly. Release kinetics and interactions studies revealed the suitability of polymer blend nanoparticles for better encapsulation and sustained release of the drug. © 2015 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers.},

abstract={This paper deals with the role of the Static Synchronous Compensator (STATCOM) in enhancing stability of the power system combined with Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) based off-shore wind farm. The STATCOM is employed to maintain stable voltage and also to improve the power quality. The use of STATCOM is recommended in systems with large loads, where the reactive power consumption from the grid could cause serious effects on the connected loads. In this work, design of suitable controllers is proposed to improve the stability of the overall system. A Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) Controller and the Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) are designed for the purpose of controlling the operation of the STATCOM and vary the reactive power supply according to the voltage level at the PCC. Simulation work of the proposed scheme is carried out using MATLAB/Simulink. It is observed from the obtained results that the STATCOM with FLC has the improved characteristics to enhance the operation of a multi machine system fed by a DFIG based Offshore Wind farm. © Research India Publications.},

The ultimate aim of this project is to reduce the low frequency oscillation (0.2-2Hz) (i.e.) local plant mode and inter plant modes of oscillation. The role of power system stabilizer has become really common in the mental process of heavy electric power system. The dominant generator can be determine by using Eigen value analysis.

abstract={In the recent years, the addition of series capacitors in to the transmission lines are increasing to get better transmission efficiency. The inclusion of series capacitors incur serious problem in the entire power system. One such problem is the self excited oscillations of the capacitors. Whenever this oscillation interacts with the Generating Station there is the possibility of the occurrence of Sub-Synchronous Oscillations in the system. These oscillating frequency is in the range of about 10Hz to 40Hz. Due to the Sub-Synchronous oscillations the turbine Generator shaft may get damaged, repeated stress over the shaft results in the shaft failure. An Induction Machine can be used as a damping unit to control this oscillations. An attempt has been made to reduce the peak torques aroused due to the addition of series capacitors in the system. The peak torques are reduced by the tight coupling of the Induction machine with the turbine- generator shaft. The results are obtained using the IEEE First Benchmark Model using MATLAB Simulation. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Switching devices such as relays and circuit breakers in power systems create voltage surges. Implementation of power electronics devices also creates repetitive voltage surges. Such repetitive fast rise time voltages of relatively higher magnitude upon reaching the stator winding of rotating machines tend to degrade the insulation of such machines. The voltage surges created by the switching devices may lead to excess electrical and thermal stresses on the stator winding insulation leading to premature failure. In this work a surge generator circuit along with PD measurement circuit incorporating direct detection method was implemented. Partial Discharge was measured for four different stress levels on stator insulation of a low voltage induction motor with and without rotor. It was observed that PD measured without the rotor was less when compared to the PD measured with the rotor inserted. Hence it was inferred that the PD test without the rotor will result in under qualification of the motor for operation under transient surges. Further the rotor was positioned at 3 different positions with reference to stator and was tested for PD. Significant changes were observed in the PD pulse patterns. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={In present competitive world data is everything. Man and machines interact with each other just because of this data governing them. People have subtle time to gather data from the vast spread domain. To overcome such time spares scientists have evolved easy data structures to club data together, which most of us know as Data Set. These data sets have an implicit factor of relationship by themselves, which many of us have rarely admired. There is indeed a narrow stream of literature that has tackled this aspect. To further gear the accelerator, this paper proposes a technique called Multi Domain Fuzzy Cluster (MDFC) to club data sets into bags of Densely Related Cluster, Loosely Dense Related Cluster and Strongly Densely Related Clusters. As the data set taken for study are fuzzy in nature, it is working for a dependency matrix and fed as an input along with the classical dependency matrix to understand the club pattern.

The best method to increase the network lifetime is to keep some sensor nodes in alive mode and remaining in sleep mode. The proposed approach consists of two methodologies: (i)Competitive Heuristic method and (ii)Ad-hoc on Demand Vector topology. Competitive Heuristic method is used for identifying the alive node with higher number of neighbor nodes using Euclidean distance, the fast iterative heuristics method is used to refine the number of active node. The Ad-hoc on Demand Vector topology is used for finding the shortest path with minimum cost. Also, it helps in reducing data loss during transmission, irrespective of failure data can be transmitted in alternative path. By these techniques, network lifetime and performance can be increased and also data loss during transmission can be avoided. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={This paper uses PI controller to control the speed of BLDC motor fed by a SVPWM inverter. Brushless DC (BLDC) motors have a wide range of applications because of their higher effectiveness and simple control procedures. In BLDC motor just two phases are supplied and the third phase is kept off. These two stages are to be supplied, which is resolved on the basis of the rotor position. Taking into account the position of the rotor, switching devices in the inverter are commutated for each 60 degree. Rotor position sensors are utilized to sense the position of the rotor at each moment of time. For controlling the output voltage and frequency of the inverter, Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) techniques are utilized. Sinusoidal PWM and Space Vector PWM (SVPWM) are the most recently utilized techniques. Sinusoidal PWM is the least complex and most utilized PWM methods, yet it has some drawbacks. The recently invented Space Vector PWM technique overcomes these setbacks, for example, it lessen switching loses, harmonic content in the output, better usage of accessible dc-transport voltages. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={This work is to preserve the distortion of marked image from the original image, that is, to improve the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and to improve the Embedding Capacity (EC). Pixel-Value-Ordering (PVO) is the technique used for ensuring reversibility in Reversible Data Hiding (RDH). The difference-value is calculated from ordered pixel blocks. From the difference-value histogram, the rough bins are shifted to vacate place for concealing secret whereas the smooth bins are expanded to conceal secret. The proposed Novel Reversible Pixel-Value-Ordering Technique (RPVOT) is the containment of two schemes: Novel Difference Computation (DC) and Novel Histogram Shifting (HS). Firstly, for DC, the existing approaches compute the difference between first two (or, last two) pixel values of an ordered block whereas, the novel DC technique picks up the first two pixel values (or, last two pixel values) from an ordered block and the rounded mean of pixel values in minimum and maximum position subtracted from a pixel value in minimum position is computed. This novel DC makes eligible more number of blocks for secret concealment than other existing approaches by which more secret bits can be concealed and visual worth of the marked image is conserved as well. Secondly, novel HS is proposed which break the rule of shifting all the blocks that are not meant for embedding by shifting some blocks using naturally occurring empty bins in the histogram. This novel HS prevents many blocks from unnecessary alteration in their pixel values and hence, visual worth of the marked image is improved further. Both novel DC and novel HS are combined together to form novel RPVOT which significantly improves the Embedding Capacity (EC) along with Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR).},

abstract={Artificial neural networks (ANN) a sub-field of intelligent systems, are widely employed to resolve a diversity of civil engineering problems. In the present paper, using data from literature ANN models (ANN-A, ANN-B & ANN-C) was modelled to predict the compressive strength of concrete, having different mixtures at different age of 1, 3, 7, 28, 56, 90 and 180 days. The model ANN-(A) inspects eight and ANN-(B) & ANN-(C) examines 7 different parameters that comprises: sand (S), metakaolin (MK), superplasticizer (SP) ,aggregate (A) , silica fume (SF), cement, water, and time, respectively. Artificial neural networks take robust prospects for prediction of compressive strength of concretes containing silica fume and metakaolin which is recognized by validation, testing and training results. This strength prediction will aid the cement factories in manufacturing the cement, which when used in concrete will results in required concrete strength. © 2015, Sphinx Knowledge House.

abstract={The suitability of replacement of natural aggregate (NA) with recycled aggregate (RA) mainly depend on the properties of recycled aggregates. The presence of loose mortar particles and surface cracks result in inferior aggregate properties. This experimental study presents a surface treatment method which enhances the properties of coarse recycled aggregate. In this study, recycled aggregates were treated by soaking in hydrochloric (HCl) acid at 0.1 M concentration. The basic properties of RA before and after treatment and its effect on concrete were examined. The results show that the behaviour of RA has improved after treatment. Usually there will be 10-30% decrease in the strength value of recycled aggregate concrete when compared with natural aggregate concrete. The strength improvement can be achieved in a much better way by using the treated recycled aggregates in concrete than untreated recycled aggregates. © 2015, Sphinx Knowledge House.

abstract={Glass fibre reinforced polymeric (GFRP) composites are used in various applications such as aircraft, marine and automobile industries because of their high specific strength, high specific stiffness, light weight, corrosion resistance and non-magnetic properties. They also replace traditional materials in many critical applications. Nonetheless, the machining behaviour of GFRP material is still a challenge to the researchers due to its complicated interaction between fibre and matrix material. On machining, this kind of material suffers by surface delamination, fibre peel up, fibre push up, fibre pull out, fibre fracture, and matrix breaking. With an objective to minimize delamination, an investigation was carried out on Chopped Strand Mat GFRP (CSMat GFRP) material by studying the effects of drill diameter and drill diameter ratio besides spindle speed and feed rate. The experiments were designed by L<inf>18</inf> Orthogonal Array and conducted by using standard High Speed Steel tools. The obtained results were analyzed by Signal-to-Noise ratio and Analysis of variance. Based on the Signal-to-Noise ratio analysis, drill diameter of Ø8mm, drill diameter ratio of 0.8, spindle speed of 3000rpm and feed rate of 50mm/min were identified as optimal parameters for drilling CSMat GFRP material with minimum delamination. The ANOVA table results reveal that drill diameter, drill diameter ratio, spindle speed and feed rate have shown statistical significance on delamination. © 2015 Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.},

During the transmission of digital images as a cover media for hiding a secret data into it will lead to some distortions in the cover image while retrieving back due to the data embedding. Reversible data hiding technique extracts both the carrier image and the cover image. Recently, there are many techniques used for reversible data hiding. This paper deals with hiding an image using either SMVQ technique or by image inpainting technique. Both of these techniques show a better performance for image hiding in the compression domain .On the transmitter side, the sender can use any of the technique for compressing and hiding the secret image. The embedding process takes raster-scanning order for residual blocks and it leaves the top most and the left most blocks of the image. At the receiver side, the image decompression and extraction process takes place to retrieve the secret image.

abstract={Electrical energy usage is increasing day by day and to meet out the increased load demands, the installation of distributed resources has increased in distribution networks considerably. As a consequence, there is a possibility of rise in fault current level which impose more stress on the power system components and a possibility of abnormal operation of the power system network during fault instants. To solve such problems the safety measures such as replacing the existing Circuit breakers, changing the operating mode of the systems has been proposed. To cope with the increased fault current level limitation, introduction of a promising power apparatus namely active type super conducting fault current limiters (ASFCL) is one of the viable solution from both technical and economical point of view. In this paper active type SFCL has been modeled and its fault current-limiting and voltage dip mitigation characteristics are simulated in MATlab-SIMULINK. The simulation results reveals that the active type-SFCL can mitigate the voltage dip and fault current effectively, thus preventing the equipment’s from fault currents and improving the system safety and reliability. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={The audio signals are frequently affected by a non-linear distortion called harmonic distortion. The non-linear distortion may occur due to any of the amplifier components such as diodes, transistor etc. The presence of harmonic distortion in audio signals degrades its perceptual quality and makes the sound very harsh to hear. Audio signals can be analyzed using various transform techniques. Wavelet analysis is appropriate for analyzing audio signals since it is well suited for analyzing non-stationary signals. An approach using wavelet packet decomposition is suggested to remove the harmonic interference. At a particular constraint condition, the wavelet packet decomposition coefficients correspond to harmonic interference in each subband become constant, which can be exposed as a baseline. By shifting the baseline back to zero the harmonic interference can be removed. The effectiveness of the approach is justified by estimating peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) for various audio signals.

abstract={This paper proposes a type of multi-level Inverter which converts the dc into ac using less number of switches when compared to conventional multilevel Inverters. However instead of a DC source, Solar cells,(i.e) photo voltaic cells or PV panels are installed. Among the renewable energy sources, PV is a light, clean, and easily installable resource. These PV panels convert the energy from sunlight and give it to the circuitry. But the conventional MLIs such as Diode Clamped MLIs requires extra diodes in conjunction with the active switches, Flying capacitor MLIs requires extra Capacitors and control also difficult if the levels increases and the Cascaded H-bridge MLIs requires separate dc sources which limits its use. This paper proposes a new type of multi-level Inverter which converts the dc into ac using less number of switches when compared to conventional multilevel Inverters.The proposed Inverter can be used to integrate the system into Grid, while satisfying the grid requirements such as phase angle, frequency and amplitude of the Grid voltage.

abstract={Proliferation and self-sufficiency are two of the most important properties of cancer cells. Although genetic aberrations are believed to be the reason for cancer development, the importance of metabolic alterations in cancer development has been in the lime light lately. The most challenging aspect in cancer treatment has been the similarity to host cells. The discovery of various metabolic alterations that occur in cancers to attain and maintain a proliferative state has resulted in new information on the metabolic differences between normal and cancer cells. One such alteration is the establishment of the Warburg effect. This review elaborates on various changes that lead to the establishment of the Warburg effect in cancer cells and their consequences. Understanding the metabolic uniqueness of various cancers can aid in the identification of novel molecular targets leading to more efficient strategies in cancer treatment. © 2015 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={This deals with conceptual study of power quality improvement during voltage sag and swell on the power distribution network. Traditionally AC voltage is governed by tap changer in transformer or employing an AC-AC convertor system, recent development in AC-AC convertor builds feasible in implementing an voltage regulator through different analysis. In this paper AC voltage controller with buck-boost arrangement is analyzed. The primary objective of this project is to control the voltage and injecting the reactive power to the line is proposed. There is no need for multistage conversion. Fault analysis on various cases are also studied. This includes single phasing of different line at different faulty condition. Even there may be an occurrence of increase in voltage at receiving end which is known as Ferranti effect this effect can be compensated by AC voltage controller in distribution end. The proposed methodology of proportional-integral (PI) controller approach is carried in the closed-loop system. An assess in stability condition on the zippy and limp modes and adequate large mode interval rate can assure that the closed-loop system accomplishes the desired properties to maintain the desired output voltage in the system. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Many electronic equipments which are used in airspace craft, robotics, personal computers require switched mode power supplies (SMPS) with fully isolated and controlled multiple outputs. In conventional cuk converter based SMPS, the presence of input diode bridge involves the conduction of more semiconductor switches resulting in more conduction losses and decayed thermal management. So modified cuk converter is used as a topology for SMPS to enhance the power quality. Modified cuk converter is a bridgeless PFC rectifier which acts as AC to DC rectifier with cuk converter as topology for SMPS. The proposed modified cuk converter based SMPS works in continuous conduction mode in order to achieve low Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) and enhanced power factor. A comparative study has been done between modified cuk converter based multiple output SMPS and conventional cuk converter based multiple output SMPS based on results obtained from circuit simulations in MATLAB Simulink software. The comparative study is mainly done in order to prove that power quality is enhanced using the modified cuk converter and it has better efficiency than the conventional CUK converter. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={This paper emphasis the combination of Thyristor-Controlled Reactor (TCR) and Shunt Hybrid Power Filter (SHPF) in PQ problems for mitigation of harmonics and reactive power consumption in the distribution system. The term Shunt Hybrid Power Filter denotes the combination of Passive filters and Active Power Filters. The combination of the TCR and the passive filter is technically termed as Shunt passive Filter which helps to improve the power factor by compensating the reactive power. The Active Power Filter is to mitigate the harmonics in the source current and to inhibit the hypothesis of resonance between the Shunt Passive Filter (SPF) and the line inductance. The TCR is controlled using proportional-integral controller and the corresponding triggering alpha value is educed from the lookup table to control the reactor value in the TCR. The Active Power Filter (APF) is controlled using non-linear control strategy. The simulation of the above model is carried out in MATLAB Simulink software for star and delta connected TCR and the %THD level of the source current is made to retain below 5%, which satisfies the IEEE-519Standard. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={We explored whether copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) can function as an efflux pump inhibitor and as an anti-biofilm agent. Our results showed that at 0.5× (0.065 mM) Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC), CuNPs exhibited remarkable efflux inhibitory effect in wild type strains of both Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and less but significant efflux inhibitory effect against MRSA and drug resistant mutant strains of Staphylococcus aureus. At 1× MIC (0.13 mM) concentration, they significantly inhibited monoculture biofilms formed by Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Membrane permeability, membrane integrity and confocal imaging provided insight into the mechanism of the antibacterial effect of CuNPs. Efflux inhibition and antibacterial effect of CuNPs was partly mediated by particle effect and partly by ion effect. A novel efflux pump inhibitory role for CuNPs is reported in our study. Proof of concept experiments revealed that CuNPs could reverse the MIC of the mutant Staphylococci aureus strain for ciprofloxacin by 4 fold (from 64 μg ml-1 to 16 μg ml-1), hence our study reveals that CuNPs could be potentially employed as bacterial adjuvants to curtail Multi Drug Resistant (MDR) bacteria.

abstract={In recent times, the introduction of harmonics due to the presence of Non-linear loads affects the power quality in distribution systems. The objective of this paper is to improve the power quality by using a shunt active power filter (SAPF), to reduce the current harmonics injected in the source side from the load side. In this paper, voltage source inverter (VSI) acts as a filter which is connected parallel to the load through a reactor which is fused. Shunt active power filter eliminates the harmonics by intruding harmonic current into the line with equal magnitude and different phase to that of load current harmonics. SAPF using different control strategies such as Instantaneous Real and Reactive Power (IRP) theory, Synchronous Reference Frame (SRF) theory, Current Source (CS) Scheme and Power balance (PB) Scheme are introduced for harmonic mitigation, with same load conditions and different current controllers. When a nonlinear load is connected to the system, harmonics gets introduced in the supply side due to the nonlinearity. Therefore, it is necessary to minimize the Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) of the source current. Based on the minimization of source current THD, the performance of different control strategies with different controllers is related and the results of simulation are examined using the SIMULINK model. © Research India Publications.},

The Hybrid multilevel inverter topology is introduced with a reduced number of switches to improve the multilevel performance. The project proposes a hybrid CHB multilevel inverter. It uses a simple cascaded H-bridge structure and was developed. This topology consists of a full-bridge with four bidirectional switch.

abstract={Nanotoxicology is an important field that has started to unravel the adverse effects of nanoparticles. The major emphasis is on developing strategies to reduce the toxicity of nanomaterials. Chemical transformations of metal nanoparticles have been suggested to be an important method of mitigating nanoparticle toxicity. In the present study, we investigated the toxicity of copper and copper sulfide nanoparticles in a zebrafish model using a series of biomarkers of toxicity. The exposure of zebrafish to copper nanoparticles enhanced the oxidative stress of the liver, altered the detoxification enzymes and affected the brain acetylcholinesterase activity. However, the exposure of zebrafish to sulfidated copper nanoparticles rescued these parameters. Histopathological analyses of the liver and metallothionein levels also support the significance of sulfidation as a potential mechanism for controlling copper nanoparticle toxicity. More importantly, micronucleus formation was significantly reduced in the liver of fish exposed to sulfidated copper nanoparticles when compared to non-sulfidated nanoparticles. The presented biochemical data provides strong evidence for a reduction in the toxicity of copper nanoparticles when it undergoes chemical transformation as copper sulfide. © 2015 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

By doing this, the transformation function will depend on the intensity of the pixels of the edges which are detected. This method improves the low contrast area in the image and does not enhance the brighter area in the image. This method avoids excessive enhancement of the image. Experimental results shows that entropy is better for sub image edge based histogram equalization than standard histogram equalization. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={This paper presents a speed control of Permanent Magnet Brushless DC Motor (PMBLDCM) fed from a Bridgeless (BL) Buck-Boost converter for low-power applications. A speed control approach is implemented by varying the dc-link voltage of voltage source inverter (VSI). Instead of many number of sensors, a single voltage sensor is employed to enhance the performance of PMBLDC motor wherein the DC-link capacitor voltage of an inverter has been governed. This facilitates the operation of an electronic commutator with reduced switching losses. Also, the Bridgeless configuration of Buck-Boost converter which operates in DCM mode reduces the conduction losses and hence the cost. The Voltage follower approach of Buck-boost converter controls the DC-link voltage or the terminal voltage which in turn controls the speed of the motor. The mathematical modeling of proposed Permanent Magnet BLDCM drive is designed, and its performance is analysed by using MATLAB. The Simulation results are manifested to demonstrate the wide range of speed variation of PMBLDCM since it has become an evolutionary trend of day-to-day life. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Cognitive Radio is one of the recent trends for increasing the usage of spectrum effectively. Sensing is one of the major tasks of cognitive radio where the availability of vacant channels in licensed bands should be detected and utilized by a secondary or cognitive user in the radio spectrum. Two stages of sensing based on Energy Detection (ED) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) are considered for detecting the unused frequencies. Combining the advantages of both the technique to increase the probability of detection with no knowledge about the received signal is the goal of two stage sensing. The limitation of energy detection to perform in high noise is overcome by SVD, so that the overall performance for sensing is increased. Simulation results also indicate the increase in detection probability with respect to signal to noise ratio than single stages of sensing. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Contrast enhancement is an important area in the field of image processing which brings out contrast in images. To enhance contrast in images, histogram equalization (HE) is performed which stretches the dynamic range by calculating the probability density function (PDF) and the cumulative density functions (CDF). The drawback of HE is that, it alters the overall brightness of the image. Due to this drawback, a new method of HE is discussed which segments the histogram of the original image and controls the brightness level. In this study, the histogram of an image is segmented based on exposure threshold. The obtained sub histograms are subdivided based on the median value in to four sub histograms. Then, by calculating the clipping threshold the histograms are clipped to minimize over enhancement in images. Finally, equalization can be done by computing the transfer functions obtained for the sub images and integrating the sub images into single image. Simulation results demonstrate that, the proposed HE method is compared for various test images by computing peak-signal to-noise ratio (PSNR) using MATLAB. © Research India Publications.},

The multiple outputs of the SMPS are +12V,-12V,+5V,-5V for PC applications. To obtain nearly unity power factor and reduction in total harmonic distortion (THD) of input current, the SMPS with buck-boost converter based topology is designed to operate in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM). DCM operation gives added advantages of improved power factor and reduced switching losses and reduces the complexity of circuit operation. The presence of only two switches in the current conduction path during each switching cycle and the absence of diode bridge rectifier results in reduced conduction losses and an improved power factor, as compared to the conventional SMPS. Performance comparisons between the bridgeless buck-boost topology based PFC SMPS are performed based on MATLAB/Simulink simulations. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Importance of p-type transparent conducting oxide (TCO) is much needed in the optoelectronics industry. Due to lack of intrinsic p-type TCO, it is necessary to design or tune the properties existing n-type TCO are very essential. This present work describes, n-type ZnO is tuned to p-type by doping of nitrogen on to the nanocluster. The structural stability of Zn<inf>x</inf>O<inf>x-1</inf>N for x=(2-5) is optimized using Gaussian 09 program package with a B3LYP/6-31G level basis set. The optimization result shows that when the cluster size increases the stability also increases. The dipole moment depends on the structure of the Zn<inf>x</inf>O<inf>x-1</inf>N cluster. These optimized structural geometries are used to calculate the binding energy, HOMO-LUMO energy gap, ionization potential and electron affinity of nanoclusters. The binding energy for ring structures is found to be more than the other two structures. Vibrational analysis is carried out for all the structures and reported. The ring structure is found to be more stable than the linear and 3D structures. The findings of the present work will provide an insight to synthesis, p-type ZnO nanoclusters. © 2015 VBRI Press.},

This paper, presents a secured data transformation by blending Steganography and cryptographic techniques together to improve the standard of data security such that none other than the intender and the receiver will be able to extract the proper data. The integer wavelet transformation is used to transform the data into an unintelligible format. Transformed data are embedded using least significant bit substitution into the cover image. The intensity of the pixel range which is frequent in image is selected and infixing of data is done on this selected range of pixels. This process is also reversible. This improves the efficiency in secured transmission as it approaches different patterns each time the same data embedded in different images. This algorithm can be best utilized to encrypt passwords and keys which are transmitted by 3rd party.

abstract={Stock market is a place where the companies mobilize money from the people to run their business and in turn benefit people in terms with dividend and profit. Stock market has been an aggregation of both buyers and sellers. As the stock market value increases, the market capital of corresponding firm increases and thus benefiting the investors. Sometimes there may be a chance of downfall in their business which will cause the investors to lose their investment. If the company is not running successfully, the stock price may go down. The reason for investing in the stock market is to earn more profit in a short period of time. Plenty number of stock market shares are available in the existing market. People always find difficulty in choosing a right company shares for their investment. It's a right time for us to make some big analytics, to guide the investors on where to invest their hard earned money. For analysis, umpteen numbers of methodologies are available at our disposal. Two of the methodologies like K-Medoids (Crisp) and Fuzzy K- Means (Soft Computing Techniques) are employed for market analysis. We propose 'BAR Model architecture' for stock market analysis using three layered segments where acronym BAR refers to Budget, Analysis and Result. Budgeting is an entry level to identify the class in the data set. On applying distributed measures on a given data set we get what is called as Budget. After applying the above said methodologies what we get is called Actuals. Both Budget and Actual were compared for variance using Chi-square and ANOVA Test. As the variance we get is very minimal it proves that either methodology is not needed for this kind of application. We come to the conclusion through this paper that the Budget proves to be right. Purity levels of the attributes were measured through Gini Index. This innovative approach will lead us to achieve Predictive Accuracy and Reliability. For the past one decade, this kind of mammoth data collection and analysis have never been reported which has been accomplished in this paper. © 2006-2015 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).},

abstract={Hydrogels are crosslinked polymers which has the ability to absorb water in aqueous media. Hydrogels are being prepared by different methods such as suspension polymerization, chemical or physical crosslinking, solution polymerization, radiation polymerization etc., and using different types of polymers. Hydrogels exhibiting swelling mechanism have been extensively used as drug carriers in the controlled drug delivery systems. The wide application of these biomaterials is due to its characteristics such as swelling in the aqueous environment, specific response to the pH, temperature, ion, electric stimuli sensitivity etc., Hydrogels of biocompatible polymers have good loading capacity and so widely used for the encapsulation of drugs which can be targeted to the specific sites. Since the rate of drug diffusion from hydrogels can be controlled, these materials are potentially useful as drug delivery systems. Controlled release of many drugs including anticancer and antiviral agents has been efficiently done using hydrogels. Especially various anti-HIV drugs have been successfully formulated as hydrogel systems for the controlled release and prolonged action. Bilayer and multilayer hydrogels have grown importance in recent days, wherein a burst release followed by controlled release could be achieved for superior therapeutic action at reduced dose and side effects. Also the efficiency of incorporating more than one drug in different layers of hydrogels is being investigated to improve combination therapy for various disorders. © 2015 International Journal of Drug Delivery Technology.

abstract={Oligomerization of amino acid monomers is the vital step in the formation of longer peptides and functional proteins. In spite of continuing efforts towards solving the puzzle of origin of life, the mystery of chemical evolution remains unsolved. Out of various pathways proposed for the formation of peptides under prebiotic conditions, salt induced peptides synthesis presents the most plausible scenario. In attempts to study mechanism of prebiotic oligomerization of amino acid on primitive earth the current study was aimed to determine the crystal structure of intermediate copper amino acid complex and its supra-molecular assembly. The Structure of the copper alanine complex obtained from SIPF was studied by x-ray crystallography. The self-assembling properties of complex into supra-molecular nanostructures were studied using Field-emission electron microscopy (FE-SEM). Results showed the occurrence of racemization of amino acids. This is the first structural study for copper alanine complex formed from prebiotic peptide synthesis pathway. The aggregational properties of intermediate complex showed the formation of rod like crystals and nanospheres. The findings from our study showed the possible mechanism of prebiotic oligomerization of amino acids on the primitive earth towards formation of longer peptides and functional proteins. © 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

abstract={The Presence of noise in digital images gives an unpleasant vision and it often becomes a barrier for machine vision systems to analyze or process the images. An improved trimmed median filter to restore the images that are extremely corrupted by impulse noise is proposed in this paper. In proposed algorithm, the filtering is incorporated with a noise detection scheme so that the noise pixels alone are processed and the clean pixels are retained. If the centre pixel is found to be corrupted, it is replaced with the trimmed median value which is obtained by eliminating all 0s and 255s in the selected window. At high noise densities, the median of the previously processed pixels is considered for replacing the processing pixel in addition to certain restrictions on window expansion. The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested against four impulse noise models and compared with the performance of the standard median filter in terms of image metrics which include Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Image Enhancement Factor (IEF). © Research India Publications.},

In India both Hindustani and Carnatic music which is considered as classical music is constructed with lot of rules and properties to show its efficiency in expressing the feelings and emotions in human life. The computational aspect of Carnatic music is used to represent raaga, identify swara, detect raaga of a song and identify singer. The way of rendering, elaborating and identifying the Carnatic raaga by the musicians are different on the basis of their own style. There is no specific method or model to render the music concerts as well as no defined methods available for identifying the raaga of a given song. We have arranged the steps involved in the process of finding raagam of a song or alaap (elaborating raaga without lyrics). The various domains of computer science like data mining, fuzzy logic, artificial neural networks and algorithms can be utilized to produce more information from raagas. In this paper, we examine the unique characteristics of Carnatic raaga and the various methods of identifying the raaga that have been utilized for the purpose of retrieving Musical Information. © Research India Publications.},

The optimal LC filter, C-type filter is used as a passive filter (PF) and voltage source inverter (VSI) is used as an active power filter in HPF to minimize voltage total harmonic distortion (THD) and current THD. Synchronous reference frame (SRF) algorithm is used to obtain the fundamental signals for hysteresis controller.

abstract={High data rate became the primary requisition in this fast growing world. In the area of wireless communications, a trending new innovation, MIMO(Multiple-Input Multiple-Output) has been introduced. MIMO has taken far superior steps in terms of data rate and minimum Bit error rate by using multiple antennas at the transmitter and receiver sides when compared to Single-Input Single-Output(SISO). In this paper, various transceiver designs of MIMO over the past 12 years have been studied. Several performance measurements have taken into consideration like weighted minimum mean square error (MMSE) and minimum bit error rate (BER) to obtain a optimum precoder or linear transceiver structure. In addition, convex and nonconvex optimization techniques have been adopted to get optimum transceiver designs. These techniques has been employed to Improper signal constellations and observed a superior performances. At last, more realistic per antenna power constraints are being considered over Sum power constraints.

So, for better representation of object classes by shapes, the proposed algorithm pays much attention towards contour. The proposed approach observes the human action and identifies the similarity using contours. The approach does the computation by identifying the actors, compute and compare the contours. The proposed approach is validated with KTH, UCF and UT datasets.

abstract={Identification and segmentation of chemical bond images is important in computer aided diagnosis. In this paper, two chemical bonds were secured for superpixel based linear clustering, is proposed. In the clustering, histograms from contrast enhanced image channels and centre surround statistics from centre surround difference bonds are proposed as features to determine each superpixel as information or bonded structures. In the initial step, to handle the unbalanced cluster issue due to the presence of unbalanced images, bootstrapping is done. The proposed method has been tested on two bonds namely propanol and methoxyethane images with its boundaries marked by image processing techniques. The results also show a decrease in overlapping error as the reliability score is reduced. The method can be used in computer aided diagnosis systems to enhance the bonding structure for clinical deployment of the automatic segmentation. ©2015 RASĀYAN. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Rice (Oryza sativa L.), has been used for consumption as staple food for over 5000 years and it is classified under Gramineae or grass family. About 2/3 of the world‟s population is under its sprawl and has transiently adapted to various environments. Environment, soil and variety are the key determinants for chemical composition of grains. There are considerable cultural differences and opinions in the determination of quality preferences in rice grains. Quality evaluation of rice includes chemical composition, cooking and eating quality, gelatinization temperature and/or the physical properties of cooked rice evaluated using sensory tests and physico-chemical parameter determination. As of present scenario, the consumers are transforming their priorities for unpolished rice especially towards traditional rice simply because of the nutrient content in the bran and rice. Hence, the demand for brown and parboiled rice is in increasing trend among the consumer sections. In the present study, we have evaluated the rice grain quality characteristics (physical, chemical and cooking) of few selected traditionally cultivated rice varieties and fuzzy logic has been applied to determine combination of best palatability traits which promote cooking and eating quality preferences. Depending upon the context, fuzzy logic could be applied to suitably represent preferences that cannot be defined precisely. Fuzzy control depends on a logical system which is similar in spirit to human thinking than conventional logical systems. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Medical images are used by the doctors which helps in diagnosis of diseases. The common format of medical image is DICOM. DICOM stands for Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine. They are required for the diagnosis of diseases but often these images are corrupted by noises and the images are of low quality. The diagnose of disease will become more difficultfor the low quality DICOM images which is corrupted by noise sources. So the medical image quality has to be increased and the noises are to be removed without increasing its cost of construction. The medical image quality can be improved by enhancement techniques. Histogram equalization and contrast enhancement are the most common and low cost method of enhancement of these medical images. Filters are used to decorrelate the effects of noise which affects those images by inverse model of the noise function. There are various types of filters available to reduce the noise of the image. When the image is subjected to enhancement technique, the noises present in the image are also enhanced and so it is vital to reduce those noises before enhancement process. The medical image’s quality can be improved by the concept of super resolution. It involves using multiple low resolution images to form a single super resolution image. The cost for constructing the super resolution image is lower than that of constructing a high resolution image © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Security of the power system is determined by its ability to withstand contingencies (disturbances) without interruption of power supply. Security assessment is done off-line in which steady state and dynamic performance of the system, for the given operating conditions are analyzed using simulation. Contingency analysis is one of the security assessments, which involves an extensive search for contingencies that create operating limit violation and is also performed to determine the impact of the potential contingency on the remaining power system. For analysis, each possible contingency that might occur in the power system is considered. Contingency ranking is the process of ranking the contingencies depending on the impact (severity) it creates on the power system. Performance Index (PI) is one of the severity index used for contingency ranking. For performance index calculated using low order exponent terms, misclassification of contingencies occurs. Using higher order terms, misclassification can be eliminated but it requires a lot of computational space, time and efficiency for large power system. The proposed method uses a term in the performance index formula called compensation factor to eliminate misclassification. Appreciable results are obtained using the above method in IEEE 5 bus and IEEE 14 bus system. © Research India Publications.},

It also reduces the use of bituminous materials and disposal problems of such waste material. Developing countries are moving towards construction concrete pavement or converting bituminous pavements into concrete pavements. Hence in this paper an attempt has been made to study the feasibility of using LDPE raw material itself as a modifier in cement concrete with a characteristic compressive strength of 20 MPa. Present study focuses on effect of addition of LDPE raw material (3, 4 and 5%) under different temperatures (70°C, 80°C and 90°C) and duration of thermal curing (4, 8 and 16 hours) on compressive strength, corrosion resistance and sorptivity. It was inferred from the results that, addition of LDPE raw material considerably increases the compressive strength, resistance against corrosion and permeability. Results also revealed that concrete with 3% LDPE modifier for 80°C with 4 hours of thermal curing was found to be optimum. © School of Engineering, Taylor’s University.},

abstract={The precise prediction of splice junctions as exon-intron or intron-exon boundaries in a given DNA sequence is an important task in Bioinformatics. The main challenge is to determine the splice sites in the coding region. Due to the intrinsic complexity and the uncertainty in gene sequence, the adoption of data mining methods is increasingly becoming popular. There are various methods developed on different strategies in this direction. This article focuses on the construction of new hybrid machine learning ensembles that solve the splice junction task more effectively. A novel supervised feature reduction technique is developed using entropy-based fuzzy rough set theory optimized by greedy hill-climbing algorithm. The average prediction accuracy achieved is above 98% with 95% confidence interval. The performance of the proposed methods is evaluated using various metrics to establish the statistical significance of the results. The experiments are conducted using various schemes with human DNA sequence data. The obtained results are highly promising as compared with the state-of-the-art approaches in literature. © 2014 Taylor and Francis.},

abstract={Since the technologies of Internet and wireless communication have grown tremendously in the past, people have always occupied of some security sensitive wireless devices for the Internet services, such as voice call, instant messaging, online game, electronic banking, electronics trading and so on. Over a few decades, session key sharing has been used as a promising strategy for two/three parties authentication. In addition, several authentication and key agreement (AKA) protocols have been developed, but then very few protocols have been dedicated for the IP multimedia domain. In the literature, the 3-PAKE schemes, such as Xie et al., Xiong et al., Tallapally, Hsieh et al. and Tseng et al. have thoroughly been studied for the identification of its security weaknesses. Following are the security weaknesses of 3-PAKE schemes, namely user anonymity, known-key security, mutual authentication, (perfect) forward secrecy and so on. In addition, the existing schemes can not withstand for the attacks, like modification, key-impersonation, parallel-session, privileged-insider and so on. Thus, this paper presents a novel three party authentication and key agreement protocol based on computational Diffie–Hellman which not only fulfills all the security properties of AKA, but also provides the resiliency to the most of the potential attacks. Since the proposed 3-PAKE scheme has less computational overhead, it is able to curtail all the hop-by-hop security association defined by the standard of third generation partnership project. Above all, a real time multimedia server and client systems have been designed and developed for the purpose of average end-to-end delay analysis. The examination result is shown that the proposed 3-PAKE scheme can offer better service extensibility than the other 3-PAKE schemes, since it has the minimum message rounds to be executed for the establishment of service connection. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Highly ordered mesoporous material Santa Barbara acid-15 (SBA-15) was obtained from sugarcane leaf ash, a low cost silica source. It is highly critical today to use an inexpensive and non-toxic silica source for SBA-15 production. The objectives of the this study were to (1) investigate the relationship between the time of sonication (t), amount of sodium hydroxide used (WR) and temperature (T) maintained using response surface methodology and obtain maximum percentage recovery of silica, (2) to synthesis SBA-15 from recovered silica (water glass), (3) to produce biodiesel from Calophyllum inophyllum oil using methanol as alcohol under heterogeneous catalysis. The catalyst medium was a calcium acetate impregnated silicate mesoporous material called SBA-15. The optimum conditions for maximum recovery of SiO2 (57.99 %) were found to be: reaction temperature—110 °C, NaOH to ash weight ratio—1:3 and sonication reaction time—5 h. The transesterification reaction was conducted with different methanol to oil ratios (3:1, 8:1, 12:1, 16:1, 18:1) at different temperatures such as 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90 °C in the presence of heterogeneous catalyst. The maximum yield of 88.77 % at 16:1 alcohol to oil ratio (molar) and 96.82 % at the temperature of 80 °C was obtained. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Abstract: Nano-composite of Ag/ZnO was prepared in the presence of Escherichia coli nitrate reductase enzyme with silver from AgNO3 over ZnO. Ag/ZnO produced was characterized using field emission scanning electron microscope, energy-dispersive spectroscopy, transmission electron microscope, X-ray diffraction, porosimetry system and UV–Vis–NIR spectrophotometer. Prepared catalyst was used to oxidize Reactive Black B in aqueous solution under visible light. Effects of silver concentration, initial dye concentration, pH, catalyst dosage and reusability of the composites were studied. The photo degradation followed pseudo-first order kinetics. Further, the potential of catalyst for decolourisation of textile industry effluent were also examined and it was observed that 40 % COD reduction and 100 % colour removal was achieved within 120 min of reaction.

abstract={Cholera, a known diarrheal disease is associated with various risk factors like hypovolemic shock, rice watery stools, and death in developing countries. The overuse of antibiotics to treat cholera imposed a selective pressure for the emergence and spread of multi-drug resistant Vibrio cholerae strains. The failure of conventional antimicrobial therapy urged the researchers to find an alternative therapy that could meddle the cholera murmurs (Quorum Sensing). It seems to effectively overcome the conventional cholera therapies in parallel to decrease the morbidity and mortality rate in the developing countries. The paramount objective of this review essentially focuses on the different Quorum Sensing (QS) regulatory switches governing virulence and pathogenicity of Vibrio cholerae. This review also provides an insight into the plausible QS targets that could be exploited to bring about a breakthrough to the prevailing cholera therapy. © 2015, Association of Microbiologists of India.},

abstract={Vegetable oils contain natural antioxidants like sterols, phosphatides, tocopherols, tocotrienols etc. In the present study, the efficiency and stability of natural antioxidant in unrefined mustard oil, groundnut oil and sesame oil on heating is studied. The oils undergo five cycles of heating to a frying temperature (210°C) and their antioxidant activity is premeditated using radical scavenging assay. The inhibition concentration of unheated and heated mustard oil, groundnut oil and sesame oil (with solvent benzene) and the stability of natural antioxidant at different concentrations are evaluated using 2, 2'-azino-bis 3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical method. The result showed that the antioxidant activity in unheated oils are more compared to heated oils using ABTS radical scavenging activity (IC50 24.31, 25.26 and 24.42 for unheated and IC50 49.7, 54.55 and 46.39 for heated). The scavenging activity is also studied using DPPH analysis (IC50 26.22, 27.37 and 28.25 for unheated and IC50 53.3, 59.49 and 49.18 for heated). The ABTS method is highly correlated with DPPH and the correlation coefficient is computed (Pearson's correlation r &lt;0.04; p&lt;0.01).},

abstract={Until now, various chemometric tools have been used to approximate solutions to address the nonlinear amperometric biosensor modeling challenge. Hence, an analytical method capable of predicting the non-constant slope (dynamic sensitivity) of a non-linear amperometric biosensor model has been developed. The dynamic sensitivity, and any given point in a given amperometric biosensor's operation, is predicted by solving a series of mathematical constants corresponding to the physical entities of the amperometric biosensor itself. In order to validate the proposed models, data of butyrin biosensor were considered. The effectiveness of these models was statistically analyzed and found that the first-order dynamic sensitivity model was better than that of the second order. This dynamic sensitivity slope prediction, in turn, can be used to predict the concentration of an analyte when a non-constant amperometric sensor response is known.

abstract={Zea mays (maize) and Vig na radiata (green gram) are found to be the chromium (Cr) tolerant and sensitive plants, respectively. In the present paper, we investigate the reduction of the toxicity of Cr in the sensitive plants by the mixed crop cultivation in the field using various amendments. Further, the potassium dichromate was used as the source of hexavalent Cr. The results indicated that Cr adversely affects both the growth and yield of plants. The soil properties vary with Cr and different fertilizer amendments and the yield of both plants were affected by Cr. We conclude that metal accumulation of seeds of green gram was higher than corn and the application of single fertilizer either farm yard manure (FYM) or nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium (NPK) enhances the growth and yield of both the tolerant and sensitive plants in the mixed crop cultivations.

abstract={Estimating lactate concentration in the meat food products has been a serious concern since it induces hepatic immaturity in children below the age of 3. This article is aimed to illustrate the statistical modeling for the estimation of lactate in meat food products and to identify the interrelation between the amount of lactate added to the phosphate buffered saline (0.1 M, 7.4 pH) and other electrochemical parameters such as amount of charge consumed, surface coverage, cathodic peak current, cathodic peak potential, full width at half maximum of cathodic peak height and electron transfer rate constant. The gold working electrode was modified by immobilizing lactate dehydrogenase on ZnO nanorods. The modified gold working electrode was used for the determination of lactate by linear sweep voltammetry. Multivariate data analysis was performed with the values of electrochemical parameters. This analysis showed the significant relation between the amount of charge consumed and full width at half maximum of cathodic peak height with the added lactate concentrations. Based on these relationships, a multiple linear regression model was framed for the estimation of lactate in meat food products. Copyright © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.},

abstract={Context: Withania somnifera (L) Dunal (Solanaceae) is an important traditional herbal medicine used for thousands of years and is considered as the Indian ginseng. Reports on the effect of Withania somnifera root (WSR) extract on the developing foetus of pregnant rats including mortality, structural abnormalities, changes in growth and effects on dams are not available. Objective: The present study was performed to evaluate the prenatal developmental toxicity potential of WSR extract in rats. Materials and methods: WSR extract was given orally to pregnant rats during the period of major organogenesis and histogenesis (days 5 to 19 of gestation) at the dose levels of 500, 1000 and 2000 mg/kg/day. Clinical observations including mortality, moribundity, behavioural changes, signs of overt toxicity, body weight, gross pathological changes of dams and foetal analyses including external malformations, skeletal and soft tissue malformations were evaluated. Results: No evidence of maternal or foetal toxicity was observed. WSR extract caused no changes (p <0.05) in body weight of parental females, number of corpora lutea, implantations, viable foetuses, external, skeletal and visceral malformations. Discussion and conclusion: Under the conditions of the study, the no-observed-effect level (NOEL) of WSR extract for maternal and developmental toxicity was concluded to be at least 2000 mg/kg/day. © 2015 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

abstract={Agriculture is the backbone of our economic system which had been associated with the production of basic food crops. Tremendous benefits have been derived from the use of pesticides in agriculture, forestry and other sectors. They are used to control pests, diseases and weeds, but conventional pesticides can contaminate surface water through runoff from treated plants and soil which results in incomplete release of the molecules and short residence time at the required sites. To overcome this drawback and to maximize the utilization of these pesticides, in-situ gel formulation would be an effective alternative. In-situ gelling polymeric delivery system is a novel technique in which the active ingredient present in the form of solution gets converted into a gel upon application to the site of action. The formation of gel depends on factors like temperature modulation, pH change, presence of ions and ultra violet irradiation; the in-situ gel formulation can sustain the release and also reduce the frequency of administration. So it is widely applied in drug delivery for ophthalmic, nasal, rectal and vaginal route of administration for improving both local and systemic effects of drug, and thereby its bioavailability. The objective of this review is to explore such new trends adapted for pesticide delivery systems to enhance the food production. Recently, these types of approaches are being explored in pesticide delivery systems to control various infections. © 2015, International Journal of Pharmaceutical and Clinical Research.

The electron density is found to be more on the arsenic sites than in gallium sites across GaAs nanoribbon. The transmission spectrum provides the insight to the transmission of electrons at different energy intervals across GaAs nanoribbon. The transmission pathways give the visualization of possible path for the electrons, when the bias voltage is varied between the electrodes.

abstract={The advances in nanomedicine demonstrate the anticancer properties of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and considered as an alternative to the available chemotherapeutic agents. Owing to the preferential interaction of Artocarpus integrifolia lectin (jacalin) with Galβ1-3GalNAcα (a chemically well-defined tumor associated antigen), a study was undertaken to understand the interaction mechanism of AgNPs with jacalin in presence of specific sugar, galactose. Fluorescence spectroscopic analysis revealed that the AgNPs binding significantly quenched the intrinsic fluorescence of jacalin through a static quenching mechanism, and a non-radiative energy transfer occurred within the molecules. Association constants obtained from the interaction of different sugar-stabilized AgNPs with jacalin are in the order of 104 M-1, this is in the same range as those obtained for the interaction of lectin with carbohydrate and hydrophobic ligand. Each subunit of the tetrameric jacalin binds one AgNPs, and the stoichiometry was unaffected by the presence of the specific sugar, galactose. Hemagglutination assay shows that sugar stabilized AgNPs interacts to jacalin at a site that is different from the saccharide-binding site. Analysis of the FTIR spectra of jacalin indicates that the binding of AgNPs does not alter the secondary structure of jacalin. More importantly, AgNPs exists in nano form even after interacting with the lectin. These results suggest that the development of lectin-AgNPs conjugate would be possible for diagnosis and treatment of cancer. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Objectives: Hydrogen sulphide (H2S) has a protective effect against renal ischemia reperfusion injury (I/R), but it is toxic and have the limitation for its controlled in-vivo release to the system. However, its metabolite thiosulfate can release low amounts of H2S, is non toxic and clinically approved drug for end renal failure, cyanide toxicity and calcific nephrolithiasis, and may possess anti-ischemic reperfusion effect. The objective of this study was to determine the anti ischemia reperfusion (I/R) effect of sodium thiosulfate (STS). Methods: I/R was induced in LLC PK1 renal tubular epithelial cells by reversibly treatment of cells with glucose oxidase (3 mM/s) and catalase (998/s) in a glucose deprived media. STS was administered to the cells as pre-treated, preconditioned or post conditioned drug. Results: Pre-treatment of LLC PK1 cells with STS protects the cells from I/R injury but not, when the cells were preconditioned or post conditioned with STS, examined through cell viability tests like sulforhodamine B, crystal violet and LDH activity. Propargylglycine the endogenous H2S biosynthetic inhibitor treatment to the cells did not negate the renal protection mediated by STS pre-treatment indicate the possible release of H2S. Conclusion: This study indicates that STS plays a protective role in I/R induced renal injury when they were administered as pre-treated drug by modulating H2S metabolism. © 2015, International Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Science.

abstract={Linear sweep voltammetry was used as an analytical technique to measure methylglyoxal in blood samples by employing Pt/ZnO sepals/GLO 1 bio-electrode. In order to increase the specificity of glyoxalase towards methylglyoxal and to predict the non-linear relationship between added methylglyoxal concentrations and pairs of electrochemical parameters, non-linear logistic and Gaussian cumulative response surface models were fitted to the experimental results using Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. An excellent correlation (r = 0.99) was observed between the predicted and added methylglyoxal col n ivcentra tions. The accuracy of the proposed models was validated by calculating relative prediction error (RPE), percentage recovery and root mean square error for cross validation (RMSECV). Only the MG = f(FWHM, J pc ) logistic cumulative response model showed best results in validation (RPE = 2.07 × 10- 5 , Recovery = 98.726% and RMSECV = -0.004). The calibrated non-linear model was further validated on human blood samples. The attained relative standard deviation and percentage recovery values calculated for spiked methylglyoxal concentrations (3 measurements) were typically below 6.54% and 116.48% respectively.

abstract={The tunable textural properties of self-oriented mesoporous silica were investigated for their suitability as enzyme immobilization matrices to support transesterification of rice bran oil. Different morphologies of mesoporous silica (rod-like, rice-like, and spherical) were synthesized and characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms. The surface area, pore size, and ordered arrangement of the pores were found to influence the immobilization and activity of the enzyme in the mesopores. The immobilization in rod-like silica was highest with an immobilization efficiency of 63 % and exhibited minimal activity loss after immobilization. Functionalization of the mesoporous surface with ethyl groups further enhanced the enzyme immobilization. The free enzyme lost most of its activity at 50 °C while the immobilized enzyme showed activity even up to 60 °C. Transesterified product yield of nearly 82 % was obtained for 24 h of reaction with enzyme immobilized on ethyl-functionalized SBA-15 at an oil:methanol ratio of 1:3. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT–IR) and Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) were used to characterize the transesterified product obtained. The reusability of the immobilized enzyme was studied for 3 cycles. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Scaffolds for orthopedic reconstruction should best mimic the microenvironment of the bone to instil regenerative potential. In this study, a three-dimensional porous microsphere sintered scaffold that closely resembles bone micro-architecture has been fabricated. Synthesized nanohydroxyapatite (∼30-90 nm) using wet chemical precipitation and poly(hydroxybutyrate)/poly(ε-caprolactone) were blended to develop composite porous microspheres via emulsion induced phase separation. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller analysis reveals presence of cylindrical mesopores in microspheres with surface area 10.64 m2 g-1, which on solvent/non-solvent sintering to scaffold, resembles trabecular section of rat sternum. The scaffold demonstrates desirable compressive strength (1.16 ± 0.17 MPa) and compressive modulus (6.8 ± 1.3 MPa) with slow degradation and microstructural stability for four weeks. Further, incorporation of bovine serum albumin (BSA) in the scaffold establishes protein-mineral interface and exhibits two-phase protein release mechanism (diffusion and polymer degradation). Pore interconnectivity and functional protein loading of scaffold have been evidenced by protein distribution analysis and secondary structural stability. The transverse section of MG63 cells cultured scaffolds with and without protein demonstrates cell infiltration and extension across the pores, while significantly higher proliferation is observed in protein scaffolds at day 7 (p &lt; 0.05). Hence, the biomimetic scaffold with protein-mineral interface could be an ideal substitute for bone regeneration as it establish cell-matrix interaction. © 2015 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

The electronic transport properties are discussed in terms of device density of states and transmission spectrum of MgS nanotubes. The effects of Mn substitution and Se substitution in nanotubes are studied. The major contribution to density of states arises only from p orbitals in MgS nanotubes. The substitution effect and bias voltages also have influence in the density of states. The transmission spectrum provides information about the transmission of electrons along the nanotube.

abstract={Gesture recognition is the fast growing field in image processing and artificial technology. The gesture recognition is a process in which the gestures or postures of human body parts are identified and are used to control computers and other electronic appliances. The most contributing reason for the emerging gesture recognition is that they can create a simple communication path between human and computer called HCI (Human Computer Interaction). This paper is confined to identification of hand postures and to establish a man-machine interaction. The hand region in the image is detected and the number of active fingers is determined. In this approach, the input which is an image or a frame from a video can be obtained from web camera or any other camera. This color image is converted into binary image and preprocessed and the number of fingers is counted using scanning method in MATLAB. This is a simple yet efficient approach. The main reason to employ scanning method is to make the code to recognize the finger count independent of size and rotation of the hand © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={The guanine derivative antiviral drug acyclovir (ACV) is one of the oldest molecules laying successful market until date, being commercially available in various dosage forms for oral, topical and parenteral administrations. Clinical application of this drug is superior to new antiviral agents due to its potential values such as suppression of recurrence, safety profile, minimal drug interactions, and being inexpensive. ACV is slightly water-soluble, less permeable and poorly bioavailable, yet more potential antiviral molecule, the physicochemical modifications and novel dosage form approaches resulted with more than 100 research works within a decade. The survey of literature showed enormous reports on ACV formulation development, which includes modified tablets, particulate drug delivery, vesicular drug delivery, polymeric nanoparticles, bioadhesive systems, floating dosage forms, in situ gelling systems, transdermal delivery, implantable systems, emulsified dosage forms, polymeric films/patches, etc. As the drug could be administered via multiple routes for effective site targeted action at various doses, and attracted the attention of many researches, the review of the current approaches for the delivery of ACV could be more beneficial for the new scientists. This paper is a review of recent researches highlighting the development of newer techniques and novel dosage forms of ACV for better therapeutic efficacy, which were aimed at enhancing its solubility, permeability and bioavailability. © 2015, Medknow Publications.

It is observed that strength properties of HS-SFRC 1.0% are high compared to 0.5% & 0.75% of fibre content. It is clearly shown that the increase in strength is due to the increase in fibre content.

abstract={The membrane interactions and localization of flavonoids play a vital role in altering membrane-mediated cell signaling cascades as well as influence the pharmacological activities such as anti-tumour, anti-microbial and anti-oxidant properties of flavonoids. Various techniques have been used to investigate the membrane interaction of flavonoids. These include partition coefficient, fluorescence anisotropy, differential scanning calorimetry, NMR spectroscopy, electrophysiological methods and molecular dynamics simulations. Each technique will provide specific information about either alteration of membrane fluidity or localization of flavonoids within the lipid bilayer. Apart from the diverse techniques employed, the concentrations of flavonoids and lipid membrane composition employed in various studies reported in literature also are different and together these variables contribute to diverse findings that sometimes contradict each other. This review highlights different techniques employed to investigate the membrane interaction of flavonoids with special emphasis on erythrocyte model membrane systems and their significance in understanding the nature and extent of flavonoid-membrane interactions. We also attempt to correlate the membrane localization and alteration in membrane fluidity with the biological activities of flavonoids such as anti-oxidant, anti-cancer and anti-microbial properties. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Objective: To detect the variability in the expression of cell cycle genes such as Cyclin D1,CDK4 p21,p27 and p57 associated with cytotoxicity of Human epidermoid carcinoma cells using qPCR. Methods: The synthesis silver nanoparticles and chitosan coated silver nanoparticles was done by chemical reduction method using polyvinyalpyrolidone (PVP) as surfactant and glucose as reducing agent. The cell proliferation assay was performed using MTS assay. Gene expression analysis was performed using Eppendorf Realplex 2 PCR systems. Results: The lowest concentration of 1mg of Chitosan-AgNPs with 25μg/ml concentration showed 35% reduction in the A431 cell line growth. Significantly increased expression of p21, p27, p57, CCND1 and CD4 gene was observed among 1mg of Chitosan-AgNPs with 25μg/ml concentrations indicating potential apoptotic activity at the lowest concentration of Chitosan-AgNPs on A431 cells. Conclusions: The effect of AgNPs inducing apoptosis/growth arrest at low concentrations (1mg-25μg/ml) has been more effective while coating the nanoparticle with chitosan. The potential apoptotic properties of Chitosan-AgNPs are evident by the significant up regulation of the cell cycle genes when treated with low concentration of Chitosan-AgNPs. © 2015, International Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences.

abstract={Objective: To investigate chemical compositions, α-amylase inhibitory and antioxidant capacity of the essential oils from the unripe fruit pulp and leaves of a traditional medicinal plant Syzygium cumini. Methods: The essential oils of unripe fruit pulp and leaves of S. cumini were obtained by hydro-distillation and analyzed by GC-FID and GC-MS. In vitro α-amylase inhibitory and DPPH radical scavenging assay were carried out to study the antidiabetic and antioxidant activities of the essential oils. Results: Thirty four components representing 99.3% of the unripe fruit pulp oil and 66 components representing 95.3% of the leaf essential oil were identified. α-cadinol (25.8%) and α-pinene (21.5%) were the major component of unripe fruit pulp and leaf oil respectively. The leaf oil showed better α-amylase inhibitory activity than unripe fruit pulp oil, while unripe fruit pulp oil exhibited higher antioxidant activity. Conclusions: The mild α-amylase inhibitory and antioxidant activities of both oils are ideal for designing functional foods and can be used in food applications which aim to control diabetes. © 2015, International Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences.

The Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a diagnostic imaging method, which measures the electrical activity in the brain. The main principle of this study is to observe the performance of classifiers regarding Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using wavelet coefficients for seizure detection. This paper uses discrete wavelet transform to analyse EEG signals, which are non-stationary. The EEG signals were decomposed by db1, db2 (daubechies wavelet) and haar wavelet. Grey Level Cooccurrence Matrix (GLCM) and statistical features are extracted from the decomposed EEG signal. This work concludes that SVM classifiers using db2 with hybrid features are the best outcomes for EEG signal classification. Copyright © 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

In comparison, four performance metrics were used. The aim of the study is to determine the best decision tree classifier for mass classification from BI-RADS features (mass shape, mass margin, assessment and subtlety). In the experimental studies, all these decision tree algorithms are applied on the UCI data set.

abstract={Regeneration of functional small diameter blood vessels still remains a challenge, as the synthetic vascular grafts fail to mimic the complex structural architecture and dynamic functions of blood vessels and also lack with the lack of non-thrombogenicity. Although, the existence of nanofibrous extracellular matrix components in the native tissue promotes many physical and molecular signals to the endothelial cells for the regulation of morphogenesis, homeostasis, and cellular functions in vascular tissue, poor understanding of the structural architecture on the functional activation of appropriate genes limits the development of successful vascular graft design. Hence, the present review outlines the functional contributions of various nanofibrous extracellular matrix components in native blood vessels. Further, the review focuses on the role of nanofiber topography of biomaterial scaffolds in endothelial cell fate processes such as adhesion, proliferation, migration, and infiltration with the expression of vasculature specific genes; thereby allowing the reader to envisage the communication between the nano-architecture of scaffolds and endothelial cells in engineering small diameter vascular grafts. © 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

abstract={Using fly ash as a partial substitute for cement in concrete construction has become popular, mainly because of its availability and economicality in large volume construction. But, the resulting deficiency in performance of the concrete has been a cause of concern, and in this study, it is proposed to introduce polypropylene fibers adaptively to compensate for strength. An experimental program was carried out with fly ash, fiber content and layers as parameters. The fly ash content is varied from 0% to 30% and the fiber content from 0 to 0.60%. It was found that the loss due to introduction of fly ash could be easily compensated through fibers. This study has been carried out to investigate the feasibility of use of polypropylene fibers and evaluate the effect of fiber length and fiber content in concrete to perform better structural properties. ANOVA statistical method was used to evaluate the effect of fiber and fly ash content in concrete to study the strength characteristics and modulus of elasticity. © 2015 JUST. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={The restoration of strength and stiffness of damaged reinforced concrete beams with deficient reinforcements, through retrofitting, was experimentally and numerically studied. Retrofitting is carried out by wrapping glass fiber strips using cement-based composite binders. Six beams of size 1500mm (length) ×100mm (width) × 150mm (depth) have been tested in four-point bending. Three beams are used as reference beams, whereas the other three are cast as shear deficient beams and loaded up to first few cracks.The damaged beams were repaired, cured and retrofitted. Flexure test is carried out to find the average ultimate load, maximum deflection, maximum moment, stiffness, energy absorption and crack pattern of reference and preloaded retrofitted beams. Numerical analysis is carried out for the similar shear deficient beams. It is concluded that the ultimate load and moment carrying capacity were restored in preloaded retrofitted beams. The stiffness and energy absorption are improved in preloaded wrapped beams with deflection at ultimate load being reduced. © 2015 JUST. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={Two-phase heat transfer involving two immiscible systems is gaining importance in petrochemical and allied industries. Varying compositions of second component (liquid) and water were experimentally studied in the shell side of a 1:2 shell-and-tube heat exchanger. The single-phase heat transfer coefficient on pure water and pure liquid were fitted to the Reynolds number range studied for generating the two-phase parameter correlation. The two-phase multiplier was related to the Lockhart-Martinelli (L-M) parameter using the two-phase experimental data and a correlation was established. The two-phase heat transfer coefficient was calculated based on the coefficients a and m for single-phase data along with two-phase multiplier and L-M parameter. The calculated values of the two-phase heat transfer coefficient based on pure component and pure water suggest that water is a better reference fluid for the two-phase liquid-water systems studied and obtained with an average error ranging between 0.74 and 1.89%. In this experimental work, a general correlation was also developed with respect to dimensionless groups by fitting the two-phase experimental data of seven two-phase systems studied and proved with minimum average absolute deviation between experimental and theoretical values. © 2015 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={The novel AlN nanoribbon molecular device is investigated using density functional theory for different voltage bias. The electronic transport properties of AlN nanoribbon are discussed in terms of device density of states, electron density, transmission spectrum and transmission pathways. It is evident that increasing the bias voltage leads to transition of electrons from the valence band to the conduction band across AlN nanoribbon. The electron density is found to be more along nitrogen sites. The transmission increases with the increase in bias voltage. The transmission can be fine-tuned at different energy intervals by varying the bias potential. The transmission pathways provide the insight for transmission of electrons along AlN nanoribbon. Mostly, the transmission is observed along the top and bottom regions of AlN nanoribbon. The results of the present work will give a clear picture to improve the electronic transport property along AlN nanoribbon. © 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Aminoacyl tRNA synthetases are novel antibacterial drug target because of their important role in protein synthesis. In this study, we performed high throughput virtual screening of 205883 compounds from Asinex ligand database to identify potential specific inhibitors for Tyrosyl tRNA synthetase of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MtbTyrRS). Compounds are ranked based on the glide extra precision docking score. It is noted that the top ranked compounds have caffeine scaffold. The top five caffeine analogs are further evaluated for other druglike properties. The binding energies of caffeine analogs are estimated using mixed mode quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculation. The results show that these caffeine analogs have good absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion properties and high binding affinity to the MtbTyrRS. This suggests that caffeine could be a new scaffold for designing inhibitors against Tyrosyl tRNA synthetase of M. tuberculosis. The top five caffeine analogs are also subjected to docking calculations with human cytosolic and mitochondrial Tyrosyl tRNA synthetases to ascertain their specificities toward MtbTyrRS. The comparative docking studies indicate that the top five caffeine analogs are specific for MtbTyrRS. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Matured Schwann cells play a vital role in promoting regeneration and restoration of functional peripheral nervous tissue. In the present study, two dimensional film, three dimensional random and longitudinally aligned electrospun fibers of poly(lactide-co-glycolide) were used to evaluate the effect of topography on expressions of myelin related genes. The aligned nanofibrous scaffold demonstrated significant increase in Schwann cell adhesion using after 3, 6 and 12 hours of culture compared to the film and random fibers. Cell morphology, degree of orientation and elongation factor evaluated using a scanning electron microscope revealed that cells on aligned scaffold have spindle morphology, whereas cells on random and two dimensional films favor spherical morphology confirming the effect of topography. Significant increase in elongation factor was observed in aligned scaffold as compared to film and random fibers (p <0.05). The gene expression analysis revealed that aligned scaffold significantly up-regulated the expression of early myelination markers: myelinassociated glycoprotein and myelin protein zero, cell adhesion molecule: neural cadherin, extracellular matrix molecule: neurocan, as well the down-regulation of non-myelinating Schwann cell marker: neural cell adhesion molecule when compared to random and film (p < 0.05). The gene expression patterns of aligned fibers favor myelination of Schwann cells when compared to film and random fibers. Thus, our results demonstrate that the aligned topography of the scaffold promotes maturation of Schwann cells and thereby its myelination to maintain its functionality.},

First method deals with gray image, and the subsequent methods encounter color image. Pixel indicator technique is used for selecting the plane of embedding for color images. Embedding is done in block segmentation fashion. We have devised a novel mod4 methodology which tells us about the order of embedding, number of bits to be embedded in each pixel as well as about indicator channel in PIT and also tremendously escalates the randomization.

abstract={Abnormal growth of tissues inside the brain leads to the formation of brain tumor. In order to decrease the mortality rate due to brain tumor, efficient techniques for the earlier detection of the tumors are required. The present-day technological advancements include the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, computed tomography (CT) scans, and advanced X-rays which help us in tumor detection. The MRI scans are widely used nowadays because of its noninvasive radiation and the accuracy of the images. This paper proposes a strategy for efficient detection of a brain tumor in MRI brain images. The system proposed in this paper is a handy tool for accurate prediction and segmentation of brain tumor. The general properties of the images called the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) features and the spatial feature (mean) are combined with the transform domain-based discrete cosine transform (DCT) features that are extracted from the MR images are used as feature sets. Support vector machine (SVM) is used as the classifier which classifies the images as tumorous or non-tumorous. Once the classification is done using SVM classifier, the tumorous images are alone subjected to watershed transform-based segmentation to exactly extract the tumor region alone. The entire experiment is conducted on the images of various patients acquired from MEDALL DIAGNOSTICS, Tiruchirappalli, India. The method gives accuracy of over 99%, hence improving the chances for the patients’ survival by proper detection of tumors at an early stage. © Springer India 2015.},

The electronic transport properties of AlN nanoribbon are discussed in terms of device density of states, electron density, transmission spectrum and transmission pathways. It is evident that increasing the bias voltage leads to transition of electrons from the valence band to the conduction band across AlN nanoribbon. The electron density is found to be more along nitrogen sites. The transmission increases with the increase in bias voltage. The transmission can be fine-tuned at different energy intervals by varying the bias potential. The transmission pathways provide the insight for transmission of electrons along AlN nanoribbon. Mostly, the transmission is observed along the top and bottom regions of AlN nanoribbon. The results of the present work will give a clear picture to improve the electronic transport property along AlN nanoribbon. © 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Chemical transformations of metal nanoparticles can be an important way to mitigate nanoparticle toxicity. Sulfidation of silver nanoparticle (AgNPs) is a natural process shown to occur in environment. Very few studies, employing microbes and embryonic stages of zebrafish, have shown reduction in AgNPs toxicity as a direct result of sulfidation. However the feasibility of reducing nanoparticle toxicity by sulfidation of AgNPs has never been studied in adult vertebrates. In this study, we have used adult zebrafish as a model to study the efficacy of sulfidation of AgNPs in reducing nanoparticle toxicity by employing a battery of biomarkers in liver and brain. While AgNPs enhanced liver oxidative stress, altered detoxification enzymes and affected brain acetylcholinesterase activity, sulfidation of AgNPs resulted in significant alleviation of changes in these parameters. Histopathological analyses of liver and sulphydryl levels also support the significance of sulfidated AgNPs in controlling the toxicity of AgNPs. Our study provides the first biochemical data on the importance of sulfidation of AgNPs in reducing biological toxicity in adult vertebrates. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Electrical energy is the prime need for running out industrial process, commercial applications and mainly it is the criteria that decide the economic wealth of any nation in today world. Solar energy is an important resource which finds an increasing use in real world because of its convincing advantages over other sources. The proposed system prototype takes the solar energy as the key aspect and efficiently harvesting the power to be used as a remote backup device in the real time applications. The major factors that makes the prospective model over the existing system is the portability and considerably smaller in size. The system can function with high degree of performance as an external power supply device for industrial utilization and in remote and harsh environments such as surveillance applications. To obtain the energy in accessible form as needed by the load or grid where problems such as voltage fluctuations and ripples may be the disturbances. To overcome this, in the proposed work the processors LPC 2148 and ATMega-8L are used. The processor typically achieves by the usage of inherent PWM channels as modified for the above mentioned by means of algorithms.

A highly selective colorimetric sensing of Fe3+ ions was observed with 1 and 2. Addition of Fe3+ leads to selective decolourisation of yellow colour. But naphthaldehyde based chemosensor, 3, exhibited selective disappearance of yellow colour for Cu2+ ions. On the other hand, diethylamine substituted chemosensor, 4, showed generation of clear strong yellow colour selectively for Fe3+ and Hg2+ ions. Similarly, 5 also showed generation of yellow colour from colourless solution upon addition of Fe3+ selectively. The concentration dependent studies of 1-5 revealed the ppm level detection of metal ions.

Myosins are group of proteins driven by ATP hydrolysis and are very essential in cellular activities. The conservation in the ATP binding residues in myosins can lead to better understanding of mutant states during diseases. In this study we have studied ATP conserved sequences in several isoforms of myosins. This study will thus pave way for targeting ATP sequences during drug delivery mechanisms.},

abstract={Thermal comfort is an imperative factor that determines the health and productivity of the occupants living in residential buildings. The growing health related symptoms and demand for the electrical energy encourage the occupants to switch over to natural ventilation. Thermal comfort for naturally ventilated buildings mainly depends on the size and orientation of window openings. Even though most research works include the study on indoor thermal comfort for various positions of window opening it was limited to single sided and cross ventilated buildings. In real situation most of the rooms attached to the residential buildings are having window openings at their adjacent wall and hence this paper was focused to study the occupants’ thermal comfort and indoor air flow characteristics for a room with adjacent window openings under generalized approach. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique is employed to study the indoor air flow for a three-dimensional room model. The CFD simulation is checked for grid independence and having good validation with experimental measurements on the reduced scale model at wind tunnel and with the network model with the k–ε turbulence model. Air temperatures along various midlines, planes, areas occupied by low temperature zone and predicted mean vote (PMV) contours are presented in this paper. From this study a new set of strategies are identified to locate the window openings and the best location improves percentage of low temperature by 50%, reduces the PMV and PPD by 0.12% and 3.51%, respectively with reference to the worst window opening position. © 2015},

The Composite scaffolds made from biodegradable polymers and bone mineral-like inorganic compounds by electrospinning have been reported to be advantageous over the Traditional Metallic bone Implants and Bone scaffolds fabricated from polymers. In this work the crystalline natured bone mineral Nanocrystalline hydroxyapatitite artificially synthesized by solution precipitation method. And the Novel nanofibrous Biocomposites Scaffold were fabricated by electrospinning method from polycaprolactone (PCL) solutions containing Nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite (NHAp) with a dry weight ratio of (80:20, 75; 25, 50; 50). The morphology of the synthesized materials was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The effect of the solution concentration, the applied voltage, and Tip-Collector distance on the pure PCL and NHAp incorporated PCL fibrous structure was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The formed nanocomposite has increased surface roughness. So, the surface to volume ratio was enhanced. Henceforth better cell adhesion would be there over the scaffold. Electrospun PCL Scaffold is hydrophobic in nature, but incorporation of NHAp enhances the invasion of metabolic ions in to the Scaffold by increasing the hydrophilicity. Hence, the Nano-fibrous and Biomimetic Scaffold may serve as a superior for promoting osteoblast differentiation and biomineralization. © 2015, Journal of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Research.

abstract={Obesity is a well-documented risk factor for breast cancer. Several hypotheses were proposed to explain the molecular mechanism through which the obesity contributes to breast cancer risk. Because obesity also increases the risk for metabolic syndrome and diabetes, factors such as insulin-like growth factor-1, adiponectin, adiponectin receptor 1, leptin, leptin receptor, and fat mass and obesity candidate genes were explored in various case-control studies. In these studies, a link between the diabetes- and obesity-associated genes with breast cancer risk were demonstrated. Because adipose tissue contributes to peripheral estrogen synthesis, increased catechol estrogens contribute to the breast cancer risk; xenobiotic genetic polymorphisms were also explored to explain the obesity-mediated breast cancer risk. Further, the obesity was also reported to induce certain epigenetic alterations that predispose to breast cancer risk.

abstract={Aryl-ether amine based simple Schiff base molecules (1-5) showed aggregation induced enhanced emission (AIEE) in the solid state and rare stimuli responsive fluorescence off-on switching. The hard grounding of 1 resulted in irreversible fluorescence tuning from greenish-yellow to green. Heating or solvent exposure did not result in any fluorescence reversibility. Interestingly, the hard grounding of 2-5 led to the quenching of the solid state fluorescence and heating/solvent exposure produced clear bright fluorescence. Importantly, 2-5 exhibited reversible off-on fluorescence switching for several cycles without significant change in fluorescence intensity. It is noted that the turn-on fluorescence of 2-5 was slightly blue shifted compared to the initial solids. PXRD studies suggest that the switching of dark to bright fluorescence and vice versa of 2-5 is due to the reversible change of crystalline to amorphous phase and more planarization of the twisted structure. Single crystal analysis of 1 and 5 confirmed the twisted molecular conformation and strong intermolecular interactions in the crystal lattice, which led to AIEE by restricting free rotation and rigidifying the fluorophores in the solid state. The high contrast dark and bright fluorescence switching of 2-5 could be of potential interest in optoelectronic applications. © 2015 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={Regulations on automotive emissions are becoming increasingly stringent owing to the toxicity of gases like NOx, CO and unburned hydrocarbons. This brings the need for catalytic converters that convert the nitrogen oxides, CO and hydrocarbons to less harmful components. Steady state pseudo-homogeneous models for packed bed reactors have been developed earlier, taking into account the catalytic reduction of NO in the presence of CO. However, these models do not capture the transient behaviour of the reactor in real time systems. This project aims at developing a suitable transient model that is not computationally expensive but at the same time satisfactorily explains the behaviour of the converter at various operating conditions. The effect of the various operating parameters on the exit concentrations has also been studied. The major advantage of this system is that it takes into account the formation of N2O as an undesirable by-product, during the reduction of NO. It also captures the selectivity of N2 formation under various conditions, and is expected to be useful in predicting start-up emissions of the vehicle.},

abstract={In view of documented evidence showing glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII) inhibitors as promising anti-cancer agents, certain variants of GCPII modulate breast and prostate cancer risk, and we developed an artificial neural network (ANN) model of GCPII variants and ascertained the risk associated with eight genetic variants of GCPII. In parallel, an in silico model was developed to substantiate the ANN simulations. The ANN model with modified sigmoid function was used for disease prediction, whereas the hyperbolic tangent function was used to predict folate hydrolase 1 (FOLH1) and prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) expression. PyMOL models of GCPII variants were developed, and their affinity toward the folylpolyglutamate (FPG) ligand was tested using glide score analysis. Of the eight genetic variants of GCPII, p.P160S alone conferred protection against both of the cancers. This variant exhibited higher affinity toward FPG compared with wild GCPII (-2.06 vs. -1.69); and positive correlation was observed between the P160S variant and circulating folate (r = 0.60). The ANN model for disease prediction showed significant predictability associated with GCPII variants toward breast cancer (area under the curve (AUC): 1.00) and prostate cancer (AUC: 0.97), with clear distinguishing ability of healthy controls (AUC: 0.96). The ANN models for the expression of FOLH1 and PSMA explained 60.5% and 86.7% of the variability, respectively. Thus, GCPII variants are potential contributors of risk toward breast cancer and prostate cancer. Risk modulation appeared to be mediated through changes in the expression of FOLH1 and PSMA. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

The original image and the subsequent sub-pixel shifted image, subjected to image registration is transferred to SVD domain. An enhanced method of choosing the singular values from the SVD domain images to reconstruct a high resolution image using fusion techniques is proposesed. This technique is called as enhanced SVD based fusion. Significant improvement in the performance is observed by applying enhanced SVD method preceding the various interpolation methods which are incorporated.

abstract={Objectives: This paper presents an influences of process parameters on micro hardness of electrodeposited Nickelslag powder composite coating based on Taguchi's experimental design, signal to noise ratio and analysis of variances. Methods: Nickel-slag powder composite coatings are produced by conventional type electro deposition on mild steel substrate. The primary parameters; current density, pH, bath temperature, particle concentration and agitation speed are considered for experimental investigations. The experimental design is framed by L27 orthogonal array of Taguchi's model based on five parameters with three levels. The experiments are conducted in Watt's type nickel bath. Findings: The micro hardness values of coating were determined using Vickers micro hardness tester. The micro hardness of the Ni-Slag coating was obtained in the span of 190 to 358 Hv. The significances of process parameters on micro hardness of coating were investigated with signal to noise ratio and analysis of variances, and ranked by order. It is observed that bath concentration and agitation speed are the most influencing factors on micro hardness. Application: Taguchi's experimental approach reduces the experimental trails and contributing a greater advantage with reduced experimental time and cost of experimentation. Statistical investigations extend the reliability of an experimental work instead of conventional and randomized testing procedures.},

The image information can be figured out by traversing across various paths or pixel positions. Analysis of these traversal or scanning paths directs the user to the best path which helps to achieve finest compression. For this purpose, calculation of three parameters, which give an idea of how far the image is compressed, is crucial. Experimentation on several images of different sizes and textures unfolds the best traversal path. Once the best scanning traversal path is identified, it is compressed using Huffman coding technique. Generally, this method can be applied for compression of radiographic images, X-ray imaging of various human body parts and in medical imaging. Compression techniques can also be used in many areas including technical drawing and transfer of images through the internet. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Regulations on automotive emissions are becoming increasingly stringent owing to the toxicity of gases like NOx, CO and unburned hydrcoarbons. This brings the need for catalytic converters that convert the nitrogen oxides, CO and hydrcoarbons to less harmful components. Steady state pseudo-homogeneous models for packed bed reactors have been developed earlier, taking into account the catalytic reduction of NO in the presence of CO. However, these models do not capture the transient behaviour of the reactor in real time systems. This project aims at developing a suitable transient model that is not computationally expensive but at the same time satisfactorily explains the behaviour of the converter at various operating conditions. The effect of the various operating parameters on the exit concentrations has also been studied. The major advantage of this system is that it takes into account the formation of N2O as an undesirable by-product, during the reduction of NO. It also captures the selectivity of N2 formation under various conditions, and is expected to be useful in predicting start-up emissions of the vehicle. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop a mathematical model for optimizing the metal removal rate (MRR) through Response Surface Methodology (RSM). The developed model helps us to analyze the influence of individual input machining parameters (cutting speed, feed rate, weight percentage) on the responses in machining of Al-TiB2 composite. Design/methodology/approach - RSM is used to optimize the MRR by developing a mathematical model. Three factors, three-level box Behnken design matrix in RSM is employed to carry out the experimental investigation.

abstract={Background: Modeling protein-protein interactions (PPIs) using docking algorithms is useful for understanding biomolecular interactions and mechanisms. Typically, a docking algorithm generates a large number of docking poses, and it is often challenging to select the best native-like pose. A further challenge is to recognize key residues, termed as hotspots, at protein-protein interfaces, which contribute more in stabilizing a protein-protein interface.Results: We had earlier developed a computer algorithm, called PPCheck, which ascribes pseudoenergies to measure the strength of PPIs. Native-like poses could be successfully identified in 27 out of 30 test cases, when applied on a separate set of decoys that were generated using FRODOCK. PPCheck, along with conservation and accessibility scores, was able to differentiate ‘native-like and non-native-like poses from 1883 decoys of Critical Assessment of Prediction of Interactions (CAPRI) targets with an accuracy of 60%. PPCheck was trained on a 10-fold mixed dataset and tested on a 10-fold mixed test set for hotspot prediction. We obtain an accuracy of 72%, which is in par with other methods, and a sensitivity of 59%, which is better than most existing methods available for hotspot prediction that uses similar datasets. Other relevant tests suggest that PPCheck can also be reliably used to identify conserved residues in a protein and to perform computational alanine scanning. Conclusions: PPCheck webserver can be successfully used to differentiate native-like and non-native-like docking poses, as generated by docking algorithms. The webserver can also be a convenient platform for calculating residue conservation, for performing computational alanine scanning, and for predicting protein-protein interface hotspots. While PPCheck can differentiate the generated decoys into native-like and non-native-like decoys with a fairly good accuracy, the results improve dramatically when features like conservation and accessibility are included. The method can be successfully used in ranking/scoring the decoys, as obtained from docking algorithms. © The authors, publisher and licensee Libertas Academica Limited.},

abstract={Nonlinear magnetic excitation in terms of solitary waves and solitons in ferromagnetic systems is well studied problem in the literature. The results reveal that the dynamics is governed by Landau - Lifshitz (LL) equation which can be mapped to Nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) family of equations [1]. Studies with spin transfer torque in both multilayer system and single layer system has attracted much interest in the past several years [2, 3]. The result shows that spin current plays a crucial role on the dynamics of ferromagnetic system. In recent years, the study on nonlinear systems with spatial periodicity has become a great topic of interest. BEC in optical lattices, solitons in Photonic lattices and periodic magnetic systems etc., are the typical models among them [4]. Motivated by the above considerations, we investigate the nonlinear localized magnetic excitations in one dimensional magnonic crystal under periodic magnetic field with spin current. Magnonic crystal is a medium with spatially periodic variation of their magnetic properties in a definite direction. The governing modified Landau - Lifshitz (LL) equation of magnonic crystal with spin current is [5], ∂M(r, t)/ ∂t = -γ(M(r, t) x H<inf>eff</inf>) + τ (1) where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio, M(r, t) is the magnetization of the magnonic crystal medium and H<inf>eff</inf> is the effective field. The effective field is in general sum of several components includes the exchange field, Anisotropy field, demagnetization field and applied field which can all be space dependent. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Objectives: Vitamin K is a potent regulator of vascular dynamics and prevents vascular calcification. Vitamin K is increasingly being recognized for its antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties. Recently we demonstrated that vitamin K1 (5 mg/kg) protects against streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetes and diabetic cataract. The aim of this study was to determine whether the hypoglycemic action of vitamin K1 could inhibit early-onset diabetic nephropathy in a streptozotocin-induced rat kidney. Methods: Male Wistar rats were administered with 35 mg/kg STZ and after 3 days were treated with vitamin K1 (5 mg/kg, twice a week) for 3 months. Blood glucose was monitored once a month. At the end of the study, animals were sacrificed and kidney was dissected out and analysed for free radicals, antioxidants, aldose reductase, membrane ATPases, histopathology evaluation and expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Urea, uric acid, creatinine, albumin and insulin levels were also estimated. Results: Treatment of diabetic rats with vitamin K1 resulted in a decrease in blood glucose and prevented microalbuminuria. Vitamin K1 also reduced oxidative stress and protected renal physiology by modulating Ca2+ and Na+/K+-ATPases. Vitamin K1 inhibited renal inflammation by reducing nuclear factor-κB and inducible nitric oxide synthase. Interleukin-10 levels were increased in renal tissues, suggesting the ability of vitamin K1 to trigger antiinflammatory state. The hypoglycemic action of vitamin K1 could have an indirect effect by inhibiting early-onset diabetic nephropathy triggered by high blood glucose. Conclusion: Vitamin K1 could be an important nutrient based interventional strategy for early onset diabetic nephropathy. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Biofilm formation and the yeast to hyphal switch are considered to be important virulence factors of Candida albicans. The present study reports about the potential of usnic acid, a lichen secondary metabolite inhibiting these virulent factors. Usnic acid, at its biofilm inhibitory concentration (BIC) largely reduced the viability of the metabolically active cells in matured C. albicans biofilms, exhibited significant biofilm inhibition (65%) and prevented the property of adhesion. Light microscopic images revealed that usnic acid effectively inhibited the yeast to hyphal switch and confocal microscopy showed that usnic acid greatly reduced the thickness of matured biofilms. Furthermore, usnic acid was able to reduce various sugars present in the exopolysaccharide layer (EPS) which was also confirmed by FT-IR analysis. Taken together, the present study showcases usnic acid as a potent anti-virulent compound against C. albicans and opens up a new avenue for bioprospecting lichen secondary metabolites as anti-virulent compounds. © 2015 Elsevier GmbH.},

abstract={Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) is a globally widespread human infection caused by an infestation of uropathogens. Eventhough, Escherichia coli is often quoted as being the chief among them, Staphylococcus aureus involvement in UTI especially in gestational UTI is often understated. Staphylococcal accessory regulator A (SarA) is a quorum regulator of S. aureus that controls the expression of various virulence and biofilm phenotypes. Since SarA had been a focussed target for antibiofilm agent development, the study aims to develop a potential drug molecule targeting the SarA of S. aureus to combat biofilm associated infections in which it is involved. In our previous studies, we have reported the antibiofilm activity of SarA based biofilm inhibitor, (SarABI) with a 50% minimum biofilm inhibitory concentration (MBIC50) value of 200 μg/mL against S. aureus associated with vascular graft infections and also the antibiofilm activity of the root ethanolic extracts of Melia dubia against uropathogenic E. coli. In the present study, in silico design of a hybrid molecule composed of a molecule screened from M. dubia root ethanolic extracts and a modified SarA based inhibitor (SarABIM) was undertaken. SarABIM is a modified form of SarABI where the fluorine groups are absent in SarABIM. Chemical synthesis of the hybrid molecule, 4-(Benzylamino)cyclohexyl 2-hydroxycinnamate (henceforth referred to as UTI Quorum-Quencher, UTIQQ) was then performed, followed by in vitro and in vivo validation. The MBIC50 and MBIC90 of UTIQQ were found to be 15 μg/mL and 65 μg/mL respectively. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) images witnessed biofilm reduction and bacterial killing in either UTIQQ or in combined use of antibiotic gentamicin and UTIQQ. Similar results were observed with in vivo studies of experimental UTI in rat model. So, we propose that the drug UTIQQ would be a promising candidate when used alone or, in combination with an antibiotic for staphylococcal associated UTI. © 2015 P, M, Kaur, V, P_c, M_n and Princy.},

abstract={The current work was intended for the formulation design and characterization of nanoparticles to obtain controlled release of the oral antidiabetic drug, Metformin. It is, however, associated with certain adversities, which can be surmounted by designing novel delivery forms for the drug. The nanoparticles of Metformin were prepared using Ethylcellulose (EC), poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), and Chitosan as polymers. The formulated nanoparticles were subjected to in-vitro characterisation techniques for compatability studies between drug and polymer, size, surface morphology and release characteristics. The in-vitro characterisation results have shown that there were no possible chemical interaction between the drug and polymers and SEM revealed that the nanoparticles were spherical in shape with good surface morphology. The release studies were carried out up to 220 hours and, based on the release characteristics, chitosan was chosen as the best polymer. Thus the polymeric nanoparticle system can be considered as an effective delivery system for Metformin, which would deliver the drug at a controlled rate for a prolonged period of time. This can help to overcome the shortcomings of the conventional antidiabetic drugs and provide better therapeutic efficacy.},

abstract={Abstract Ca<inf>0.5</inf>La(MoO<inf>4</inf>)<inf>2</inf>:Ln3+ phosphors, where Ln = 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 mol% of Eu, Tb, or Dy, were successfully synthesized by a conventional solid-state reaction method at 900 °C for 3 h. The Ca<inf>0.5</inf>La(MoO<inf>4</inf>)<inf>2</inf>:Ln3+ phosphors exhibit a scheelite tetragonal crystal structure belonging to the I4<inf>1</inf>/a space group. The strong absorption bands seen in Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra confirm that F<inf>2</inf>(ν<inf>3</inf>) modes of vibration are IR active. The photoluminescence(PL) spectra reveal that, under optical excitation, the as-synthesized phosphors show high intensity narrow emission bands in the red (615 nm), and green (545 nm), and yellow (570 nm) regions for samples doped with Eu3+, Tb3+, and Dy3+ ions, respectively. The critical concentrations of Eu3+, Tb3+, and Dy3+ as dopants in Ca<inf>0.5</inf>La(MoO<inf>4</inf>)<inf>2</inf> were found to be 16, 12 and 12 mol%, respectively. Thereafter, concentration quenching effect occurred in the solid solutions. The fluorescence decay times for the major transitions of 5D<inf>0</inf> → 7F<inf>2</inf>, 5D<inf>4</inf> → 7F<inf>5</inf>, and 4F<inf>9/2</inf> → 6H<inf>13/2</inf> were estimated for different doping concentrations of Eu3+, Tb3+, and Dy3+ in Ca<inf>0.5</inf>La(MoO<inf>4</inf>)<inf>2</inf>, respectively. To determine the color purity and emission quality of the phosphor, photometric parameters such as color chromaticity coordinates, color correlated temperature (CCT), color rendering index (CRI), and luminous efficacy of radiation (LER) were estimated using the spectral energy distribution functions of the Ca<inf>0.5</inf>La(MoO<inf>4</inf>)<inf>2</inf>:Ln3+ phosphors. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

The essential oil extracted from C. tamala, however, varies in phytochemical constituents and concentration of its components with changing geographical and climatic conditions. GC-FID and GC-MS analysis of leaf essential oil from C. tamala specimen obtained from East Siang District, Arunachal Pradesh, revealed eugenol (60.2%), á-Phellandrene (11.7%) and â-Phellandrene (7.2%), á-Pinene (2.8%), Elixene (1.8%), cis-Caryophyllene (1.6%), Myrcene (1.5%) and Limonene (1.4%) as its major constituents.

In this paper, image processing techniques have been used for detection of diseases in fruits and classification has been performed using neural network pattern reorganization toolbox in MATLAB. The proposed method consists of K-Mean clustering for image segmentation and Speeded up Robust Features (SURF) for feature extraction. Three diseases of apple namely, Blotch, Rot and Scab have been selected here. Images are classified based on their feature analysis, namely, color, area, perimeter and boundary. Neural network classifies the images based on obtaining feature's value by using two-layer feed-forward network, with sigmoid hidden layer and output neurons. The results show 85% accurate performance of detection of diseases in the fruit.},

abstract={Phishing is an endeavor by an individual or a gathering to steal individual secret data, for example, credit card information, passwords, and so on, from innocent victims for fraudulent activities, identity theft and other financial gain. In this paper, we have proposed another methodology called "Visual cryptography based Novel anti-phishing framework" to take care of the issue of phishing. Here, classifier based verification is utilized. The utilization of session based cryptography is investigated to safeguard the security of picture captcha by disintegrating the first picture (original) captcha into two grants that are secured in discrete database servers such that the first picture captcha can be revealed exactly when both are at the same time available; the individual sheet pictures don't uncover the personality of the first picture captcha. Once the first picture captcha is uncovered to the client it can be used as the secret word (password).The proposed model sends a email for a text and color combination and takes only a fraction of the time. It is also maintained for session by session and hence it is not so easily breakable like the cypher text based ones. The color combo is resistant to a number of phishing attacks and is resilient to keyboard logging as well. The classifier model will also be able to identify any types of attacks in the future. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={In recent years, an industrial and commercial system with higher efficiency and greater performance implies great advantages of robot technology. The most common robot used in industry today is the robot arm. Kinematics analysis has been considered the initial step in the design of robotic arm. It provides information on the accurate position of each link within the robotic mechanical system. In this paper, four degree of freedom robotic arm has been designed and its kinematics analysis is done by Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) algorithm, analytic method and the Robo analyzer. The designed robotic arm is used in the application of object detection with the help of laser rangefinder which can provide the accurate and fast response in the distance measurement of the object from it. The shape of the object is detected by Hough transform algorithm and line fitting algorithm. The LPC2138 arm controller is used to control the movement of the robotics arm. The four servo motor act as an actuators for the base, arm, shoulder and elbow joints. The program is developed in C language for the rotation of the base motor, arm motor, shoulder motor and elbow motor to get the desired positions for the inverse kinematics. It is able to detect the shape of object and can be used in the noisy environmental data with help of the robotic arm. The developed system is found to work satisfactorily.},

In the case of max-min composition, it has already been proved that if L is a fuzzy regular language, then for any αϵ [0, 1], Lα = L (Dα (M)). In the case of max-product composition Lα is only a subset of L (Dα (M)). But still Myhill Nerode theorem has been extended to max-product composition [4]. In the case of max-average composition, Lα is not even contained in L (Dα(M)). This lead to lots of challenges and we had to resort to splitting to prove the analogue of Myhill Nerode Theorem for max-average composition. In a similar line, an attempt has been made in this paper to study the behavior of fuzzy automata under min-min composition and to prove the analogue of Myhill Nerode theorem for min - min composition. © Research India Publications.},

Social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter discovered the growth of data which will be uncontrollable in the future. In order to manage the huge volume of data, the proposed method will process the data in parallel as small chunks in distributed clusters and aggregate all the data across clusters to obtain the final processed data. In Hadoop framework, MapReduce is used to perform the task of filtering, aggregation and to maintain the efficient storage structure. The data are preferably refined using collaborative filtering, under the prediction mechanism of particular data needed by the user. The proposed method is enhanced by using the techniques such as sentiment analysis through natural language processing for parsing the data into tokens and emoticon based clustering. The process of data clustering is based on user emotions to get the data needed by a specific user.

abstract={In this study, the optimization of process parameters for milling of glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) composites using grey relational analysis has been investigated. Experiments are conducted using helix angle, spindle speed, feed rate, depth of cut and fiber orientation angle as typical process parameters. The grey relational analysis (GRA) is adopted to obtain grey relational grade for milling process with multiple characteristics namely machining force and delamination factor. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is performed to get the contribution of each parameter on the performance characteristics and it is observed that fiber orientation angle and feed rate are the most significant process parameters that affect the milling of GFRP composites. The experimental results reveal that, the helix angle of 25o, spindle speed of 3000 rpm, feed rate of 500 mm/min, depth of cut of 1 mm and fiber orientation angle of 15o is the optimum combination for lower machining force and lower delamination factor. The experimental results for the optimal setting show that there is considerable improvement in the process. © 2015 National Institute of Science Communication and Information Resources (NISCAIR).

Conventionally, most of the transceiver designs are based on the sum power constraint (SPC).However, in practical SPC is not realistic as it does not take into account of power constraint of an individual power amplifier. To solve this problem, under perfect CSI, per antenna power constraint is formulated into an optimization problem giving a novel joint linear transceivers that minimizes the mean square error at the output of the decoder. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme has a near-optimum performance considering practical constraints. © 2015 C. Manikandan et al.},

abstract={Objective: A major limitation in gene delivery applications employing nanocarriers is the inflammatory response elicited when administered in vivo. The mode of complexation of the oligonucleotide with the carrier can alter its interactions with biomolecules, a fact that has not been explored for lipoplexes hitherto. Materials: Liposomes prepared by thin film hydration were used to form lipoplexes of si-RNA and DNA, which exhibited a smaller size and a shift toward negative zeta potential when compared with blank liposomes. Results: The oligonucleotides wrap over the liposome surface and the surface coverage depends on the number of base pairs. The colloidal stability, protein resistance and cell uptake of lipoplexes were found to be dependent on surface charge and PEG. The lipoplexes with si-RNA did not induce cytokine production in BALB/c mice. Conclusion: The results highlight the importance of PEGylation for achieving good protein resistance without compromising cell uptake and therapeutic efficiency. © 2015 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={The study of atmospheric emissions like Airglow, Aurora etc, are essential to understand the theory and behavior of atmosphere. The Compact Airglow photometer (CAP) is one of the Fabry-Perot (FP) etalon based optical instruments which is capable of detecting the faint airglow emissions from sky in the presence of bright background light (which may be Sun or moon light). This is achieved by capturing the circular fringes of the required emissions, formed by the Fabry-Perot (FP) etalon as images along with the background using a Charge Coupled Device (CCD). The paper purports to the development of data acquisition unit for Compact photometer for terrestrial and planetary emissions using LabVIEW Software. The data acquisition unit interfaces CCD with any personal computer. The system is capable of subtracting the dark noise from each CCD frame (obtained at every 100 ms minimum) and integrating them for the desired time. It is also capable of selecting and counting the photons falling on two rectangular portions at any region in the CCD image plane separately. For each wavelength, two regions, one with fringe (Signal + Background) and other without fringe (Background alone) have been identified. Subtraction of the latter from the former will give the intensities of the airglow emissions at desired wavelengths (signal). © 2015 Hindustan University.},

These thermocouples are capable of withstanding high neutron dosage as well as γ radiation. The thermocouples are susceptible to de-calibration after prolonged exposure to such harsh environment. The surface of the thermocouples also becomes radioactive, making it difficult to take them, out for calibration in a lab. Hence, it is essential to have some automatic means of calibrating them to ensure the measurements made by these thermocouples are within the accuracy limits. The performance and characteristics of the thermocouples is known early enough before effecting plant’s measurement process using Cross-calibration technique online and in-situ. Cross-calibration technique has evolved as one of the best online techniques and can be easily implemented in the plant computer uses different sensors determining the same process parameter for calibration.

To utilize the reviews effectively, researchers are working on necessary methods and ideas such as classification of positive and negative sense of reviews, ranking the facet in the reviews to make the effective classification etc. This study aims to propose a novel facet identification namely Facet Based Adjective identification method (FBAI) for efficient feature selection of reviews. The next algorithm FacetRank marks facet of each opinion from review set with positive, negative and neutral polarity. To classify the ranked facets, a novel Cluster based k Nearest Neighbor (C-kNN) algorithm is proposed. Constrained single pass clustering algorithm is combined with existing kNN classification algorithm to classify the review set as positive or negative. C-kNN reduces the resemblance checking calculation and can process high dimensional data which enable dynamic classification. This analysis takes household product reviews as input data set. The ranked review set (using FBAI+FacetRank) is given to kNN and C-kNN for classification. F1 score of C-kNN 2.43 % higher than kNN. Linear time complexity of C-kNN achieved is 68% of kNN. © 2015 NSP Natural Sciences Publishing Cor.},

abstract={Snake venom is a complex mixture of biologically and pharmacologically active components, comprising hydrolytic enzymes, non-enzymatic proteins/peptides, and small amounts of organic and inorganic molecules. The venom components are known to vary with geographic location, season, species and age of the snakes. The role of the venom in the snake is not primarily for self-defense, but in prey immobilization and its subsequent digestion. Hence, several digestive enzymes in venoms, in addition to their hydrolytic activity have evolved to interfere in diverse physiological processes that help in the immobilization of prey/victim. As snake components are capable of modulating the physiological response of envenomated prey/victim, they show promise as potential pharmacological tools, as drug leads and in diagnostic applications. This, in a practical sense to be a reality has to be linked to the advances in toxinology that provide investigators with an understanding of the pharmacodynamics of toxins together with improved understanding of the etiology of many human diseases and identification of potential sites for therapeutic intervention. This review aims at providing an overview on snake venom toxins and their derivatives that have potential anti-angiogenic effects for cancer treatment. Some of the anti-angiogenic components of snake venom like Snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs), Disintegrins, Phospholipases A2 (PLA2), CType Lectins (CLP), Vascular Apoptosis inducing Proteins (VAP) and L-Amino Acid Oxidases (LAAO) are discussed. This review aims at giving an overall view of these molecules and their mechanism of action as an effective antiangiogenic agent towards the treatment of cancer. © 2015 Bentham Science Publishers.},

In this background, we decided to study the effect of fenugreek seeds on control of diabetes mellitus. Methods: Sixty patients of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (HbA1C of more than 7.5) reporting to our institute were included in the study. They were randomized to receive either 30 gm of fenugreek seeds thrice a day for 8 weeks (group F) or nil intervention (Group C). The pre and the post HbA1c levels were recorded. Any side effects were noted. Results: All sixty patients completed the study. The demographic variables, the pre HbA1C levels were similar between the groups (p>0.05). Patients of both control and fenugreek group showed reduction of HbA1c. The difference in reduction is significant in group F. i.e there was more reduction of HbA1c in patients treated with fenugreek seeds (p<0.05). There were no significant side effects in either group. Conclusion: Daily administration of 30 gm of fenugreek seeds in divided doses decreased HbA1C levels in uncontrolled diabetes mellitus without significant side effects. © 2015, Sphinx Knowledge House.

abstract={Objectives: To evaluate the changing trends in antimicrobial susceptibility rate and detection of ESBL and MBL among Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from various ocular infections over a 2 year periods with special reference to detection of ESBL and MBL co-existence among P aeruginosa recovered from ocular infections. Methods: All ocular specimens, culture positive for P aeruginosa (n=110) isolated from clinically suspected patients were submitted to L &T Microbiology Research Centre, Chennai, TN, India. Culture, antimicrobial susceptibility testing and ESBL detection was performed by Standard methods. MBL production was screened by Carbapenem-EDTA combination disk method. Results: Of the 3247 samples subjected to culture from August 2012– July 2014 by standard method 276 were positive for bacterial growth, thereby 8.5% of ocular infections mediated by bacterial pathogens. Out of 276 culture positives 110 (39.8%) Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates recovered from ocular infections. The resistance rate for commonly used drugs against ocular infection includes Gentamycin [23.63%], Gatifloxacin [20.9%], Moxifloxacin [20%], Tobramycin [20%], ciprofloxacin [19.09%]. Totally 15 (13.63%) out of 110 isolates were identified as ESBL producer and 11 (10%) out of 110 isolates were identified as MBL producer by screening test, including 7 isolates have co-produced both ESBL and MBL enzymes and 4 isolates were only positive for MBL production. Conclusion: Though fluoroquinolones remains a good choice for ocular Pseudomonal infection. Gradual emergence of resistance to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides also noted from this study. The emergence of ESBL, MBL and pandrug resistance among P aeruginosa from ocular infections is an alarm rational finding which necessitates the earlier detection of both ESBL and MBL production as individual or co-existence in ocular isolates, which may pave the way for appropriate therapy for sight threatening conditions like endophthalmitis. © 2015, International Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences.

This paper proposes an image processing techniques, to detect and classif y porosity like defects the butt welds in steel tubes. Typically, porosity can occur in various locations, and various configurations in a weld. In this work, these algorithms are developed using the radiographic image. Digital radiographic images of pulsed arc semi-automatic welded joints are used in this study. The results show that all the defects which are evaluated manually by human inspectors are detected by the proposed method. This study also shows that, in the case of weld images, the parameters used for various image processing operations play a crucial role in the accuracy of defect detection. © Research India Publications.},

The investors, both domestic and international, are able to optimize portfolio diversification through multi-country investments. Emerging market economies are removing the reins of investment and introduce investor responsive policies to draw overseas finance in the form of FDI or equity participation. Thus, free and perfect capital mobility has become the important feature of highly integrated financial markets. In this context we investigated the degree and direction of capital market integration among select South Asian countries. We found that the markets have long-run interdependency among themselves and the short-run dynamics is significant in few cases.

abstract={The advent of high-speed Internet connections has revolutionized the way research is being carried out to obtain relevant information. Conversely, retrieving pertinent information from the copious resources available is not only difficult but also time consuming. In the recent years, tagging activity has been perceived as a potential source of knowledge on personal preferences, interests, targets, goals, and other attributes. Tags allow users to effectively annotate resources using keywords to personalize their recommendations and organize the resources for easy retrieval. However, the preference of users varies extremely resulting in tagging being counterproductive. These shortcomings reduce the application of the tagging system for filtering as well as retrieval of information. The tag recommendation system becomes useful by suggesting a set of relevant keywords to annotate the resources. This paper presents a review of the tag recommendation systems and the constraints that affects the available tag recommendation systems. Furthermore, we propose the use of spreading activation algorithm to study the role of constructed topic ontology for efficient tag recommendations. This approach is founded on the assumption that tags that are recommended to the user are predicted from the extracted keywords from the existing blogs and the topics in constructed topic ontology. We have also proposed a tag classification system, namely Correlation-based Feature Selection-Hybrid Genetic Algorithm and classifier HGA-SVM (support vector machine), and have compared the results with results produced by other existing feature selection methods. The results obtained from the experiments have been presented. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Positioning is one of the key components in the field of ubiquitous and pervasive computing technologies. Determining the location of a person or an object in an unknown environment is useful in many applications especially in emergency and for security purpose. Conventional Radio frequency positioning requires fixed known position of the receivers to locate a target in indoor environment. But Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) does not require the knowledge of receiver’s position but it can be obtained by providing input to MDS as similarity or dissimilarity of object (target) under investigation. This paper concentrates on the implementation of accurate and inexpensive indoor localization using classical MDS for Ultra Wide Band (UWB) radio. Input to the classical MDS is square of the proximities matrix. The proximities are collected from Time difference of Arrival (TDOA) positioning technique using General Cross Correlation (GCC) method. MDS solution gives two dimensional (2D) and three dimensional (3D) spatial configurations of the target or targets. The accuracy of the classical MDS algorithm is improved by stress analysis. The performance of the proposed technique is found to be better in terms of accuracy. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Ultrasound images often exhibit poor signal to noise ratio when compared with optical images, because of the presence multiplicative speckle noise. Speckle suppression is often carried out as a pre-processing step to aid in diagnosis using ultrasound images. In this study, dual tree complex wavelet transform-based Levy Shrink algorithm is proposed for denoising ultrasound images. The coefficients in each wavelet subband are modelled using a heavy tailed Levy distribution. The scale parameters of the Levy distribution are estimated using fractional moments. Within this framework, a Bayesian estimator is employed to denoise ultrasound images. The proposed Levy Shrink algorithm is verified using evaluation parameters such as peak signal to noise ratio, mean structural similarity index, correlation coefficient and equivalent number of looks. The efficiency of the proposed denoising algorithm is justified by conducting extensive experiments on real as well as simulated ultrasound images. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2015.},

abstract={The evolution equation of a ferromagnetic spin system described by Heisenberg nearest-neighbour interaction is given by Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation, which is a fascinating nonlinear dynamical system. For a nanomagnetic trilayer structure (spin valve or pillar) an additional torque term due to spin-polarized current has been suggested by Slonczewski, which gives rise to a rich variety of dynamics in the free layer. Under appropriate conditions the spin-polarized current gives a time-varying resistance to the magnetic structure thereby inducing magnetization oscillations of frequency which lies in the microwave region. Such a device is called a spin transfer nanooscillator (STNO). However, this interesting nanoscale level source of microwaves lacks efficiency due to its low emitting power typically of the order of nWs. To overcome this difficulty, one has to consider the collective dynamics of synchronized arrays/networks of STNOs as suggested by Fert and coworkers so that the power can be enhanced N 2 times that of a single STNO. We show that this goal can be achieved by applying a common microwave magnetic field to an array of STNOs. In order to make the system technically more feasible to practical level integration with CMOS circuits, we establish suitable electrical connections between the oscillators. Although the electrical connection makes the system more complex, the applied microwave magnetic field drives the system to synchronization in large regions of parameter space. ©Indian Academy of Sciences.},

abstract={Salmonella enterica serovar Gallinarum causes fowl typhoid, recognized worldwide as an economically important disease. The current vaccine, 9R, lacks a complete O antigen, which is a Salmonella virulence factor, and, in addition, has a number of other less well characterized chromosomal mutations. For optimal efficacy, 9R is administered by injection. In an effort to develop a vaccine suitable for oral administration, we constructed Salmonella Gallinarum strains with a reversible O-antigen phenotype. In this scenario, the vaccine strain produces full-length O antigen at the time it is administered to birds. After the vaccine has had time to colonize internal lymphoid tissues, the O-antigen is gradually lost, resulting in an attenuated strain. We found that strains carrying single mutations conferring this phenotype, δpmi and arabinose-regulated rfc, retained virulence. However, a mutant strain carrying both of these mutations was completely attenuated and immunogenic in chickens. This work demonstrates a novel approach for developing live Salmonella vaccines for poultry. © American Association of Avian Pathologists.},

abstract={ABSTRACT: Natural hazards like landslides, earthquakes, and floods are a major deterrent to the development of mountain regions of the world. Recently, there has been a rise in the number of landslides in Western Ghats, India. Several factors cause landslides and they depend on the local geo-environmental set-up of the region. This study attempts to map the spatial distribution of landslide hazard and analyze the risk for a typical hill town, Kodaikkanal in the Western Ghats, India, facing rapid urbanization and infra-structure growth, using a weighted linear combination model in a geographic information system platform. Landslides in the region are triggered by rainfall and it is fairly uniform throughout the area. Hence, the susceptibility map is used as the hazard map. Validation of the weighted linear combination model using landslide hazard index shows that landslide density increases with the hazard class. The risk assessment matrix (RAM) is used to evaluate risk based on the land use and landslide hazard category. The land use map is reclassified by assigning damage potential for each land use feature. The risk map is classified into low, moderate, and high risk categories. Suitable control measures are suggested for various risk categories. © 2015, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Group A Streptococci (GAS) are involved in a number of life threatening diseases and biofilm formation by these pathogens are considered as an important virulence determinant as it mediates antibiotic resistance among them. In the present study, we have explored the ability of (+)-usnic acid, a lichen secondary metabolite, as an antibiofilm agent against four serotypes of Streptococcus pyogenes causing pharyngitis. Usnic acid inhibited the biofilms of M serotypes M56, st38, M89 efficiently and the biofilm of M74 to a lesser extent. Confocal imaging of the treated samples showed that usnic acid reduced the biomass of the biofilms when compared to that of the control. Fourier Transfer Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy indicated that usnic acid reduced the cellular components (proteins and fatty acids) of the biofilms. Interestingly, the FT-IR spectrum further revealed that usnic acid probably acted upon the fatty acids of the biofilms as evident from the disappearance of a peak at 2,455–2,100 cm−1 when compared to the control only in serotypes M56, st38 and M89 but not in M74. The present study shows, for the first time, that usnic acid can act as an effective antibiofilm agent against GAS. © 2014, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract={Doped or alloyed diamond-like carbon(DLC) films exhibit superior properties compared to undoped DLC films. But the choice of dopant plays a vital role in tailoring specific properties of the DLC film desired for specific application.In the present work,a comparative study has been carried out in order to bring out the effect of transition metal (TM) doped DLC film on the tribological properties.Nanocomposite DLC/TM ( TM=Ag, Ti and Ni) films were deposited by nanosecond pulsed laser deposition ( PLD) technique on to AISISS304 substrates.Films micro structure and chemical behavior was studied by glancing incidence X-ray diffraction ( GI-XRD),X-ray photoelectron spectros copy ( XPS), Raman spectroscopy and high resolution transmission electron microscopy ( HRTEM).Thesp2 and sp3 fraction inthe films are well described by electron energy loss spectroscopy ( EELS) analysis.The Raman spectra of DLC/TM films showed peak shift toward slower wave number indicating there duction of internal compressive stress.Formation of TM nanoclusters and TiC phases were confirmed in DLC/TM films by GI-XRD, XPS and HRTEM.DLC film doped with nanocrystalline Ag showed low friction behavior due to the formation of large amount of sp2 lubricant phase.However,high friction coefficient measured in DLC film doped with Niand Ti.Such a high friction is explained by the presence of hard TiC and sp3 phase in the DLC/Ti and DLC/Ni films respectively. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.All right sreserved.},

abstract={Background: School vision testing aims at identification and management of refractive errors. Large-scale school vision testing using conventional methods is time-consuming and demands a lot of chair time from the eye care professionals. A new strategy involving a school of optometry in single day large scale school vision testing is discussed. Aim: The aim was to describe a new approach of performing vision testing of school children on a large scale in a single day.
Materials and Methods: A single day vision testing strategy was implemented wherein 123 members (20 teams comprising optometry students and headed by optometrists) conducted vision testing for children in 51 schools. School vision testing included basic vision screening, refraction, frame measurements, frame choice and referrals for other ocular problems.
Results: A total of 12448 children were screened, among whom 420 (3.37%) were identified to have refractive errors. 28 (1.26%) children belonged to the primary, 163 to middle (9.80%), 129 (4.67%) to secondary and 100 (1.73%) to the higher secondary levels of education respectively. 265 (2.12%) children were referred for further evaluation.
Conclusion: Single day large scale school vision testing can be adopted by schools of optometry to reach a higher number of children within a short span. © 2015 Farjadnia M, et al.},

abstract={Objective: The aim of this study was to understand the mechanism of action of vitamin K1 against streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes. Methods: Male Wistar rats were administered 35 mg/kg STZ and after 3 d were treated with vitamin K1 (5 mg/kg, twice a week) for 3 months. Blood glucose was monitored twice a month. At the end of the study, animals were sacrificed and pancreas dissected out and analyzed for free radicals, antioxidants, metabolic enzymes related to glucose, membrane ATPases, histopathological evaluation, and expression of nuclear factor (NF)-κB and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Glycated hemoglobin, plasma insulin, and islet area were determined at the end of the study. Results: Treatment of STZ-induced type 1 diabetic rats with vitamin K1 reduced oxidative stress, enhanced antioxidants, and inhibited aldose reductase in pancreas. Vitamin K1 administration rescued endocrine pancreas from STZ-induced cell death, resulting in enhanced insulin secretion and normal blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels. Histologic analyses also showed the antidiabetic potential of vitamin K1. Measure of pancreatic islet area showed an increase in the islet area upon vitamin K1 treatment when compared with the STZ-administered group, suggesting the possibility of regeneration. To understand the mechanism involved in vitamin K1 mediated changes, we performed immunohistochemical analyses for NF-κB and iNOS enzyme. Vitamin K1 was shown to suppress NF-κB activation and iNOS expression in the islets upon administration ofSTZ. Conclusion: This work shows, to our knowledge for the first time, the mechanism of action of vitamin K1 against type 1 diabetes and the possible therapeutic use of this vitamin in stimulating islet cell proliferation/regeneration. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={We demonstrate that the synchronization of an array of electrically coupled spin torque nano-oscillators (STNO) modelled by Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski (LLGS) equation can be enhanced appreciably in the presence of a common external microwave magnetic field. The applied microwave magnetic field stabilizes and enhances the regions of synchronization in the frequency determining parameter space. We have identified two regions of synchronization in the parameter space of our analysis, where the oscillators are exhibiting synchronized oscillations thereby emitting improved microwave power. To characterize the synchronized oscillations we have calculated the locking range in the domain of external source frequency. © CopyrightEPLA, 2015.},

abstract={Toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems consist of a bicistronic operon, encoding a toxin and an antitoxin. They are widely distributed in the prokaryotic kingdom, often in multiple numbers. TAs are implicated in contradicting phenomena of persistence and programmed cell death (PCD) in bacteria. mazEF TA system, one of the widely distributed type II toxin-antitoxin systems, is particularly implicated in PCD of Escherichia coli. Nutrient starvation, antibiotic stress, heat shock, DNA damage and other kinds of stresses are shown to elicit mazEF-mediated-PCD. ppGpp and extracellular death factor play a central role in regulating mazEF- mediated PCD. The activation of mazEF system is achieved through inhibition of transcription or translation of mazEF loci. Upon activation, MazF cleaves RNA in a ribosome-independent fashion and subsequent processes result in cell death. It is hypothesized that PCD aids in perseverance of the population during stress; the surviving minority of the cells can scavenge the nutrients released by the dead cells, a kind of "nutritional-altruism." Issues regarding the strains, reproducibility of experimental results and ecological plausibility necessitate speculation. We review the molecular mechanisms of the activation of mazEF TA system, the consequences leading to cell death and the pros and cons of the altruism hypothesis from an ecological perspective. © 2015 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.},

abstract={Basic violet 3 (BV) and acid blue 93 (AB) belong to the most important group of synthetic colorants. These dyes are used extensively in textile, paper, and leather industries. It is considered as xenobiotic compound, which is recalcitrant to biodegradation. Pseudomonas putida MTCC 4910 was able to utilize BV and AB as a carbon source in liquid media. Effects of pH, temperature, NaCl concentrations, nitrogen sources, initial inoculum size, and initial dye concentration on degradation were studied. The optimum pH and temperature for the degradation of BV and AB were pH 7 and 6, and 37 and 45°C, respectively. Addition of yeast extract enhanced the degradation process. Gas chromatography-MS analysis confirmed the biodegradation of BV and AB. The products formed during the reduction of BV were N,N-dimethyl-N′,N′-dimethyl-N″-methyl parasoaniline, N,N-dimethyl-N′,N′-dimethyl-parasoaniline, N,N-dimethyl-N′,N′-methyl parasoaniline, N,N-dimethylparasoaniline, N-methyl parasoaniline and parasoaniline, and three intermediate compounds were oberved during the reduction of AB.

abstract={The band structure and electronic transport properties of InSe nanosheet with substitution impurity are studied using density functional theory. The nanostructures of InSe nanosheet exhibit metallic nature. The effect of substitution due to sulfur, tellurium and gallium influences the band structure. The density of states spectrum envisions the density of charges across the InSe nanosheet. The peak amplitudes are observed near the Fermi level and along the valence band in InSe nanosheet. The electron density provides the visualization of density of electrons across InSe nanosheet. The electron density is found to be more on selenium sites than on indium sites. The electronic transport property of InSe nanosheet molecular device is discussed in terms of transmission spectrum, an increase in transmission is observed on moving toward Fermi level along the valence band. The transmission pathways provide the visualization of transmission of electrons along InSe nanosheet.

abstract={The objective of the present work is to compare and study the effect of plant extracts of Neem (Azadirachta indica) and Tulsi (Ocimum sanctum) against Alternaria solani which causes early blight disease on tomato plants. Aqueous and ethylacetate leaf extracts of different concentrations were used. Foliar treatment of tomato plants with 30 % aqueous tulsi extract decreased the disease incidence to 40 %. Disease severity and control of pathogen after inoculation were also analyzed. The highest disease incidence was recorded as 82.1 % with test control whereas the lowest as 25.2 % with plants treated with pathogen and tulsi aqueous extract. Among the groups treated with neem 30 % concentration of aqueous extract showed beneficial effect. The aqueous extract of tulsi leaves was the best one in reducing disease severity than that of neem leaves. The increase in some biochemical parameters, pigment system and antioxidant enzymes were corresponded with the reduction of disease severity. Tulsi extracts exhibited significant control of disease progress than neem extracts. It may be suggested as a promising tool against early blight pathogens. © 2014, The National Academy of Sciences, India.},

abstract={Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is the currently employed therapeutic intervention against AIDS where a drug combination is used to reduce the viral load. The present work envisages the development of a stealth anti-CD4 conjugated immunoliposomes containing two anti-retroviral drugs (nevirapine and saquinavir) that can selectively home into HIV infected cells through the CD4 receptor. The nanocarrier was characterized using transmission electron microscopy, FTIR, differential scanning calorimetry, particle size and zeta potential. The cell uptake was also evaluated qualitatively using confocal microscopy and quantitatively by flow cytometry. The drug to lipid composition was optimized for maximum encapsulation of the two drugs. Both drugs were found to localize in different regions of the liposome. The release of the reverse transcriptase inhibitor was dominant during the early phases of the release while in the later phases, the protease inhibitor is the major constituent released. The drugs delivered via anti-CD4 conjugated immunoliposomes inhibited viral proliferation at a significantly lower concentration as compared to free drugs. In vitro studies of nevirapine to saquinavir combination at a ratio of 6.2:5 and a concentration as low as 5 ng/mL efficiently blocked viral proliferation suggesting that co-delivery of anti-retroviral drugs holds a greater promise for efficient management of HIV-1 infection. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={The present work presents experimental results of subcooled flow boiling heat transfer phenomena in minichannels. The experiments were conducted with high surface tension liquid (water), which clearly indicates that inertial effects are important for both momentum and thermal transport in minichannels. The test section is a horizontal AISI 316 stainless-steel minitube with internal diameter of 1.13 mm with uniform heated length of 250 mm and the tube is heated by AC electric current. The variation in wall temperature and pressure drop gives an indication of the different boiling regions along the axis of the horizontal tube. Based on sudden oscillations of the pressure drop and wall temperature, onset of nucleate boiling (ONB) is identified in the tube. During ONB, pressure drop and the fluctuations of fluid outlet temperature are observed near the exit of the test section. Predictive models for ONB were evaluated and Kandlikar's ONB model was found to agree well with the present data. Comparisons of experimental heat transfer coefficient in the subcooled boiling regime with the existing correlations are also presented. © 2015 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={In restructuring power markets, the money matters of demand and supply governs the prices at each bus with rigid constraints imposed in transmission line. The market operators can misuse the "market power" and make additional profit. It eventually hinders the growth of restructured power market and minimizes the social welfare. Hence Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS) devices are considered one such technology that helps in improving the social welfare. In this paper, the new methodology for proper placement of FACTS devices in the restructured electricity market is proposed. An efficient and reliable evolutionary programming (EP) and differential evolution (DE) techniques based economic dispatch for pool electricity market is used to improve the social welfare. These techniques are developed for both the cases with and without FACTS devices and the results are compared. Utilization of these FACTS devices helps in "maximizing the benefit" and "minimizing the cost" and also helps in reducing the total number of overloads, excess power flow and severity of overloading.

abstract={To authenticate the colon cancer preventive potential of silibinin, the efficacy of silibinin needs to be tested by evaluating an organ-specific biomarker. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of silibinin on the colonic expression of the caudal-type homeobox transcription factor (CDX2) an intestine specific tumor suppressor gene and its downstream targets in the colon of rats challenged with 1,2 dimethyl hydrazine (DMH). Rats of groups 1 and 2 were treated as control and silibinin control. Rats under groups 3 and 4 were given DMH (20 mg/kg body weight (b.w.) subcutaneously) once a week for 15 consecutive weeks from the 4th week of the experimental period. In addition, group 4 rats alone were treated with silibinin (50 mg/kg b.w. per os) everyday throughout the study period of 32 weeks. Histological investigation and messenger RNA and protein expression studies were performed in the colonic tissues of experimental rats. Findings of the study revealed that DMH administration significantly decreased the expression of CDX2 and Guanylyl cyclase C (GCC) in the colon of experimental rats. Further the decreased levels of CDX2 protein, colonic mucin content, and increased number of mast cells in the colon of DMH alone-administered rats reflects the onset of carcinogenesis. The pathological changes caused due to CDX2 suppression were attenuated by silibinin supplementation. © The Author(s) 2014.},

abstract={Biosynthesised iron oxide nanoparticles (INPs) less than 100 nm were used to decolourise the textile dye, Direct Orange S by the process of ultra sonication. The parameters tested for the decolourisation of the Direct Orange S dye were the INP concentration (0.2–1g/l), pH (3–11) and H2O2 concentration (2–8 ml/l). The rate of decolourisation process was performed by both stirrer and ultra sonicator method using the first-order kinetics ln(c/c0). The percentage of dye removal for the optimum conditions such as INP, 1g/l (87.2%); pH, 9 (85.5%) and H2O2 concentration 8 ml/l (86.5%) were observed. The Direct Orange S dye was degraded efficiently by sonolysis (60 min) than by the magnetic stirrer method (120 min). High-performance liquid chromatography results showed that the peak for Direct Orange S dye was not present when the dye sample was treated by either H2O2 + INP or INP alone. Use of biosynthesised iron NPs in Direct Orange S dye (azo dye) decolourisation by a simple non-toxic Fenton reaction is a safe and novel approach. Industrialisation of this technique will be an economical way to decolorise the textile dyes present in water systems. © 2013, © 2013 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={The aim of this research article is to assess and compare the reliability of spatial-based different landslide hazard zonation mapping methods in the Bodi-Bodimettu Ghat section, Theni District as a case study. In favor of this intention, the three methods like the Bureau of Indian Standard (BIS), multi-criteria analysis (MCA), and frequency ratio (FR) model have been applied to find out three different landslide hazard zonation maps. The results of the three methods were compared using parameters such as landslide density, success rate curve, and spatially agreed area. Approximately the same variation is seen in the final results of BIS in comparison to the other methods, namely MCA and FR. But if we go actually into the detail, low hazard and moderate hazard seem to merge to indicate one single zone made as moderate hazard. Moreover, the nature of weightages used in different techniques may have the same influence on the outcome of the result. © 2014, Saudi Society for Geosciences.},

abstract={Lasers have been used in several ways to transform the properties of surfaces, particularly the surfaces of metals. Most often, the intention of the processing is to harden the surface to provide a better wear resistance and fatigue life. This process is termed as transformation hardening, is applicable to certain types of steel and cast iron. Steels and cast irons are particularly good candidates for transformation hardening. Laser surface transformation hardening, commonly known as heat treating, makes use of the rapid heating and cooling rates produced on metal surfaces exposed to scanning laser beams. The process has unique advantages, particularly when used to enhance surface properties in local areas without affecting other areas of the component surface. Surface mechanical properties (hardness, abrasion, resistance, etc.) and chemical properties, (corrosion resistance, etc.) can often be greatly enhanced through the metallurgical reactions produced during these heating and cooling cycles. This chapter will describe the use of lasers and laser parameters to harden the surface of steels through rapid heating and quenching of a surface layer and the change take place in surface properties after hardening. © 2015 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

abstract={The nanospheres embedded drug delivery system uses iron oxide Fe( 2-3 )O( 3-4 ) nanoparticles coated with chitosan. Chitosan nanospheres have gained more attention as drug delivery carriers because of their better stability, low toxicity, simple, cost effective preparation method, and providing versatile routes of administration. The coating was performed simultaneously with the synthesis of the ferrite nanoparticles by poly ionic gelation method. Dynamic light-scattering (DLS) and a X-Ray Diffractometer (XRD) were used to measure the average diameter of the coated nanoparticles. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) measurements showed strong bonding of the chitosan molecules to the surfaces of the ferrite nanoparticles. Furthermore, chitosan nanospheres also have been proved to be a good adjuvant for vaccines. This work has been performed by a simple preparation technique involving chitosan nanospheres using a model drug (rose bengal) to analyze its release kinetics and to evaluate the degradation kinetics of the prepared nanospheres, the application of explored chitosan nanoparticles, and the mechanism of cell entry. © Global Science Publications.},

abstract={Bacterial biofilms display a collective lifestyle, wherein the cells secrete extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) that helps in adhesion, aggregation, stability, and to protect the bacteria from antimicrobials. We asked whether the EPS could act as a public good for the biofilm and observed that infiltration of cells that do not produce matrix components weakened the biofilm of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. EPS production was costly for the producing cells, as indicated by a significant reduction in the fitness of wild type (WT) cells during competitive planktonic growth relative to the non-producers. Infiltration frequency of non-producers in the biofilm showed a concomitant decrease in overall productivity. It was apparent in the confocal images that the non-producing cells benefit from the EPS produced by the Wild Type (WT) to stay in the biofilm. The biofilm containing non-producing cells were more significantly susceptible to sodium hypochlorite and ciprofloxacin treatment than the WT biofilm. Biofilm infiltrated with non-producers delayed the pathogenesis, as tested in a murine model. The cell types were spatially assorted, with non-producers being edged out in the biofilm. However, cellulose was found to act as a barrier to keep the non-producers away from the WT microcolony. Our results show that the infiltration of non-cooperating cell types can substantially weaken the biofilm making it vulnerable to antibacterials and delay their pathogenesis. Cellulose, a component of EPS, was shown to play a pivotal role of acting as the main public good, and to edge-out the non-producers away from the cooperating microcolony. © 2015 Srinandan, Elango, Gnanadhas and Chakravortty.},

abstract={Salinity is one of the major environmental factors limiting plant growth and productivity. Excess salt in the soil may adversely affect plant growth either through osmotic inhibition of water uptake by roots or specific ion effects. Vigna mungo was selected for the study. Different concentration of NaCl ( 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50mM) were used in test control groups and 100 mg of gibberellic acid (GA) was used in each bag of test group by foliar spray (on 14th day) and plants were analyzed 0n 30th day. The results of this study indicate that salinity impairs seed germination, retards plant development and reduces crop yield. Increase in salinity affect the growth of the Vigna mungo by decreasing germination percentage, no of leaves, shoot length, root length, dry weight, fresh weight, pigments, protein content, free amino acid, and increase in carbohydrate, proline, phenol content, catalase and super oxide dismutase activity. Among different concentration of salinity (10, 20, 30, 40 and 50mM) in the present investigation the maximum inhibition is found at 50mM. The application of GA treatment showed to increase in all the parameters decreased by salt stress and restores the increased parameters to normal value. Thus we may conclude from the present study that the application of GA alleviates the adverse effect of salinity on black gram seedlings and can be attempted in the field trials in future.},

abstract={Objective: Ocular infections caused by Multi-Drug resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa are rare but increasingly identified recently. In this context, we have applied Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) based whole genome analysis on three ocular isolates of MDR P. aeruginosa to explore the drug resistance determinants and genomic level variations. Methods: Three ocular isolates namely P. aeruginosa VRFP03, VRFPA04 from two different Keratitis patients (corneal button) and VRFPA05 isolated from the intraocular specimen (Vitreous humor) collected from an endophthalmitis patient was included in this study. Phenotypically VRFPA03, VRFPA04, VRFPA05 showed resistant to a wide group of antibiotics and hence they were taken up for Ion Torrent-PGM based whole genome study. Results: Here, we report the first complete genome sequence of MDR P. aeruginosa VRFPA04 isolated from the Indian keratitis patients clinical specimen (corneal button) submitted to L &amp; T Microbiology Research Centre, Vision Research Foundation, Sankara Nethralaya, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India. The circular chromosome of P aeruginosa VRFPA04 was published under the NCBI accession number CP008739.2. Two Draft genome sequences of MDR P. aeruginosa VRFPA03 and VRFPA05 were published under the NCBI accession number ATNK01000000.1 and AXZJ01000000.1 respectively. Conclusion: Preliminary genomic analysis on P. aeruginosa VRFPA03, VRFPA04 and VRFPA05 revealed the presence of Metallo Beta-lactamase (MBL) genes blaDim-1, blaVim-2 and blaGes-9 genes respectively. These MBL genes were concordance with a phenotypic pattern of carbapenem resistance among VRFPA03, VRFPA04 and VRFPA05 strains, respectively.

abstract={Silica nanoparticles have received an intensive attention of scientific community due to its broad applications in industry. The optical properties of silica nanoparticles can be attained with respect to surface defect related to large surface/volume ratio according to the applications. In this paper, silica nanoparticles were synthesized from tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) as a precursor and PVP as a surfactant by employing sol-gel method. By XRD measurement, a broad peak of pure amorphous nature is observed while FTIR analysis showed hygroscopic nature of particles. TEM measurement has also confirmed the amorphous structure of prepared SiO 2 nanoparticles with theiraverage diameter~25nm. The compositional ratio of silicon and oxygen is analyzed by EDX and found to be satisfactory. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Objective: Our earlier studies have characterized a compound from Melia dubia leaves, 4-ethyl resorcinol as an agonist of the Quorum Sensing (QS) receptor, CqsS agonist that had reverse engineered the QS circuit of V. cholerae from low-density to high-density state to effectively inhibit biofilm and enhance the production of protease to detach itself form the host tissue. So, the objective of this study was to synthesize structural derivatives of 4-ethyl resorcinol, to enhance its activity and to down regulate the host cell toxicity was validated. Methods: The antimicrobial (cell-density) and anti-virulent (protease, hemolysis, stress responds and biofilm inhibition) properties of the structural derivatives of 4-ethyl resorcinol were performed. Results: The results indicate that the compound has up surged protease expression along with a remarkable decrease in hemolytic activity at the 7th hour. The stress responds in treated culture has a higher survival rate while the bacterial cells in the control succumb to stress stating the potential of the drug to induce HCD (high cell density) condition in the LCD (low cell density) state. From CLSM analysis we state that there was significant amount of dead colonies and disrupted biofilm in the respective treated culture Conclusion: This could possibly open up a direction to curb the bacterial biofilm formation and may also turn out to be a potent drug against treating Vibrio cholerae infection at an early point. © 2015, International Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Science.

abstract={The primary objective of this proposal is to minimize the battery drain and to maximize the compatibility of the device so that the complexity of the device is much more reduced to enhance the battery period considerably. In this paper we adopted a method for increasing the response time using a priority based algorithm along with Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) in Reconfigurable Computing System (RCS) to handle complex applications and to increase the efficiency and throughput of the system. A primary comparison was made with all existing algorithms namely First Come First Serve (FCFS), Round Robin, Shortest Job First (SJF) for a given set of processes by taking process delay as a core parameter. The result obtained from this analysis gave a clear picture that the objective can be achieved by decreasing the waiting time and by increasing the throughput. By achieving this task, multitasking between the applications or processes can be done frequently. By adopting these kind of scheduling algorithms with programmable gate array, there is a considerable improvement and performance of the device. Also, the life span of the device is increased which is considered as most important criteria for any users in computing environment.},

abstract={In any optical system, optical aberrations of the imaging system affect the image quality. The human eye is also like an optical system which has optical aberrations influencing the quality of the retinal image. When pupil size exceeds 3 mm, ocular aberrations increase and play a major role on retinal image degradation. Pupil diameter is made constant in commercially available aberrometers by mathematically rescaling it. The aim of this study is to validate the pupil rescaling technique by using COAS (Complete Ophthalmic Analysis System)Shack Hartmann Aberrometer. Five subjects were recruited for this study. The measurements were taken over a moderately large pupil of 5mm in normal room illumination to allow for natural pupil dilation. The analyses diameter is fixed at 5 mm in COAS which means it rescales the aberration data to 5 mm if the pupil diameter recorded was more than 5 mm at the time of measurement. Ocular aberrations for natural and rescaled pupil sizes were analyzed. Estimation of ocular aberrations showed there was no statistical significance between natural pupil and rescaled pupil diameter.},

The dynamics and steering characteristics of ATPCF are numerically explored via coupled nonlinear Schrödinger equations. The extinction ratios for the various logic gate operations are determined in the presence of suitable control signal.

abstract={Objective: The objective of the present study was to evaluate the mechanism of action of the active fraction of Stereospermum tetragonum. Methods: An active fraction was isolated from the water extract (active extract by GTT) using ethanol precipitation. To get insight to the mechanism of action of the active fraction, glucose uptake by isolated rat diaphragm was performed. Further the effect of active fraction on glucose tolerance in fed rats was compared with that of fasted rats. Besides, effect of oral administration of the active fraction was compared with that of intra peritonial administration. The effect of active fraction on serum glucose levels in orally glucose loaded rats was compared with that of intra peritoneal glucose loaded rats. Results: Glucose uptake in the isolated rat hemi-diaphragm, were increased by the active fraction at 40 μg/ml concentrations, the active fraction showed promising anti hyper glycemic activity in fed rats when compared with fasted rats. The active fraction was found to be effective in orally glucose loaded in contrast to intra peritonial route. The result shows that glucose absorbtion from an intestinal tract is inhibited by the active fraction. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that this plant is promising for further studies leading to the development of valuable medicine for diabetes. © 2015, International Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Science.

abstract={The study on the absorption of toxic gases such as mustard gas by organic host is essential to the development of inexpensive detection and decontamination equipments. Using quantum chemical methods, we propose cucurbituril as an effective host to capture mustard gas. It was found that stable complexes are formed with the inclusion of the toxic gas molecules inside the cucurbituril cavity, compared with the lateral and exterior interactions. Oxygen mustard has a comparable binding energy with sulfur mustard and hence can be used during experimental investigation. Additionally, during the inclusion complex formation, the presence of heteroatoms helps the guest molecules to undergo a larger structural reorganization to get accommodated inside the cucurbituril macromolecule. Atoms-in-molecules analysis shows the existence of strong intermolecular CH⋯O bonding between the guest molecules and cucurbituril macromolecule. The presence of an intramolecular CH⋯Cl type of bonding accounts for the higher stabilization of sulfur mustard inside the cucurbituril macromolecule. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Nanotechnology has facilitated noteworthy advances in the field of medicine. Whereas a number of nanoparticle drug combinations are at various stages of preclinical or clinical assessment, the careful assessment of their toxic response is the need of the hour.

The Rg loaded polymeric nanoparticles were synthesized and characterized for particle size, drug content, entrapment efficiency and compatibility. The nanoparticles were then fed to wistar albino rats for a duration of 21 days, to assess the adversities of nanoparticles on various organs in the rats. Along with the biochemical and haematological studies, histopathological examination was done to monitor intravascular effects, and they were also tested for haemocompatibility and cytotoxicity. MTT measurement reveals that the nanoparticle treated cells are 70-80% viable. The test drug did not produce any significant histopathological changes in the cryoarchitecture of any organ studied at various dose levels. Hence our data indicates that these polymeric nanoparticles are nontoxic and provide a suitable platform for the oral delivery of the antidiabetic agent.},

abstract={Zinc oxide (ZnO) films were deposited onto glass substrates using reactive direct current magnetron sputtering technique by varying the substrate bias voltage (floating potential and -50 V) and retaining other parameters, viz., deposition time, substrate temperature, argon and oxygen flow, etc., as constant. The deposited ZnO films were doped with aluminium (Al) using thermal evaporation technique and subsequently annealed at 150°C for 2 h in ambient air. Pure and Al doped films were then investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-Visible spectroscopy, Field-Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM) and four probe method for their structural, optical, morphological and electrical properties, respectively. The films were polycrystalline in nature with hexagonal wurtzite structure. Increase in the grain size value was observed for the films deposited at -50 V substrate bias voltage as well as for the films doped with Al which in turn reduced the band gap value of the films. The band gap values of the films varied between 3.34 and 3.00 eV with respect to substrate bias voltage and Al doping. The variations in the properties of the films were correlated to the change in the micro-structural parameters due to the change in the ion energy variation influenced by the variation of substrate bias voltages. © 2015 Knowledgia Review, Malaysia.},

abstract={In the present scenario, Powder metallurgy (P/M) manufacturing process is one of the fastest growing fields which involves the processing of metal powders for the production of steels and has replaced all traditional methods of metal forming operations because of its low relative material wastage, low capital cost and maximum material utilization. Producing steels through the P/M route has immense potential for industrial applications in making components for machine parts, in the fields of automobiles such as fasteners, bearings, rollers, in manufacturing field such as tools, cutters, and also in the field of aerospace, defense etc. The microstructures and mechanical properties mainly depend on the final obtained density of sintered P/M alloy steels which will determine the component characteristics. The present study has been made to investigate the cutting tool wear behaviour of sintered/hot extruded P/M alloy steels with Fe-1% C as base material, W (Tungsten) and Ti (Titanium) as alloying elements. The cutting tool wear behavior was analyzed with the help of tool bits grounded from the head portion of extruded preforms with standard tool parameters for machining the non-ferrous materials by varying the cutting speed, whereas the feed and depth of cut was kept constant, and also the dry sliding wear behavior were studied on pin-on-disc (ASTM G99) arrangement. By using the optical microscopy (OM), the microstructure of extruded P/M alloy steels has been characterized to understand the structure-property relationships. The presence of WTi Carbide in both the extruded P/M alloy steels significantly enhances the tool wear resistance. Widmanstatten type ferrite-cementite matrix (alternate lamellas) microstructure is revealed on both the extruded P/M alloy steels. © 2015, Sphinx Knowledge House. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Disposal of Chromite Ore Processing Residue (COPR) is a major concern from an environmental point of view because it consists mainly of Cr(VI) in addition to Cr(III). Cr(VI) is more soluble and mobile when compared to Cr(III). The study primarily concentrated on treatment of COPR using solidification and stabilization (S/S) process. Prior to the S/S process, there was a need for reduction of Cr(VI) fraction present in COPR to Cr(III). In order to reduce Cr(VI) fraction present in COPR to Cr(III), experiments were carried with a variety of reducing agents like Calcium Polysulfide, Silica Gel, Gaur Gum and an optimum dose was arrived at. Further, the chemically treated COPR was solidified with Ordinary Portland Cement along with lime as the binding material in various mix proportions, with Water/COPR plus binder ratio of 0.55. The performance of the above reducing agents and S/S process was verified by conducting leaching tests like Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure, Extraction Procedure Toxicity Test, and American Nuclear Society Leach Test. With these tests, the leaching process in acidic and neutral mediums and the influence of the size of the waste particles on the reduction process as well as leaching were studied. The economics of the process was also arrived at based on cost of chemicals (reducing agents) and materials (cement, lime) needed for remediation of one tonne of COPR. © 2014 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog.},

abstract={Context: In the last half century, discovering, developing and introducing of clinical agents from marine sources have seen great successes, with examples including the anti-cancer compound trabectedin. However, with increasing need for new anticancer drugs, further exploration for novel compounds from marine organism sources is strongly justified. Objective: The major aim of this study was to evaluate the antitumor and antioxidant potential of Sargassum tenerrimum J.Agardh (Sargassaceae) on Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) in Swiss albino mice. Materials and Methods: An ethanol extract of S. tenerrimum (EEST) from whole algae was used to evaluate cytotoxicity followed by in vivo assessment of toxicity, using biochemical parameters including hepatic and non-hepatic enzymes. Antioxidant properties were examined in animals bearing EAC treated with daily oral administration of 100-300 mg/kg extract suspension. Results: Antitumor effects of EEST in EAC bearing mice was observed with LD50 1815 mg/kg. Parameters like body weight, tumor volume, packed cell volume, tumor cell count, mean survival time and increase in life span in animals in the EAC bearing animals treated with EEST 300 mg/kg was comparable with control group. Significant differences were also seen with changes in total protein content, hepatic enzymes contents, MDA level, and free radical scavenging enzymes in untreated vs. EEST treated group animals. Conclusions: Evaluation of antioxidant enzymes and hepatic enzymes in the EAC animal model treated with EEST exhibited similar effects as the positive control drug 5-flurouracil. S. tenerrimum extracts contain effective antioxidants with significant antitumor activity.},

The second case study is of a tactical flight vehicle for air-to-air application. Here a minimum fl ight time trajectory has been generated for covering a specifi ed range pertaining to a specifi ed air-to-air engagement by evolving pitch lateral acceleration as control input. Here also, there are many path and terminal constraints consisting of launch aircraft, pursuer, and evader. The studies have been carried out as part of system design activity of both fl ight vehicles. Both are real-life optimisation problems under several constraints. Through it is very diffi cult to solve such practical problems in fl ight dynamics using classical optimal control theory, it has been solved successfully using direct transcription method based on nonlinear programming. Rapid convergence has been achieved in four passes with minimum grids in fi rst pass, to start with, and increasing the grids in subsequent passes. Solving such a real-life problem with proper convergence subjected to many constraints is claimed as novelty of present research. © 2015, DESIDOC.},

abstract={In the design of irrigation and other hydraulic structures, evaluating the magnitude of extreme rainfall events is of much importance. The capacity of such structures is usually designed to cater for the prospects of incidence of extreme rainfall during the life span of the structure. In this study, an extreme value analysis of rainfall for Tiruchirapalli city in Tamil Nadu, India was carried out using 100 years of rainfall data. Weibull's plotting position formula is used in the analysis. The forecasted maximum rainfalls for the selected return periods are evaluated and the analysis will be helpful to ascertain the extreme rainfall event. The present study also aims to evaluate the consecutive days of maximum rainfalls using 100 years of daily rainfall data of Tiruchirapalli city, Tamil Nadu. This city is the fourth largest urban conglomerate of the state. From the results analysis, it is found that one day maximum rainfall for the city is obtained as 318.9 mm for 100-year return period, and that the maximum rainfall values for 2-, 3-, 4- and 5-day consecutive periods, corresponding to 100-year return period, are being obtained as 366.6 mm, 368.5 mm, 383.5 mm and 403.3 mm, respectively. Further, the study provides the rainfall amount for 10-year and 50-year return periods which will be helpful in preparing disaster mitigation and management measures in the study area. © 2015 JUST.

abstract={Doubly doped (Mn + F) zinc oxide nanopowders were synthesized using a simple soft chemical route. The F doping level was varied from 0 to 20 at.% in steps of 5 at.% and the Mn doping level was kept constant at 10 at.%. Structural, optical, surface morphological and magnetic properties of the synthesized nanopowders were investigated. The antibacterial activity was studied using well diffusion method as a function of F doping level against the Bacillus subtilis bacteria. XRD analysis ensures that the synthesized material has hexagonal wurtzite structure with preferential orientation along the (101) plane and no secondary phases were observed. Crystallite sizes were found to be increasing up to 10 at.% of F doping level and then decreasing with further doping. The shift in the NBE peak of the PL spectra and the absorption edge of the optical absorbance spectra confirmed the variation in the band gap which in turn indicated the variation in the carrier concentration caused by F doping. The SEM and TEM images showed that the size and shape of the grains are remarkably influenced by F doping. The magnetic measurements performed at room temperature showed that Mn + F doped ZnO nanopowders exhibits super paramagnetic behavior. Moreover, it was found that the antibacterial activity of doubly doped ZnO nanopowders was enhanced remarkably up to 10 at.% of F doping level and then slightly decreased with further increase in the F doping level. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={When applying the ray tracing in ionospheric propagation, the electron density modelling is the main input of the algorithm, since phase refractive index strongly depends on it. Also the magnetic field and frequency collision modelling have their importance, the former as responsible for the azimuth angle deviation of the vertical plane containing the radio wave, the latter for the evaluation of the absorption of the wave. Anyway, the electron density distribution is strongly dominant when one wants to evaluate the group delay time characterizing the ionospheric propagation. From the group delay time, azimuth and elevation angles it is possible to determine the point of arrival of the radio wave when it reaches the Earth surface. Moreover, the procedure to establish the target (T) position is one of the essential steps in the Over The Horizon Radar (OTHR) techniques which require the correct knowledge of the electron density distribution. The group delay time generally gives rough information of the ground range, which depends on the exact path of the radio wave in the ionosphere. This paper focuses on the lead role that is played by the variation of the electron density grid into the ray tracing algorithm, which is correlated to the change of the electron content along the ionospheric ray path, for obtaining a ray tracing as much reliable as possible. In many cases of practical interest, the group delay time depends on the geometric length and the electron content of the ray path. The issue is faced theoretically, and a simple analytical relation, between the variation of the electron content along the path and the difference in time between the group delays, calculated and measured, both in the ionosphere and in the vacuum, is obtained and discussed. An example of how an oblique radio link can be improved by varying the electron density grid is also shown and discussed. © 2015 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Morphometric analysis is a key to understand the hydrological process and hence is a prerequisite for the assessment of hydrological characteristics of surface water basin. Morphometric analysis to determine the drainage characteristics of Palar sub-watershed, a part of Shanmukha watershed in the Amaravati sub-catchment is done using Advanced Space-borne Thermal Emission and Reflection Global Digital Elevation Model (ASTER GDEM) data, and is supplemented with topographical maps in geographical information systems platform. This study uses ASTER GDEM data to extract morphometric features of a mountain stream at micro-watershed level. The sub-watershed is divided into six micro-watersheds. The sub-watershed includes a sixth-order stream. Lower stream orders, in particular first-order streams, dominate the sub-watershed. Development of stream segments is controlled by slope and local relief. Drainage pattern of the sub-watershed and micro-watersheds is dendritic in general. The mean bifurcation ratio of the sub-watershed is 3.69 but its variation between the various stream orders suggests structural control in the development of stream network. The shape factors reveal the elongation of the sub-watershed and micro-watersheds.The relief ratio reveals the high discharge capability of the sub-watershed and meagre groundwater potential. This study is a useful tool for planning strategies in control of soil erosion and soil conservation. © 2013, Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={The objective of this study was to develop folate receptor mediated delivery of self assembled betulinic acid nano fibers (SA-BA) to human leukemic cells and to investigate their specific induction of apoptosis. The physicochemical properties of PEG conjugated SA-BA followed by conjugated with folic acid (FA-PEG-SA-BA) were examined using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetry analysis, X-ray diffraction analysis, thin layer chromatography and scanning electron microscopy. The stability of folic acid with PEG-SA-BA conjugate was higher at acidic pH, which helps to maintain the conjugate structure for internalization of folate receptor over expressing cells. FA-PEG-SA-BA showed good compatibility with normal cells. The internalization of FA-PEG-SA-BA was significantly observed in folate receptor over expressing K562 cells while showing comparatively lower impact on folate receptor lower expressing KG-1A cells. This intracellular localization of conjugate facilitated the generation of excess reactive oxygen species (ROS), followed by elevation of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) secretion. The effective contribution of ROS and TNF-α in FA-PEG-SA-BA mediated leukemic cell death was confirmed by pretreatment of cells with the ROS scavenger (N-acetyl-l-cysteine) and pentoxifylline, a potent TNF-α blocker. The mode of leukemic cell death was confirmed by flow-cytometric analysis. We also tested the possible involvement of caspase activation in TNF-α mediated leukemic cell death by immunoflouroscence staining of apoptotic marker proteins (caspase 8 and caspase 3). © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.},

abstract={Linear sweep voltammetric behaviour of methylglyoxal was investigated using Pt/ZnO flakes/GLO 1 bio-electrode and a new analytical method was developed for the precise and accurate determination of methylglyoxal in grilled chicken sample. This method was based on the electrochemical parameters measured for the increasing concentration of methylglyoxal. The electrochemical parameters calculated from the linear sweep voltammograms served as the dependent variables. The concentrations of methylglyoxal were employed as the independent variables. For each electrochemical parameter, a non-linear calibration equation was framed and its predictive performance was evaluated. The analytical performance of the proposed models was assessed with the aid of relative prediction error, % recovery and root mean square error for cross validation. The best results were obtained with current density versus [methylglyoxal]model (RPE=0.033, Recovery=97.379% and RMSECV = 1.429). This calibrated non-linear model was then applied for the determination of methylglyoxal in grilled chicken samples. The recovery of methylglyoxal in spiked grilled chicken was ranging from 95.895% to 108.191%. The predicted methylglyoxal values were very similar to that of the spiked methylglyoxal values.

abstract={Cloud computing has been considered as one of the important computing paradigm. Its main purpose is to share computing resources. With the current scenario there is no doubting the incredible impact that mobile technologies have had on both in scientific and commercial applications. The integration of emerging cloud computing concept and the potential mobile communication services is together considered as Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC). A prominent challenge by using mobile devices and the mobile cloud [1] is resource constraints of these handheld devices. The computational complexities in mobile devices compared to the desktop computers are due to its smaller screen size, less memory capacity, lower processing capacity and low battery backup. Due to these resource limitations most of the processing and data handlings are carried out in the cloud, which is known as software as a service (SaaS) cloud. The smart phones are used to access could resources by using the browser. Performance of this mobile cloud is impaired by the time varying characteristics such as, latency, jitter and bandwidth of the wireless channel. In this research we propose a modified task scheduling mechanism called Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) to address the issues related to the performance of mobile devices [5] when used in a cloud environment and Hadoop. However there are bottlenecks related to the existing task scheduling techniques in MCC model which uses the built in FIFO algorithm for large amount of tasks. The proposed Ant Colony Optimization algorithm improve the task scheduling process by dynamically scheduling the tasks and improve the throughput and quality of service (QoS) of MCC. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={The rationale of this case-control study was to explore the association of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) D299G, TLR4 T399I, TLR9 -1486 T>C, TIR-domain-containing adaptor protein (TIRAP) S180L and tumor necrosis-α (TNF-α) promoter polymorphisms with susceptibility and phenotypic heterogeneity of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). PCR-RFLP, real-time PCR was used for the genetic analysis and expression studies and ELISA was used for the determination of specific autoantibodies. TLR4 D299G was associated with the risk for SLE (OR: 1.57, 95% CI: 1.08-2.28), while the TNF-α (-1031, -863, -857) CCC haplotype conferred protection. TLR4 and TIRAP polymorphisms were associated with reduced expression of HLA-DR. The presence of TLR4 and TLR9 polymorphisms increases the MHC2TA expression, while TIRAP polymorphism was associated with reduced expression. TLR4 D299G showed an inverse association with pulmonary hypertension. TLR 4 T399I and TLR9 -1486T>C showed a positive association with seizures and photosensitivity, respectively. TIRAP S180L showed a positive association with alopecia and malar rashes, while an inverse association with psychosis was observed. TLR4 T399I (r=0.14, p=0.05) and TIRAP S180L (r=0.15, p=0.03) showed a positive association with anti-Ro antibodies. On the other hand, TLR9 -1486T>C showed an inverse association with anti-La antibodies (r=-0.20, p=0.006). To conclude, TLR4 D299G increases the risk for SLE, while TNF-α CCC haplotype reduces the risk for SLE. All these polymorphisms contribute toward phenotypic heterogeneity. TLR4 T399I, TLR9 -1486T>C and TIRAP S180L influence specific autoantibody production in SLE. © The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.},

abstract={Power electronic converters play a major role in wind energy conversion systems (WECS). A typical variable speed WECS includes wind turbine, permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) and power conditioners. In this study, a three-phase modular boost converter supplied from a PMSG and controlled using a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) is proposed for battery charging applications. Each phase of PMSG is connected to a single phase diode rectifier and a DC-DC boost converter. All boost converters have a common output capacitor and load. The proportional integral-based voltage controller provides voltage regulation on the DC side. A fixed frequency LQR based current controller applied for the individual phases provides a better three phase source utilisation. The instantaneous pq theory is adopted for the reference current calculation. Extensive simulation studies based on the models developed using MATLAB/SIMULINK reveal that the proposed system performs satisfactorily for step variations in wind speed and load. The performance of the low power prototype developed and controlled using a dSPACE 1104 digital signal processor shows good output voltage regulation and better source utilisation for wide variations in load. © 2015 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.},

abstract={Purpose: A novel three dimensional (3D) culture system purely synthesised from co-polymer which is free from biological contamination for Huh7 cell cultivation and hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication has been attempted. Materials and Methods: Mebiolgel, a thermo-reversible gelation polymer was used as a 3D scaffold for culturing Huh7, a liver carcinoma cell line used in our study. The 3D culture of the cells were infected with cell culture derived HCV. Result: The scaffold supported the cell growth as 3D spheroids for up to 63 days. Moreover mebiolgel was found to be improving the hepatocyte differentiation of Huh7 cells at the transcript level. Three dimensional culture was susceptible for HCV infection, and this was confirmed by detecting the HCV replication intermediate viral core antigen.Conclusion: Mebiolgel based culture system was proven to be suited for 3D culture of Huh7 cells by improvising liver specific genotypic expression and was susceptible for HCV replication. Since mebiolgel based Huh 7 express better hepatocyte differentiation markers genotypically, this can be implemented as an alternate for primary hepatocytes in studies such as viral isolation from patient serum. © 2015 Indian Journal of Medical Microbiology Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.},

abstract={Power quality is an important issue in low-voltage DC (LVDC) grids which drives light-emitting diode lighting system and many other DC loads in residential applications. The requirement of high-quality power to the lighting system necessitates power factor correction (PFC). This study presents a three-phase modular AC-to-DC converter with a simple controller for PFC in LVDC grids under balanced and unbalanced supply voltage conditions. The proposed circuit consists of three separate single-phase boost converter modules. Each module includes a diode rectifier at the front end, followed by a boost converter. The main advantage of this converter is module loss operation where the DC supply given to the lighting system and other DC loads will be continued even in case of failure of one module. The 24 V DC output voltage is regulated using an outer proportional-integral controller and the input current wave shape in each phase is improved by three individual hysteresis controllers. The controller works successfully in tracking the reference voltage changes in order to vary the regulated DC output voltage. The effectiveness of the controller has been verified by the results obtained through MATLAB/SIMULINK. A prototype model has been developed to validate this system and tested using dSPACE1104 processor. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2015.},

abstract={LCN2 (Lipocalin 2) is a 25 KD secreted acute phase protein, reported to be a novel regulator of angiogenesis in breast cancer. Up regulation of LCN2 had been observed in multiple cancers including breast cancer, pancreatic cancer and ovarian cancer. However, the role of LCN2 promoter methylation in the formation of microvessels is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to analyze the association of LCN 2 promoter methylation with microvessel formation and tumor cell proliferation in breast cancer patients. The LCN2 promoter methylation status was studied in 64 breast cancer tumors by methylation specific PCR (MSP). Evaluation of microvessel density (MVD) and Ki67 cell proliferation index was achieved by immunohistochemical staining using CD34 and MIB-1 antibodies, respectively. LCN2 promoter unmethylation status was observed in 43 (67.2%) of breast cancer patients whereas LCN2 methylation status was seen in 21 (32.8%). Further, LCN2 promoter unmethylation status was associated with aggressive tumor phenotype and elevated mean MVD in breast cancer patients.},

abstract={Cancer is a leading cause of mortality and the annual incidence of new cancer cases is rising worldwide. Due to the frequent development of resistance and the side effects of established anti-cancer drugs, the quest for new drugs with improved therapeutic features goes on. In contrast to cytotoxic chemotherapy of the past, the concept of targeted chemotherapy attempts to increase specificity of therapy by attacking tumor-related mechanisms. A novel emerging treatment concept represents the inhibition of centrosomal clustering. The centrosome regulates mitotic spindle formation assuring uniform separation of chromosomes to daughter cells. Many tumors contain supernumerary centrosomes, which contribute to aneuploidy induction via multipolar mitotic spindle formation. As spindle multipolarity leads to cell death, tumor cells developed centrosomal clustering mechanism to prevent multipolar spindle formation by coalescence of multiple centrosomes into two functional spindle poles. Inhibition of centrosome clustering represents a novel strategy for drug development and leads to the formation of multipolar spindles and subsequent cell death. In the present review, we report advances in understanding the biology of centrosomal clustering as well as enlist compounds capable of inducing the formation of multipolar spindles such as indolquinolizines, integrin-linked kinase inhibitors (QLT-0267), noscapinoids (EM011), phthalamide derivatives (TC11), griseofulvin, phenanthridines (PJ-34), CCC1-01, CW069 GF-15, colcemid, nocodazole, paclitaxel, and vinblastine. We also present in silico result of compounds that bind to γ-tubulin under the ambit of centrosomal clustering inhibition. We observed maximum binding efficacy in GF-15, CW069, paclitaxel and larotaxel with GF-15 exhibiting least energy of -8.4 Kcal/mol and 0.7 μM Pki value. © 2015 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={Background: The human homologue of the mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) gene is a negative regulator of Tp53. MDM2-309T>G a functional promoter polymorphism was found to be associated with overexpression thereby attenuation of Tp53 stress response and increased cancer susceptibility. We have planned to evaluate the possible role of MDM2-309T>G polymorphism with risk and response to chemotherapy in AML. Materials and Methods: A total of 223 de novo AML cases and 304 age and sex matched healthy controls were genotyped for the MDM2-309T>G polymorphism through the tetra-primer amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS)-PCR method. In order to assess the functional relationship of -309T>G SNP with MDM2 expression level, we quantified MDM2 mRNA in 30 primary AML blood samples through quantitative RT-PCR. Both the (-309T>G) genotypes and the MDM2 expression were correlated with disease free survival (DFS) rates among patients who have achieved complete remission (CR) after first induction chemotherapy. Results: MDM2-309T>G polymorphism was significantly associated with AML development (p<0.0001). The presence of either GG genotype or G allele at MDM2-309 confered 1.79 (95% CI: 1.12-2.86; p<0.001) and 1.46 fold (95%CI: 1.14-1.86; p= 0.003) increased AML risk. Survival analysis revealed that CR+ve cases with GG genotype had significantly increased DFS rates (16months, p=0.05) compared to CR+ve TT (11 months) and TG (9 months) genotype groups. Further, MDM2 expression was also found to be significantly elevated in GG genotype patients (p=0.0039) and among CR+ve cases (p=0.0036). Conclusions: The MDM2-309T>G polymorphism might be involved in AML development and also serve as a good prognostic indicator.},

abstract={Clinical evidence shows that dual inhibition of kinases as well angiogenesis provides ideal therapeutic option in the treatment of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) than inhibiting either of these with the events separately. Although treatment with dual inhibitors has shown good clinical responses in patients with MTC, it has been associated with serious side effects. Some inhibitors are active agents for both angiogenesis or kinase activity. Owing to narrow therapeutic window of established inhibitors, the present study aims to identify high affinity dual inhibitors targeting RET and VEGFR2 respectively for kinase and angiogenesis activity. Established inhibitors like Vandetanib, Cabozantinib, Motesanib, PP121, RAF265 and Sunitinib served as query parent compounds for identification of structurally similar compounds by Tanimoto-based similarity searching with a threshold of 95% against the PubChem database. All the parent inhibitors and respective similar compounds were docked against RET and VEGFR2 in order to retrieve high affinity compounds with these two proteins. AGN-PC-0CUK9P PubCID: 59320403 a compound related to PPI21 showed almost equal affinity for RET and VEGFR2 and unlike other screened compounds with no apparent bias for either of the receptors. Further, AGNPC- 0CUK9P demonstrated appreciable interaction with both RET and VEGFR2 and superior kinase activity in addition to showed optimal ADMET properties and pharmacophore features. From our in silico investigation we suggest AGN-PC-0CUK9P as a superior dual inhibitor targeting RET and VEGFR2 with high efficacy which should be proposed for pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic studies for improved treatment of MTC.},

abstract={Objective: Andrographis paniculata (A. paniculata) Nees is an important medicinal plant found in the tropical regions and has been traditionally used in Indian and Chinese medicinal systems. A. paniculata is found to exhibit anti-snake venom properties; however its inhibitory potential on multi-toxic Phospholipases A2 and its associated inflammatory reactions is not clearly understood. Henceforth, in this study we evaluate the inhibitory/neutralizing potential of alcoholic extract of A. paniculata on the isolated multi-toxic PLA2 (of Daboii rusellii pulchella and Naja naja) and its induced edema in Swiss albino mice. Methods: The multi-toxic-svPLA2-VRV-PL-V from the venom of Daboii rusellii pulchella was purified according established methods. The inhibition of enzymatic activity and edema inducing activity was carried out according to established methods. Results: A. paniculata extract dose dependently inhibited the multi-toxic svPLA2 enzymatic activity with an IC50 value of 12.4±0.6 μg/ml. Further, the extract dose dependently inhibited the edema formation, when co-injected with the enzyme indicating a strong correlation between lipolytic activity and pro-inflammatory activity. Conclusion: The ethanolic extract of A. paniculata effectively inhibited the multi-toxic svPLA2 and its associated edema inducing activities, which substantiate their anti-ophidian properties. Further study is interesting to develop them into potent anti-ophidian agents. © 2015, International Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Science. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Web Transport Systems (WTS) are used in material processing industries to maintain constant tension on the transported material (web), that is required for assuring material integrity and to reduce production down-time. Maintaining constant web tension in the presence of disturbance is a challenging task. This investigation presents a cascade control design, with online supervisory web tension control using Generalized Predictive Controller (GPC) in major loop and offline evolutionary optimization based PI controller in the inner loop. Two algorithms are used to tune the inner PI controller: Real coded Genetic Algorithm (RGA) and Bacterial Foraging Particle Swarm Optimization (BF-PSO), due to their ability to solve non-linear optimization problems and convergence to global optimum. Our results indicate that the GPC –BF-PSO cascaded control design shows better performance by regulating tension without violating physical constraints in the presence of process and external disturbances, when compared to GPC – RGA cascaded control design. © 2015, Budapest Tech Polytechnical Institution.

abstract={Abstract Cobalt oxide (Co<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf>) nanoparticles were prepared by simple, facile and cost effective sol-gel route. Triethanol amine (TEA) was used as surfactant to reduce the size of the particles.

The morphological and elemental composition of the samples was investigated by SEM and EDS. The optical studies revealed the possible electronic transitions which are responsible for an occurrence of two energy band gap in cobalt oxide. The photoluminescence probe for the presence of defects and the results obtained specified that the defects get reduced with the addition of surfactant TEA.

The maximum available nutrient content was estimated at after 40 days of inoculation of FDS 15 such as 88mg, 9.10mg and 72.0 mg per kg of N, P and K respectively under sand 2 kg + 30 % of cleaned feather (T1). The decomposition of feather was faster in the treatment which inoculated FDS 15 except control which might be due to drastic multiplication FDS15 bacteria. The minimum available nutrient of 19mg, 5.85mg and 56.5mg in N, P and K respectively recorded under control (sand alone). The results of mineralization estimate showed that FDS15 Bacillus subtilis was increase the decomposition process of feather even increase the quantity of substrate (feather) which leads to convert the higher content of nutrients in the soil. Generally, the pH and EC of the substrate were on par with treatments. It indicates that the inclusion of the organisms in poultry waste compost was successful in producing an odourless, pathogen free product with complete biological degradation waste in 40 days of the feather. The application of this system may improve the rapid disposal of poultry waste as well as the public and environmental health in the region.},

abstract={Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), a ciliopathy disorder with pleiotropic effect manifests primarily as retinal degeneration along with renal insufficiency, polydactyly and obesity. In this study, we have performed homozygosity mapping using NspI 250K affymetrix gene chip followed by mutation screening of the candidate genes located in the homozygous blocks. These regions are prioritized based on the block length and candidature of the genes in BBS and other ciliopathies. Gene alterations in known BBS (22) and other ciliopathy genes such as ALMS1 (2) were seen in 24 of 30 families (80%). Mutations in BBS3 gene, inclusive of a novel recurrent mutation (p.I91T) accounted for 18% of the identified variations. Disease associated polymorphisms p.S70N (BBS2), rs1545 and rs1547 (BBS6) were also observed. This is the first study in Indian BBS patients and homozygosity mapping has proved to be an effective tool in prioritizing the candidate genes in consanguineous pedigrees. The study reveals a different mutation profile in the ciliopathy genes in Indian population and implication of novel loci/genes in 20% of the study group. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.},

abstract={Multiple questions relating to contributions of cultural and demographical factors in the process of human geographical dispersal remain largely unanswered. India, a land of early human settlement and the resulting diversity is a good place to look for some of the answers. In this study, we explored the genetic structure of India using a diverse panel of 78 males genotyped using the GenoChip. Their genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) diversity was examined in the context of various covariates that influence Indian gene pool. Admixture analysis of genome-wide SNP data showed high proportion of the Southwest Asian component in all of the Indian samples. Hierarchical clustering based on admixture proportions revealed seven distinct clusters correlating to geographical and linguistic affiliations. Convex hull overlay of Y-chromosomal haplogroups on the genome-wide SNP principal component analysis brought out distinct non-overlapping polygons of F∗-M89, H∗-M69, L1-M27, O2a-M95 and O3a3c1-M117, suggesting a male-mediated migration and expansion of the Indian gene pool. Lack of similar correlation with mitochondrial DNA clades indicated a shared genetic ancestry of females. We suggest that ancient male-mediated migratory events and settlement in various regional niches led to the present day scenario and peopling of India. © 2015 The Japan Society of Human Genetics.},

abstract={The origin and dispersal of Y-Chromosomal haplogroup O2a1-M95, distributed across the Austro Asiatic speaking belt of East and South Asia, are yet to be fully understood. Various studies have suggested either an East Indian or Southeast Asian origin of O2a1-M95. We addressed the issue of antiquity and dispersal of O2a1-M95 by sampling 8748 men from India, Laos, and China and compared them to 3307 samples from other intervening regions taken from the literature. Analyses of haplogroup frequency and Y-STR data on a total 2413 O2a1-M95 chromosomes revealed that the Laos samples possessed the highest frequencies of O2a1-M95 (74% with >0.5) and its ancestral haplogroups (O2-P31, O-M175) as well as a higher proportion of samples with 14STR-median haplotype (17 samples in 14 populations), deep coalescence time (5.7-±-0.3 Kya) and consorted O2a1-M95 expansion evidenced from STR evolution. All these suggested Laos to carry a deep antiquity of O2a1-M95 among the study regions. A serial decrease in expansion time from east to west: 5.7-±-0.3 Kya in Laos, 5.2-±-0.6 in Northeast India, and 4.3-±-0.2 in East India, suggested a late Neolithic east to west spread of the lineage O2a1-M95 from Laos. © 2015 Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences.},

abstract={Targeted therapies and the consequent adoption of "personalized" oncology have achieved notablesuccesses in some cancers; however, significant problems remain with this approach. Many targetedtherapies are highly toxic, costs are extremely high, and most patients experience relapse after a fewdisease-free months. Relapses arise from genetic heterogeneity in tumors, which harbor therapy-resistantimmortalized cells that have adopted alternate and compensatory pathways (i.e., pathways that are notreliant upon the same mechanisms as those which have been targeted). To address these limitations, aninternational task force of 180 scientists was assembled to explore the concept of a low-toxicity "broad-spectrum" therapeutic approach that could simultaneously target many key pathways and mechanisms. Using cancer hallmark phenotypes and the tumor microenvironment to account for the various aspectsof relevant cancer biology, interdisciplinary teams reviewed each hallmark area and nominated a widerange of high-priority targets (74 in total) that could be modified to improve patient outcomes. For thesetargets, corresponding low-toxicity therapeutic approaches were then suggested, many of which werephytochemicals. Proposed actions on each target and all of the approaches were further reviewed forknown effects on other hallmark areas and the tumor microenvironment. Potential contrary or procar-cinogenic effects were found for 3.9% of the relationships between targets and hallmarks, and mixedevidence of complementary and contrary relationships was found for 7.1%. Approximately 67% of therelationships revealed potentially complementary effects, and the remainder had no known relationship. Among the approaches, 1.1% had contrary, 2.8% had mixed and 62.1% had complementary relationships. These results suggest that a broad-spectrum approach should be feasible from a safety standpoint. Thisnovel approach has potential to be relatively inexpensive, it should help us address stages and types ofcancer that lack conventional treatment, and it may reduce relapse risks. A proposed agenda for futureresearch is offered. © 2015 The Authors.},
